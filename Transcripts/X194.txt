PATIENT X194
Yeah because I was running out of the uh diabetic pills.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
And they gave me a temporary issuance of; I think they gave me a 45 day supply.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

It's time to just repeat everything anyway.

PATIENT X194
Okay.

DOCTOR X194
Um so.  Now I'm going to ask you a question.  You may not remember it and its okay if you don't.  Do you remember what your hemoglobin A1c test was?  It tells your long term control for your diabetes.

DOCTOR X194

PATIENT X194
The first thing that happened that nobody caught on to it, when I went swimming I would get a severe pain along side my toenail but there was no sliver there.

DOCTOR X194
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X194
Then a little later on then she got the diagnosis test came through on the diabetic thing.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  Okay any trouble with your hearing?

PATIENT X194
Yeah frequency.

DOCTOR X194
How long have you known that?  Were you diagnosed?

PATIENT X194
Yeah uh, well actually I get the final number to it but they think it was coming on for a long time cause I was a security police for the Air Force.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
The jet engine noise and then I was on the police department and sheriff's department here in xxx.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
So we're shooting gun range noise and then one day my tractor tire froze to the axel and I used a metal thing to try to hammer it out.

DOCTOR X194
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X194
And I was under a deck.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
And it created a lot of echoing and when I went in the house I was on the far side of the living room, the TV was on and I realized I could not understand the people talking on the TV.

DOCTOR X194
Yeah.  So have you needed hearing aids?

PATIENT X194
And it didn't get better later.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  When did you see Audiology last?

PATIENT X194
About a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
I had an hearing test done and they said it was the frequency.  I can hear deep frequency.

DOCTOR X194
@@@ okay.

PATIENT X194
But all the words are kind of different.  When high frequency enters the word sometimes then I miss it.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  How long have you had hearing loss?

PATIENT X194
Oh I probably had it without realizing for a while.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
But the actual, when I really did all that hammering.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
You know it was like probably the last straw for the eardrums.

DOCTOR X194
I'm going to get you to the Lab today.

PATIENT X194
Okay.

DOCTOR X194
Okay and we'll get electrolytes.  Just a standard blood count just so that we have it on file and then you're diabetic test, your hemoglobin A1c and then I'll check your liver.  The cholesterol, did you eat lunch today?

PATIENT X194
Huh?

DOCTOR X194
Did you eat lunch?

PATIENT X194
No.

DOCTOR X194
No, okay you didn't. 

PATIENT X194
No because I expected you might be sending to the Lab.

DOCTOR X194
Right.  Did you eat breakfast?

PATIENT X194
No.

DOCTOR X194
Good, okay let's do your cholesterol.

PATIENT X194
I had coffee this morning.

DOCTOR X194
That's okay.

PATIENT X194
Alright.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  So we'll get your cholesterol.  I'll get your prostrate lab and some urine tests.  Okay.  And send you to Audiology for your hearing.  Have they talked with you about hearing aids before?

PATIENT X194
Pardon?

DOCTOR X194
Have they ever talked to you about hearing aids before?

PATIENT X194
Oh when I had that first hearing test.

DOCTOR X194
Okay but then it got better so they didn't want to do that and then I'll put in a referral for your um because you're due for a colonoscopy and actually a lot of these tests are the same @@@.  But I'll check that one and this is for a colonoscopy.  This is a screening for colorectal cancer.  You have a prosthetic heart valve?

PATIENT X194
Pardon?

DOCTOR X194
Any trouble with your heart valve?

PATIENT X194
No.

DOCTOR X194
No pacemaker or defibrillator?  You don't need oxygen?

PATIENT X194
No.

DOCTOR X194
No recent stroke or heart attack?

PATIENT X194
Nope.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  No stents in your heart?

PATIENT X194
Nope.

DOCTOR X194
And you're not on Plavix, Coumadin, Aggrenox.  You are on aspirin every day?  Are you on an aspirin every day?

PATIENT X194
Yes.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  Um and you're okay with having a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X194
Yeah.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  Have you ever been screened for an aneurysm in your aorta?

PATIENT X194
I don't know.

DOCTOR X194
Okay you smoked for a while and you have diabetes, high cholesterol, um your blood pressure looks okay but all of that together puts at high risk for having maybe aneurysm of your aorta.  And an aneurysm is like, you know how you see bubble gum and you blow a bubble and if you blew a bubble, the bubble is a thin layer of gum compared to the rest of the gum that you're chewing in your mouth so the wall of your aorta pouches out like that and is very thin and it could rupture.  And so if it ruptures um, so what we do is we screen for it and if we see that you have one and it's a certain size, very little, we just watch it but if we see that it grows fast or that it's big then we refer you to a vascular surgeon so that they can fix it.

PATIENT X194
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X194
So we can elect you to be screened for that knowing that if it's large then you'd have to go to surgery for it.  When they rupture 50% are fatal so that's why we screen for them, in males who have high risks and who smoked.  Would you like to elect for it, it's an ultrasound, it's an ultrasound.  Okay.  Okay, so we'll do that screening test too.  Alright.  Let me just um, standing you up here and I'll look at your feet.

PATIENT X194
Okay.

DOCTOR X194
You need an eye exam.  So I'll have you sit there and we can start with removing your socks and shoes.  Since you have smoked for 50 years, it's just to make sure that you don't have that.  Okay you can sit back.  

PATIENT X194
Oh I did have one kind of surgery I forgot to mention.  What do they call it, um?

DOCTOR X194
A laminectomy?

PATIENT X194
When the thing bubbles out and pushes against the nerve bundle?

DOCTOR X194
Oh stenosis, spinal stenosis.

PATIENT X194
Yeah, the soft tissue in the spine?  Uh it herniated out.

DOCTOR X194
Oh a herniated disk.

PATIENT X194
Yes.  They did a laser discectomy on it.

DOCTOR X194
Oh when was that?

PATIENT X194
It was uh, it was maybe a year to a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.  Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath okay.  You can breathe normally.  Hold your breath okay and breathe.  Okay and hold your breath again.  Okay.  Any belly pain?  Any chest pain?

PATIENT X194

DOCTOR X194
Okay, alright.  Did you have Viagra before?

PATIENT X194

DOCTOR X194
No, you've never tried it before okay?  So why do you think you need it now?

PATIENT X194
It ain't working.

DOCTOR X194
Okay.

PATIENT X194
Also because I heard on the net that it opens up blood cells and @@@ too.

DOCTOR X194
Okay what are you using for?

PATIENT X194
Pardon?

DOCTOR X194
You're using it for sexual activity right?  Viagra.

PATIENT X194
I would need it for that but.

DOCTOR X194
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X194
But it might open up blood cells around the feet a little bit so my feet feel a little warmer too.

DOCTOR X194
Hmm, well you wouldn't take it that often to do that.

PATIENT X194
Huh?

DOCTOR X194
You wouldn't take it that often to see it affect long term like that.

PATIENT X194
Yeah.  Okay.

DOCTOR X194
If you were just taking it intermittently.

PATIENT X194
Yeah.

DOCTOR X194

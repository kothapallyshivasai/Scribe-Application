PATIENT X622
Uh the doctor, I saw the doctor outside.  I got the nurse and a doctor coming over to the house.

DOCTOR X622

DOCTOR X622
Okay.

DOCTOR X622
Okay.

PATIENT X622
There are two medicines.

DOCTOR X622
Okay yeah we can get them for you.

PATIENT X622
I could want to know how come I got the shingles for the longest.

DOCTOR X622
How, why you have shingles?  You can have the shingles, yeah I understand.

PATIENT X622
Yeah I want to know.

DOCTOR X622
There's no reason, people just get it.

PATIENT X622
Huh?

DOCTOR X622
People just get it.  If you had um, people just get it.  There's no reason people get it.

PATIENT X622
Yeah but why do I have the pain so long?

DOCTOR X622
That's, it lasts a long time.

PATIENT X622
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah.

PATIENT X622
Even when I get medicine from the doctor, @@@.

DOCTOR X622
These are just pain medications to kind of help but it doesn't, it's not curing anything.

PATIENT X622
Oh no.

DOCTOR X622
No, we don't really have a medication to cure it.  You just have to wait for it to get better.

PATIENT X622
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah.

PATIENT X622
The @@@ two more years and that's good for me?

DOCTOR X622
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X622
@@@.

DOCTOR X622
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X622
And he said that @@@ he got this when he was 20.

DOCTOR X622
Hmm.

PATIENT X622
Why do he have it when he was 20?

DOCTOR X622
I don't know him.  I don't know why he had it when he was 20.

PATIENT X622
I talked to him and he said that he got a cream, he said a xxxadryl cream.

DOCTOR X622
xxxadryl cream.

PATIENT X622
The doctor gave him the xxxadryl cream and he had it about a month and that was it.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah.  I don't know what xxxadryl cream is.  I don't know what he had.

PATIENT X622
Yeah he got the shingles.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah.

PATIENT X622
When he was 20.

DOCTOR X622
That's odd to get it in your 20s.

PATIENT X622
Yeah I talked to another guy and he said that he had it when he was 40.  So why did I wait until I'm 74 and then I get it?

DOCTOR X622
Some people, people get it at different times.  It's hard to say.  Not everybody gets it you know 20 or 40 or 50 and some people don't ever get it.

PATIENT X622
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah.

PATIENT X622
But he got it when he was 20.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah.

PATIENT X622
@@@ now.  Okay well then uh.

DOCTOR X622
Do you check your blood sugars at home?

PATIENT X622
Yeah.

DOCTOR X622
What do they run?

PATIENT X622
Oh man they run high.

DOCTOR X622
And you take the medication right?

PATIENT X622
Yes.

DOCTOR X622
Well how much are you taking of the metformin?

PATIENT X622
Metformin I'm taking 1000.

DOCTOR X622
You're taking 1000 okay.

PATIENT X622
I'm taking 1000 in the morning and 1000 in the evening.

DOCTOR X622
Okay.

PATIENT X622
It was 252 now.

DOCTOR X622
Your blood sugars?

PATIENT X622
Yes.

DOCTOR X622
Okay.

PATIENT X622
It went to 254, now yesterday was 179.

DOCTOR X622
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X622
So the metformin stuff is good.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah but that's not enough.

PATIENT X622
Well @@@ blood sugar supposed to be the way they checking it here 200s.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah we're gonna have to add another medication, is that okay?

PATIENT X622
No.

DOCTOR X622
Why not?

PATIENT X622
What other medication, I'm taking enough.

DOCTOR X622
Well probably either glyburide or it’s another pill.

PATIENT X622
Uh let me think it over on this one and then I give you the ideas.

DOCTOR X622
But your blood sugars are too high.

PATIENT X622
Not too high because the 170s, probably if they go over 400s and 300s.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah but 200 is still high.

PATIENT X622
And they came down to 200 and they came down to 170s.

DOCTOR X622
That's still too high.  We want it below 1, you know around 120.

PATIENT X622
Uh give me the time on the time out, @@@.

DOCTOR X622
You started.

PATIENT X622
Started in March.

DOCTOR X622
In the beginning of March.

PATIENT X622
Yes that started, that's what it takes but I didn't know.

DOCTOR X622
But that's long enough.

PATIENT X622
I think that's what it takes.  Let me continue with this and @@@.

DOCTOR X622
Okay.  You know it puts you at higher risk of having a heart attack right.

PATIENT X622
Ah.

DOCTOR X622
And it's probably why your shingles isn't healing.

PATIENT X622
What about that cause the shingle now, let me continue with it 200 and try not to help it.

DOCTOR X622
Okay.

PATIENT X622
@@@.

DOCTOR X622
Alright.  Your blood pressure's too high too.

PATIENT X622
Yeah but I check it sometimes its high, sometimes it’s okay.

DOCTOR X622
But you're taking the medications?

PATIENT X622
Yes.

DOCTOR X622
Oh you are on glipizide.

PATIENT X622
Yes I say I'm on the glipizide.

DOCTOR X622
You are.  How much are you taking?

PATIENT X622
Taking, I don't know, I don't remember @@@.  Glipizide.  

DOCTOR X622
You're taking 10 maybe.

PATIENT X622
Yes 10 mg glipizide.

DOCTOR X622
10 okay.

PATIENT X622
Amlodipine I'm taking it @@@.

DOCTOR X622
If we can increase the glipizide, we can always do that but would you be okay with that?

PATIENT X622
With what?

DOCTOR X622
With increasing the glipizide?

PATIENT X622
No.  Because I'm taking glipizide and I'm taking metformin.

DOCTOR X622
I know but your blood sugar is too high.  Are you, did you take the enalapril today?

PATIENT X622
Yeah.

DOCTOR X622
You did?

PATIENT X622
Yes.

DOCTOR X622
Would you be okay with adding another medication for your blood pressure?

PATIENT X622
No.

DOCTOR X622
@@@.

PATIENT X622
They changed it from what it is.

DOCTOR X622
Are you taking amlodipine, you said you're taking amlodipine too.

PATIENT X622
That's another well see I'm taking @@@.  I'm taking gabapentin, taking @@@.

DOCTOR X622
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X622
I'm taking metformin.

DOCTOR X622
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X622
Taking pantoprazole and taking enalapril.

DOCTOR X622
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X622
That's enough pills for one person.

DOCTOR X622
Are you taking amlodipine or not?

PATIENT X622
I am taking amlodipine.  That's too many pills for one person.

DOCTOR X622
Uh the problem is your, okay you know the risks though.  Your blood pressure's too high, you can have a stroke.

PATIENT X622
If the blood pressure's too high and the blood pressures go down, blood pressures go down, blood pressure was 252 and it went down right now to 179, 160, 149.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah but that's still too high.

PATIENT X622
139, you want it 120 right?

DOCTOR X622
Yeah I do.

PATIENT X622
Yep, 120.

DOCTOR X622
Alright work on your diabetes first, that's the main thing.

PATIENT X622
Sometimes it goes down; blood pressure goes down, goes up and goes down.

DOCTOR X622
Alright, we're gonna see you back in a month.  If your blood sugar is still too high.

PATIENT X622
Yeah.

DOCTOR X622
We're gonna have to add something or go up on one of your medications.

PATIENT X622
Yeah.

DOCTOR X622
Okay.

PATIENT X622
Yeah.

DOCTOR X622
Is that okay.

PATIENT X622
Yeah one month, yeah.

DOCTOR X622
In one month and it may have to be insulin.

PATIENT X622
No, I don't want to do it.

DOCTOR X622
Even if it means you could die?

PATIENT X622
Exactly.  I don't want no insulin.

DOCTOR X622
Okay well I want you to think about it.

PATIENT X622
@@@.  Sometimes it coming up and @@@.  What I want to do is get rid of this pain.

DOCTOR X622
We'll work on the pain okay.  But that's also not going to get better if your blood sugar is too high, your body can't fight infections.

PATIENT X622
That so.

DOCTOR X622
And that's what's happening.  So shingles is an infection.

PATIENT X622
They say that shingles come from a virus.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah it is a virus and that's an infection and your body can't fight it if your blood sugar is too high.

PATIENT X622
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X622
Yeah.

PATIENT X622
Hmm, what can they do for the blood sugars?

DOCTOR X622
That's what I'm saying.  We could either increase, I don't know I have to check if I can increase your glipizide but I think you might be on the maximum dose and then we would have to add insulin.

PATIENT X622
@@@.

DOCTOR X622
The glipizide, the 10 mg.

PATIENT X622
@@@ diabetes, I be taking the glipizide, I'm taking enough glipizide.

DOCTOR X622
Well for some people that's enough but for you it’s not.  Your diabetes is more severe.

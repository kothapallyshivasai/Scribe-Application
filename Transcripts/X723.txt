DOCTOR X723
PATIENT.

PATIENT X723 
Yeah.

DOCTOR X723
I'm sorry hi.  What kind of problem have you had?

PATIENT X723
@@@. They've heard everything, the whole thing.

DOCTOR X723
Uh-huh.  Um okay so the last time I saw you, I saw you in Urgent Care right?

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X723
Alright.  And we gave you, we did the x-rays and um we started you on the ibuprofen.  Have you been taking the ibuprofen?

PATIENT X723
Yes.

DOCTOR X723
Okay and that's not helping?

PATIENT X723
Well it's slacked up you know.  It worked if I take two of them.

DOCTOR X723
Uh-huh.  How many have you been taking?

PATIENT X723
I just took, I been taking one at a time then I do two and that seemed to help me much better.

DOCTOR X723
How many times a day have you been taking two?

PATIENT X723
Just once.

DOCTOR X723
Just once a day?

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X723
So you've just been taking two pills a day basically?

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X723
Alright give me one second I'm just gonna review the, probably look at the x-ray myself okay.

PATIENT X723
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  10:00  DOCTOR IN:  17:46)

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Sorry about that.

PATIENT X723
NAME.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yeah no, no, I think it's @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X723
Alright you're gonna get that done.  We definitely want to do that.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yeah sorry about that.  Um so the x-rays.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
We reviewed the x-rays when I saw you in Urgent Care it showed evidence of osteoarthritis.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Have you heard of that before?  So there's two kinds of arthritis, well this actually well several different kinds of arthritis um but the two that everyone knows is rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

PATIENT X723
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Osteoarthritis is the one that you have and it's basically wear and tear.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You know as you get older.  Anyone who lives long enough is probably going to have osteoarthritis in one or more of their joints and you know you got two bones that touch each other over 65 years and you know.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Kind of wears down so.  Um what you see typically on the x-rays is you know the bones are like this you know.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And with osteoarthritis you see narrowing so the bones get a little bit closer. 

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Sometimes they have um, you see degrading of the surface you know.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And so that's what they saw in both of the knees.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
@@@ so the question is what do you do about it?  Um several things you can do um you can do, well the first thing you try to do is just control the pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen.  Then what you can also, you know, going up from that or you know if you're not getting enough pain control then you go with other things.  You know there are different medicines and you can also do injections, injections of the joint with um a steroid.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And that kind of lowers the inflammation and it usually helps with the pain.  Um patients who get that usually get pain relief for a month or two and they have to come you know several times a year to get re-injected and then after that um you know there's other things that you can go on and then there are other things that you can do to kind of help with the pain.  You can strengthen the muscles around the joint uh mainly you know the leg muscles you've got here um.  So you know there's things that we can do.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um but unfortunately all of the things that we do don't really cure it.

PATIENT X723
No.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
There really is no cure I mean it's hard to cure you know worn down knees.

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
So um you know everything that we, you know the treatments that we offer are basically controlling the pain, trying to minimize further damage to the joint and so on okay.  So you I mean, it's probably @@@ right.

PATIENT X723
Right uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um yeah and it shows it's been getting worse in the last few years um and I started you on some ibuprofen.  So how do you feel?  I mean is the pain better than it was when I first saw you?

PATIENT X723
Well it's I can walk and do everything.  It's not like if I'm sitting here and I ain't having no problem getting up because it seem like it tightens up.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Tightens up.

PATIENT X723
Yeah like that.  As long as I'm walking and everything @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Uh-huh good.  You know and you're only taking, when do you take the ibuprofen that I prescribed?  You're just taking it once a day you said right?  Take two tablets once a day?

PATIENT X723
When I get ready to go to work.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Okay and what do you do?  Do you work nights or?

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You work nights?

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
So you, you know take it in the evening basically before you go to work.

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
It gets you through the.

PATIENT X723
Yeah, right, right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
All night.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Okay.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And then you get home and it hurts.

PATIENT X723
It hurt all day anyway but uh it just eases the pain that's all.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Uh-huh.  The other thing we can do, so you can take you know you're taking, they say that the safe amount.  You know with every medicine there's a limit as to how much you can take.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um the medicine that you're taking is 2.4 mg.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Give or take and you're taking 600 or so and you can take about four of those tablets a day.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh but I ain't taking nowhere close to that.  

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yean and the other thing that you know what you can do is you can take it more often so what I was just thinking another option would be right now you've got I gave you the prescription for the 600.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
We can do 800 which is a little bit higher of a dose.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And you can do that like three times a day.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You know so that way it's like, you know you get it before you go to work and then you know you can take it when you get home from work you know, so you'd be kind of like spacing it out.

PATIENT X723
Right, right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You know what I'm saying um that could be another option.  I mean I guess I'm trying to get a sense of what your, what your thoughts are.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
If it's just pain that.

PATIENT X723
No it's not a boom, stopping me from doing anything.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X723
It's just, it's there.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
It's there.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
How and like 0-10 what would you think it would be?

PATIENT X723
Before the medicine, before the ibuprofen it was about a 8.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And now?

PATIENT X723
When I take it it's good.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You have no pain when you take it?

PATIENT X723
Oh I have pain all the time regardless if I take it or not.  It's just not as pronounced when I take it.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
So you were an 8 before.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And then what does it bring it down to?

PATIENT X723
It come on down to about a 6 or something like that you know.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X723
Cause sometimes I'll be walking all night.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Well the other thing I mean we can give you something else too you know um.  Six you know I, there's different, you know everyone's different but the ideal is to get it down to about a 4.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Okay uh so what we can do and I'm just looking at your labs.  We checked all your labs in February.  Checked your livers, kidneys, all that looks good so.  Um yeah I think we should add something, you know like a different type of medicine so um we'll try that.  Does that sound okay?

PATIENT X723
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um you know no one likes to take more pills but this is something that you would take as needed.

PATIENT X723
Hmm, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um the medicine that you're on you've been taking.  Are you still taking the tramadol?

PATIENT X723
What is that one?

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Tramadol is for pain too.

PATIENT X723
No, no I don't take that.  Ibuprofen is the only thing I'm taking.

FIRST DOCTOR X723

PATIENT X723
That was a pain medicine.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
That's a pain medicine.

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um which is, it's actually incidentally the same medicine that I would.  It's a different type of pain medicine so you have ibuprofen and tramadol but they're different types of pain medicine and they work differently.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um you know if you get two of the same types of pain medicine you're kind of @@@ use even more than the original.

PATIENT X723
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yeah this is what I would do had you not been on it.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And you've already got a prescription for it; you probably don't have any at home right?

PATIENT X723
No.

FIRST DOCTOR X723

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Okay um you know and you just take it three times a day as needed for pain.  So if you took you know the ibuprofen and one of the tramadol maybe before you go to work.

Which affects heart disease.

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Vascular disease as well as like brain, strokes, puts you at risk for that sort of thing um you want to stay away from foods that are high in salt.

Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You know we've been using salt to preserve food for thousands of years.

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You know and we still use it um so like canned food, food that comes in a box that sort of thing.  Those things tend to have a lot of salt.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
So you know instead of eating like canned vegetables, you know whenever possible try to eat fresh or frozen vegetables.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Things like that.

PATIENT X723
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um you know those are things that you can do with your diet.

PATIENT X723

Um even though you're not too bad you're still not where we want you to be.  You know you're at 143/70 today and we'd like to get you below close to 120 if possible and at very least below 130 you the top number.

PATIENT X723
You mean on the blood pressure how many times a day I'm supposed to take that?

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Take what, measure your blood pressure or take the pills?

PATIENT X723
The pills?

FIRST DOCTOR X723
So.

PATIENT X723
I only take like once a day.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You're on a few different medicines, so the amlodipine.

PATIENT X723
I don't take nothing but once a day all day.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yeah let me just look.  Amlodipine is once a day, Bumex is once a day um lisinopril once a day.  The metoprolol you're supposed to be on twice a day.

PATIENT X723
I only take it once.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Okay.  So yeah, yeah, that may be.

PATIENT X723
So I just have to start taking that twice.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yeah you'll try to come up on the metoprolol.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh, right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
50 mg.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You're supposed to be taking that twice a day you know so I would take it you know, it's supposed to be 12 hours apart.

PATIENT X723
Okay so I'll take it when I.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yeah.

PATIENT X723
When I go to work and while I'm at work.

FIRST DOCTOR X723

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Yeah like right before you go to work.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And right when you get off.

PATIENT X723
Right uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
So maybe that's what we're dealing with.  So yeah let's uh, you know the next time we see you.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
We'll see where your blood pressure's at you know.  Um we won't make any changes.  The only change we'll make is that you'll start taking the metoprolol.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You know twice a day like its prescribed.

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And we'll follow up on it next time.

PATIENT X723
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um other than that, you doing okay? 

PATIENT X723
Good, real good.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Alright now the last thing, we talked about all your labs and your cholesterol looks good.  Um health maintenance um you actually had a colonoscopy this past summer.  Prostate @@@.  You had the flu shot this year.  And then last time I saw you.

PATIENT X723
Yeah you said did I want the flu shot today.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
But you had it, you already had it.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um and then you had the uh the tetanus diphtheria I gave you the last time you were here.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um and have you ever smoked in your life?

PATIENT X723
In the '70s.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Oh okay.  One last thing is uh doing an ultrasound of the abdomen and the reason what they, the recommendations are that any male, any male who smoked.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Should get checked one time at the age of 65.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Should check a one-time ultrasound of the belly.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um and what they're looking up is the aorta, that's the main blood vessel that goes, you know comes out of the heart.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And then goes you know.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Um so people that smoke it puts you at risk for what's called an aneurysm so basically it's a weakness in the wall of the artery.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And it bulges out and then those can rupture and that's you know a very bad thing.

PATIENT X723
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
So they say anyone who smoked at the age 65 they recommend doing a one-time only ultrasound.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Of the belly.

PATIENT X723
I haven't smoked in 20, 30 years.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
They say any smoking history.

PATIENT X723
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
You know just because it's such a, if it does happen it's such a devastating thing.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
And the way you check for it is very, very easy.  They just put a little probe on your belly.

PATIENT X723
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X723
Do you know what I'm talking about, an ultrasound?  It's like the things they do on pregnant women.

PATIENT X723
Yeah I understand, right.

FIRST DOCTOR X723

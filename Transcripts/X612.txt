PATIENT X612
Multivitamin.  I think that's just about everything.

DOCTOR X612
How you doing on your insulin?

PATIENT X612
Uh the insulin I have is just fine.

DOCTOR X612
How much insulin are you actually taking now?  Uh Glargine the long-acting 70 units at night.

PATIENT X612
I cut back on that.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.

PATIENT X612
We're down to 55 on that now.

DOCTOR X612
Okay and then.

PATIENT X612
Cause my sugar was dropping in the middle of the night so we cut back to 55.  On the Aspart.

DOCTOR X612
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X612
The human insulin cut back to 14 units.

DOCTOR X612
With each meal.

PATIENT X612
Uh morning, one in the morning and one at night.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.  How have your blood sugar levels been looking?

PATIENT X612
They been looking, I'm pretty good but like I said.

DOCTOR X612
When you wake up in the morning what is it?

PATIENT X612
Oh.

DOCTOR X612
Oh you have a log okay.  Let's see, yeah I'll take a look at it.

PATIENT X612
Okay @@@, uh this is this week.

DOCTOR X612
Let's see, I see, so this is the time and that's the level?

PATIENT X612
Right.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.  In the 150s and 170s and 115 okay.  And you check it, is this before you take your, is this before you take your evening?

PATIENT X612
Yeah.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.

PATIENT X612
Yeah just before I take my Glargine, take the insulin.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.  Any times where you've gone you know like below 70?

PATIENT X612
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X612
Yes, no, I see a 57 one night there.  What's that?

PATIENT X612
No 41.

DOCTOR X612
Before or after you started cutting back a little bit okay.  Alright.  I see some ones in here that but you started cutting back I see okay, yeah alright.  Did anyone tell you to cut back?

PATIENT X612
Oh they told me before when they first put me on it that if it should start dropping.

DOCTOR X612
Good.  I actually think that's appropriate.  Cause I don't want you, you know when you're 60, 70, that's a little too low.

PATIENT X612
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X612
That's worrisome.  Were you shaking and feeling dizzy or?

PATIENT X612
Uh well it starts in the leg area.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.

PATIENT X612
And they start tingling and then it goes up into the lips and then once it gets in there, then my eyes just seem to blur up the left eye and when that happens.

DOCTOR X612
Yeah.

PATIENT X612
I know what's happening, something's going wrong.

DOCTOR X612
Over the past week how have things been?

PATIENT X612
Uh, this past uh.

DOCTOR X612
Any day.  It doesn't look like you've been low.

PATIENT X612
Sunday I didn't mark it down but Sunday morning it dropped down to 42 at about 3 o'clock in the morning I woke up, used the washroom and I was feeling kind of funny so I decided to take it.  You know when I took it, it was 42.

DOCTOR X612
Alright.

PATIENT X612
It was 42 and uh I took some orange juice, drank some orange juice which was Sunny D and brought it back up.

DOCTOR X612
Is that the only time it's happened like that or is it?

PATIENT X612
Uh this week yeah.

DOCTOR X612
Is it, if you find yourself with blood sugar levels that low, that's pretty concerning.

PATIENT X612
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X612
Um we might need to even go down a little bit more.  Most of your other levels though seems like they're, like 150s, 170s and 110s, that makes it just a one isolated event.

PATIENT X612
Yeah well these uh perhaps when I had a light beer.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.

PATIENT X612
And uh just what I did, I had just @@@ with the family.

DOCTOR X612
Alright well in those situations you might need to you know cut back a little.

PATIENT X612
Yeah.

DOCTOR X612
Cause what you're doing is essentially covering yourself with insulin.

PATIENT X612
Right.

DOCTOR X612
Sugar but if you suddenly don't have enough sugar, uh as much sugar as you normally have then you're giving yourself too much insulin.

PATIENT X612
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X612
But if you think you're gonna you know not eat very much, cut back a little bit.

PATIENT X612
Yeah.

DOCTOR X612
Uh but otherwise I mean on the whole these look pretty good uh.  Yeah and you know do you know what your goals are for the morning?

PATIENT X612
Uh off hand @@@.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.

PATIENT X612
It's fluctuating so much.

DOCTOR X612
I mean ideally you know below 130, 120 in the morning.

PATIENT X612
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X612
But and so you can, every few days you can go up about 2 units to try to get your, with the long-acting.

PATIENT X612
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X612
To get yourself below that, with the caveat that if you're getting those low levels, those 60s, you know below 70s, even in the 60s or lower, something like that, then you've got to be more liberal and you have to give yourself a much bigger range, let yourself go higher.  Cause the going too low, that's more worrisome than having higher, slightly higher okay.

PATIENT X612
Yeah.  So I think uh I think that I'm actually gonna need a new, actually get myself a new meter, this one is not very accurate.  I don't know I tried calibrating it and everything but it still goes up and down so I don't get very good readings.

DOCTOR X612
Oh well let's try to get you a new.  It's the glucometer reading.

PATIENT X612
Right yeah.

DOCTOR X612
Yeah I can certainly do that for you cause, we definitely need to have good readings.

PATIENT X612
Uh-huh.  What should be an ideal blood pressure?

DOCTOR X612
For you, under, below 130/80.

PATIENT X612
So 130 over 80.

DOCTOR X612
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X612
Okay.  I was under the impression it should be in the low 139 and 80.

DOCTOR X612
Well not quite.

PATIENT X612
I was walking from the parking lot.

DOCTOR X612
Yeah.

PATIENT X612
I had @@@.

DOCTOR X612
Okay.

PATIENT X612
Tell me my reading should be.

DOCTOR X612
Well 130/80, that's what you want.

PATIENT X612
130 over 80.  @@@.  And what is it?

DOCTOR X612
Uh between 60 and 90.  Between 60 and 100.  You doing your long-acting in the morning or at night?

PATIENT X612
Uh in the morning.

DOCTOR X612
Good okay.

PATIENT X612
Yeah.

DOCTOR X612
Have you always done it in the morning?

PATIENT X612
Right.

DOCTOR X612
Alright yeah.

PATIENT X612
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X612
That's probably best for you so that you don't bottom out at night.

PATIENT X612
Right.

DOCTOR X612
Alright, I definitely agree with that.

PATIENT X612
Yeah DOCTOR started me on that one a long time ago.

DOCTOR X612
That's fine, so that's good.

PATIENT X612
That's taking more away from, if it's gonna spike, it's gonna spike during the daytime when I'm awake.

DOCTOR X612
Exactly yeah.

PATIENT X612
That's why I started taking it at night but I know what that was from.

DOCTOR X612
Alright, I think I've got most of your medicines up-to-date now.

PATIENT X612
Yeah.

DOCTOR X612
So we're getting them in there.  Okay, okay, okay.  You're still taking nifedipine right?

PATIENT X612
Yeah I needed that.

DOCTOR X612
Okay just wanted to make sure.

PATIENT X612

DOCTOR X612

PATIENT X612
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X612
Alright.  Yeah actually let me put in an order right now to get the glucometer.  

PATIENT X612
And some rubber gloves, latex gloves.

DOCTOR X612
Sure, sure.  Good, alright.  So let's go through some other things here.  So it looks like diabetes I think we've tackled that pretty well.

DOCTOR X612
Uh-huh.

Hmm well it's gotten to the point now where I can walk maybe a block at certain times and then I'll just get tired or I can be coming out of the basement up the stairs, if I go down and put some clothes in the washer or something and if I'm coming up the stairs I'll get out of breath and have to kind of cool myself.

DOCTOR X612

DOCTOR X612
Okay.  How far could you walk at Christmas?

PATIENT X612
Oh I could do three, four blocks before I'd start getting tired.  And I see I've lost about four pounds so at least I'm on the right track.

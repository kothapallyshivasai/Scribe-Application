DOCTOR X696 
PATIENT?

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
Hello.  I'm DOCTOR, I'm glad to meet you.

PATIENT X696
Glad to meet you.

DOCTOR X696
Just have a seat here.

PATIENT X696
Okay.

DOCTOR X696
@@@ a little bit more, sounds like they @@@ today.

PATIENT X696
If I could feel it.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X696
I can feel it on the right hand.

DOCTOR X696
Right there where your leg is, @@@.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
@@@.

PATIENT X696
Okay.  Is there a hangar, a coat rack uh?  Is this @@@ here.

DOCTOR X696
Alright so you asked for me as usual.  Um at that time you were decreasing salt from your diet and you were having some problems with your sleep uh how are you doing now?

PATIENT X696
Okay the sleep is good.  I found out, I found out what the problem was.

DOCTOR X696
What was the problem?

PATIENT X696
I inadvertently would fall asleep on the sofa while watching TV and if I should fall asleep for 20-30 minutes, that would interfere with my sleep cycle.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah.

PATIENT X696
And I wasn't able to sleep fully you see.

DOCTOR X696
Sure.

PATIENT X696
So I guarded against, I mostly guarded against falling asleep for uh you know a week or so and because there was no interruption in the sleep cycle I slept straight through.

DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
Perhaps maybe 6, 8 hours, no problem yet.  Now in regards to the elevated blood pressure.

DOCTOR X696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X696
I've been concerned about it being increased in the last several visits so when I was here in April, I went, I was scheduled to see the nutritionist, which I did.  We had a long talk about diet and such and she gave me a three page document with the do's and don'ts on it.  Foods to eat, foods to avoid etc.

DOCTOR X696
Uh-huh.  Good.

PATIENT X696
Now I've been following that list, not religiously.

DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
But I've been, I'm doing the best I can in following that list.

DOCTOR X696
That's very good.

PATIENT X696
As long as I do all my own cooking, I limit amount of carry outs because it's on kind of the no no’s in them.

DOCTOR X696
Sure.

PATIENT X696
And I eat fruits, vegetables; drink water all the time, fiber, the works you see.  I come here this morning and the blood pressure's elevated again.  Last time she said, the nurse said the blood pressure was 128 over something or other and today the second reading, first reading was 159 and the second reading was 155.

DOCTOR X696
Right.

PATIENT X696
I just don't know what else to do.

DOCTOR X696
Well it might not be anything that you do; it might just be that you need another medicine to help you out okay.  And you know most patients do require more than one after age 60, 65 so that wouldn't be uncalled for.  You're taking lisinopril 40 right now and you don't miss any doses or anything right?

PATIENT X696
Right I take it once a day, in the morning.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah, yeah.  Would you be opposed to starting a new medication to help with your blood pressure and have you come and see us and check your blood pressure and see how that's working.

PATIENT X696
A new one?

DOCTOR X696
Yeah so it'd be one more pill a day but I do think that you're probably gonna need that.

PATIENT X696
Uh uh yeah.  Also one item I heard in the news, uh about a month ago and I haven't had a chance to sit down and research it.  It said something about, it was just a blurb on the news and I know for the full story you have to either read the newspaper, go online, etc., but anyway it said it was a result of a study that said that sodium intake didn't necessarily contribute to high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X696
Right.

PATIENT X696
Now I was waiting for some follow-up, you know some news follow-up that says we know that heart disease has passed cancer as the number one killer in this country.

DOCTOR X696
Right.

PATIENT X696
So you would think that there would have been some kind of follow-up with an important finding like that you see.  But nothing, nothing.  They would put all kind of other nonsense repeatedly on the news.  You'd think something like that would have prominence, wouldn't you think?

DOCTOR X696
You would think yeah.

PATIENT X696
But no it doesn't.  So I was gonna go to Web MD, see what they did on it, I was gonna try to do a Google search to see what they did on it but every time I think about doing that I get a sidetrack on doing something else and I haven't gotten to it and this has been about a month ago.

DOCTOR X696
Hmm.

PATIENT X696
Have you heard anything?

DOCTOR X696
Well I was always taught that you know sodium in patients that already have established hypertension which is known to be idiopathic so they don't know what the etiology is for causing that okay.

PATIENT X696
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X696
If you have that diagnosis, decreasing your salt intake will help your blood pressure.

PATIENT X696
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X696
If you don't have hypertension, increasing your salt intake doesn't cause hypertension, if that makes sense to you.

PATIENT X696
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X696
But in your specific case you have a known diagnosis of high blood pressure, so by decreasing salt it should help your blood pressure.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
Or at least not worsen it.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
We know that way if you have hypertension and you do eat a lot of salt it will worsen it.

PATIENT X696
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X696
Okay but now you're saying you're decreasing the salt and it's not necessarily getting better uh studies don't show that it's necessarily gonna get better, they just show it's not gonna get worse.

PATIENT X696
I get it.

DOCTOR X696
If that makes sense.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
But we don't want it to get worse.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
Now if it's significantly a little bit elevated what that tells me is that your body might need another medication to help control the blood pressure.

PATIENT X696
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X696
That one medication is not doing that.

PATIENT X696
Yeah.

DOCTOR X696
Okay cause that medication is at its max.

PATIENT X696
Because what happened was, as I mentioned, in April the pressure was elevated.

DOCTOR X696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X696
When I came back several days later in June.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah.

PATIENT X696
It was like 128 over some number which was what you wanted to see, you see.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah.

PATIENT X696
Now what over the last six months it has gone up again.  Let me ask you this, um since my pressure is so unstable as it is, what about monitoring at home?

DOCTOR X696
You could.  We could get you a monitor um but how much @@@ do you have after you @@@.

PATIENT X696
Uh none.

DOCTOR X696
@@@ so it might be you have someone at home with you?

PATIENT X696
No.

DOCTOR X696
Someone to check it for you.

PATIENT X696
No.  So it's not audible?

DOCTOR X696
No.

PATIENT X696
Then it wouldn't help that.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah so we could make an appointment to come in to the clinic to get a blood pressure check.  Um let me ask you a few more questions.  So in the past you didn't want a colonoscopy um or screening for prostate cancer.

PATIENT X696
Yeah.

DOCTOR X696
Okay is that the same?

PATIENT X696
That's the same and I'll tell you what.

DOCTOR X696
What about vaccinations?  Are you?

PATIENT X696
Vaccinations for what?

DOCTOR X696
For tetanus, diphtheria, the flu shot, pneumonia.

PATIENT X696
No, not those.  Although, although the pneumonia yes.  DOCTOR, two years ago.

DOCTOR X696
So you've already had that one actually.

PATIENT X696
Yeah she said for all her patients 55 years or older she recommend a pneumonia shot.

DOCTOR X696
Right.

PATIENT X696
And with that I got it.

DOCTOR X696
Good.

PATIENT X696
That's the only inoculation I got.

DOCTOR X696
Okay, that's fine.  So I'll just document that.  

PATIENT X696
Yeah.  Now this colonoscopy, uh I don't do that screening.

DOCTOR X696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X696
And I don't do the PSA as well because if something was found to be abnormal.

DOCTOR X696
You don't want it; yeah we documented that that you wouldn't want any further.

PATIENT X696
Yeah, uh if something's there see I don't want to know if it's abnormal cause the reason I don't want to know is I wouldn't do it, go for the treatment.

DOCTOR X696
I have more questions for you.  Do you smoke or did you smoke in the past?

PATIENT X696
Uh I smoked in the past but oh it's been years since I've stopped.

DOCTOR X696
Okay.  So the main thing we need um to pull it back together @@@ have you been urinating okay?

PATIENT X696
Oh yes.  

DOCTOR X696
Do you have a lot of allergies to things?  No?

PATIENT X696
Uh no because I uh I take this uh, this allergy medication every day.

DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
Uh what is it 25 mg xxxadryl.

DOCTOR X696
Verapamil, you take 10 mg of verapamil.

PATIENT X696
Well actually see I stopped taking that.

DOCTOR X696
Oh you did.

PATIENT X696
Yeah and I just uh.

DOCTOR X696
Took xxxadryl?

PATIENT X696
I just take xxxadryl.

DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
Once a day.

DOCTOR X696
Okay and that controls it?

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
Do you need refills on anything?

PATIENT X696
Uh the I'm sure the statin uh it's the what is it simvastatin.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah.

PATIENT X696
And also the pressure medication lisinopril now you said you might want to add.

DOCTOR X696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X696
Another.  

DOCTOR X696
Yeah we'll talk to DOCTOR about it.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

DOCTOR X696
Okay let me go get her and check your heart and lungs really quickly.

PATIENT X696
Okay.

DOCTOR X696
Deep breath.  Again.  Do you have swelling in your legs at all?

PATIENT X696
Uh no.

DOCTOR X696
Okay that's good.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

PATIENT X696
Okay and we're gonna ask about a blood test?

DOCTOR X696
Yeah.

PATIENT X696
The lab work that measures the cholesterol.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah you haven't eaten today right?

PATIENT X696
No I didn't.  Personally, every December we do the blood.

DOCTOR X696
Okay yeah, so we'll get it today then.

PATIENT X696
Yeah and I purposefully don't eat @@@.

DOCTOR X696
You know the rules.

PATIENT X696
Yeah.

DOCTOR X696
Good.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  30:50  DOCTOR IN:  33:28)

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Hey PATIENT.

PATIENT X696
DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
How are you?

PATIENT X696
I feel good thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
You look good.  So you are all settled in your new place?

PATIENT X696
Beg your pardon?

SECOND DOCTOR X696
You are settled in that new apartment you were trying to move into last time we saw you?

PATIENT X696
Uh yes I'm settled.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
Uh yes uh so now I'm trying to stay healthy.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
But it's hard.  It's hard.  You know this blood pressure evidently; I don't know what to do.  You know when I was here before you increased the lisinopril from 20 to 40.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Oh.

PATIENT X696
Now and as a result of doing that I came back 30 days later, you checked the pressure and it was 128.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
Just what you wanted to see.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Are you checking it at home?

FIRST DOCTOR X696
@@@.

PATIENT X696
There's no way I could check it at home because.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
I wonder if they have like anything @@@.

PATIENT X696
Yeah that's what I would need, something that would talk.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
But I don't know that we have it but I can put in the request and see what they have.

PATIENT X696
Yes okay.  But see when I was here uh in April I was so concerned about the salty things.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
You are watching your diet right?

PATIENT X696
Absolutely.  When I was here in April I talked to the dietician.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Okay alright.  So in that case, two ways we can do, we um, A we can go ahead and start you on a new medication today; B we can have you come back with another visit with the nurse, to see if it's still elevated then we can start at that point so since we didn't have any readings in between but that's what we can do.  Which one do you prefer?

PATIENT X696
Well with no change in medications starting today I'm sure it's gonna be the same results.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
That's right.  So you would go ahead and start the new medication right now then?

PATIENT X696
Would it be a new on or an addition to?

SECOND DOCTOR X696
That's correct because you are already on the maximum dose on the one that you are taking.

PATIENT X696
I see.  Yeah, yeah okay.  Oh the new one yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
You know I'm just.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Were you ever on a water pill before?

PATIENT X696
Uh yes, zestoretic is that a drug? 

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X696
Is that the chemical for zestoretic?

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Dyazide, no I don't know about that.

PATIENT X696
Uh I'm not sure of the chemical but before I came, before I was coming to the VA, the zestoretic I believe had a water component to it.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Alright so we'll go ahead and do that, half a dose only, very small dose.

PATIENT X696
Tell me which one?

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Water pill.

PATIENT X696
The water pill.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Yeah and then we'll have your blood pressure checked in one month with the pharmacist uh and at that time we'll see.

PATIENT X696
No you said, now this will be what would be a combination of the anti-hypertensive plus a water pill combined?

SECOND DOCTOR X696
No you're not on combination only on tablet of medication.  The lisinopril is by itself.

PATIENT X696
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
So this is in addition to those meds okay.

PATIENT X696
Oh so you take it with the.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
The lisinopril and you take an additional medicine because one medicine is not controlling your blood pressure.

PATIENT X696
Is that that water pill?

SECOND DOCTOR X696
That's correct hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X696
I see, I see.  Okay one item, I've been reading about this chemical probiotics.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
No you don't need it.

PATIENT X696
Don't need it.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Oh probiotics are when you're on long term antibiotics or you're in the hospital, you're on big time antibiotics, no you don't need them.

PATIENT X696
I see yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X696
Alright.

PATIENT X696
Okay thank you.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
You want to pick this up at the window?

PATIENT X696
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the lab work.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Yeah I already ordered it; you can just go get it now.

PATIENT X696
Oh, oh, okay now you said here about the medicine, I'll pick it up.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Or we could send it in the mail.

PATIENT X696
I'd rather pick it up.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Yeah okay let me put it in, that's a lower one.

PATIENT X696
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Alright you can pick it up at the window okay.

PATIENT X696
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
And then you can go to the Lab @@@ okay.

PATIENT X696
Okay um.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
You're all set.

PATIENT X696
Um.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
We'll have you check in with the Pharmacy in one month okay.

PATIENT X696
Okay can I ask you something?  Take a look at this; I'm feeling here and here.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Good.

PATIENT X696
A rash.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Nope there's no rash.

PATIENT X696
Because it was here, here on my.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
I think it's just dry on this one side.

PATIENT X696
Dry.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
You can just maybe moisturize it.

PATIENT X696
I should.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X696
I should.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Let me you walk out here and then um you'll need to get some @@@ for it to help you get into the Lab or.

PATIENT X696
I guess the uh people from uh, what is the department that it is uh, it's the Escort.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Okay let's go get one.

PATIENT X696
Okay so again uh just the water pill.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
You take the water pill once a day okay and um you pick it up at the window and then I refilled your lisinopril and you can pick that up at the window.

PATIENT X696
Okay now, now the name of that again that water?

FIRST DOCTOR X696
It's called hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X696
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
It's a diuretic so it will make you go to the bathroom more okay.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
So we can cut it, that would be for your blood pressure okay.

PATIENT X696
I see.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
And we think that this one will help so we have you on a smaller dose of it, we might need to increase it but that's how we do it, we start at a smaller dose and then we increase it okay.

PATIENT X696
I see, I see.

DOCTOR X696
Okay I'll take you out to the window so you want to grab my arm?

PATIENT X696
Uh yes.  Okay.  Yeah I need to come in for the lab work but it's not a big deal right?

FIRST DOCTOR X696
So.

PATIENT X696
Because I wanted the results and you'll let me know @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Okay @@@ ask DOCTOR but you'll be back @@@.

PATIENT X696
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Um so if @@@ then I'll just call you back and @@@.  But you can always give her a call um if you needed the results and also they can send you a letter to let you know @@@.

PATIENT X696
I get it.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Okay.

PATIENT X696
Can I get it in a letter?

FIRST DOCTOR X696
No problem, I will do that for you.

PATIENT X696
See the letter; does it give all the details?

FIRST DOCTOR X696
It will tell you if they're normal, abnormal or @@@ and if you want an actual copy of it @@@ if that makes sense.

PATIENT X696
What you say, what are you gonna measure and give it to me in the letter.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
It tells you kind of like your blood counts are normal or your blood count was abnormal and your hemoglobin was low like that.  That's what the letter does, it's like a quick.

PATIENT X696
Okay now what about.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
It can identify what has happened.

PATIENT X696
Now first of all.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
We can send that in the form of a letter no problem.

PATIENT X696
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
I'm gonna get you; there's a line to wait in.

PATIENT X696
Uh yes uh.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
@@@.

PATIENT X696
So what do I do uh, how do I pay for this on a credit card?  Do I do it now?

FIRST DOCTOR X696
Yeah they do it @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT X696
Okay.  But I can't wait @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
You can always call and get it @@@.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X696

PATIENT X696
So what do they order on the labs?

FIRST DOCTOR X696
I'm ordering everything, your blood counts, cholesterol, @@@ everything.

PATIENT X696
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
You'll get your labs drawn okay.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
You'll have to wait in line so just tell them, ask the clerk you can give her this.

PATIENT X696
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X696
That you need a parking ticket and you'll probably need an escort @@@.

PATIENT X696
Yes, yes and you'll put in a request so @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X696

PATIENT X696
Okay thank you.

FIRST DOCTOR X696

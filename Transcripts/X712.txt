PATIENT X712
Oh yeah right.

DOCTOR X712
So you need uh, let's see the last time the metformin so you're taking that in the morning then.  So um are you checking your finger stick glucoses in the home?

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
For your, with the diabetes.  You're taking the metformin for the diabetes.

You're not checking your sugars?

PATIENT X712
Oh no.

DOCTOR X712
Oh okay.

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
And it looks like your diabetes is a little worse.

PATIENT X712
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
You know I took, I signed up for the test, how'd I do.

DOCTOR X712
It looks like you have uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea.

PATIENT X712
Good.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Cause they came back and said I @@@, cause that's the worst diagnosis in the world.  I got every symptom @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah.  At one point you uh they want to set you up with a machine so I mean you're gonna have to do that.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
They probably want you on a CPAP.

PATIENT X712
That's @@@ oxygen.

DOCTOR X712
It doesn't, I don't think that you needed oxygen uh intermittently to provide pressure.

PATIENT X712
Yeah, yeah I @@@ that.

DOCTOR X712
CPAP.  Have you ever used it before?

PATIENT X712
No.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
Oh so you talked to DOCTOR @@@.  So you're gonna see DOCTOR on the 22nd of this month.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
That's when they'll set you up with that.

PATIENT X712
That's weird.  A psychiatrist can set you up with a breathing machine.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah she's my psychiatrist.

DOCTOR X712
Oh yeah she can put that in.

PATIENT X712
No she had @@@.

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712
That @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.

PATIENT X712
She got me started in Pulmonary.

DOCTOR X712
Alright so you're gonna need a Pulmonary follow-up appointment.

PATIENT X712
@@@ doctor she can set that up.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah, we can set it up for you.

PATIENT X712
The last time @@@.

DOCTOR X712
What's that?

PATIENT X712
The last time you saw me you were supposed to have the meds so then @@@ on the machine, uh the cell phone and then they said it wasn't ordered then.

DOCTOR X712
And what wasn't ordered @@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
Oh we yeah we.

PATIENT X712
So I don't know if you forgot to put it all in or what but it really screwed me up because then I had to go through hell to find a doctor or a pharmacist or somebody, finally got back to me and so @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Okay, so we're talking about your pump.

PATIENT X712
That order @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Okay you wanted morphine?

PATIENT X712
Yeah, all the medications should be in there.

DOCTOR X712
Okay so I'll put in the albuterol.  Have you been out of these?

PATIENT X712
The albuterol I was and I called them and they said I needed to talk to the doctor.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.

PATIENT X712
They tell you one thing when you're on the phone and then you call up the Pharmacy oh no you can get it.

DOCTOR X712
Sorry about that.

PATIENT X712
That's alright.

DOCTOR X712
And you're on the mometasone.

PATIENT X712
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X712
You're on the formoterol and the albuterol.  Is there anything else that you're taking?

PATIENT X712
@@@.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.  @@@ turn and it disperses the powder automatically every time you open it.

DOCTOR X712
Right.

PATIENT X712
So I have to pierce that capsule, @@@ out of the other one.  And I think they tried to combine the albuterol.

DOCTOR X712
The Combivent has albuterol in it.

PATIENT X712
Oh that's it.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah.  So really I'm sorry that you needed to go without it.

PATIENT X712
Oh you know I need @@@.  When I climb the stairs, I'm on the second floor and it's got a third floor @@@, I got to rest halfway up and sit down on the stairs.  There's no I can get one of those walkers @@@ is there?

DOCTOR X712
Um that's possible I think.  Do you feel like you need that?

PATIENT X712
Well.

DOCTOR X712
Do you get shortness of breath?

PATIENT X712
No just like I said shortness of breath is one thing.  I get out of breath about a half a block to a block but it's the reason for the @@@, I take a lot of @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah.

PATIENT X712
See a lot of time @@@ but I'll stay on my feet for 40 to 30 minutes and I'm tired @@@ that.

DOCTOR X712
Hmm.  Are you taking Tylenol for your pain?  Does that help?

Okay I'll renew that.

PATIENT X712

PATIENT X712
Yeah it helps.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.

PATIENT X712
They gave me something for the itching I'd never heard of @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X712
But then he gave me this pink stuff @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Calamine?

PATIENT X712
Yeah that's it.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
Okay do you @@@.

PATIENT X712
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712
They tried to stop having me smoking right.

DOCTOR X712

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712
Yeah.  I just got over @@@ from that.  @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
Okay.  Have you been having episodes of chest pain?

PATIENT X712
Uh only when I'm out of breath @@@ you know something @@@.

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X712
Okay.

DOCTOR X712
Um.

PATIENT X712
Because @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Right we could give you the 500.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
And @@@ at home.

PATIENT X712
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X712
@@@ in the machine.

PATIENT X712
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah, right I see.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah definitely we need to have you um start doing that.  I'm not sure you haven't done it before.

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
There is.

PATIENT X712
Is there?

DOCTOR X712
Yeah there is.

PATIENT X712
Oh cause that's what I was told @@@.

DOCTOR X712
But now you're at the point where you're definitely diabetic.

PATIENT X712
Oh yeah, yeah.  @@@.  They never did tell me to take any kind of blood tests @@@ I don't know.  But they were treating me with medicines.

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712
What's that?

DOCTOR X712
The vaccine for @@@.

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
The last time you had it was in 2000 @@@.

PATIENT X712
Oh okay.  Maybe if she'd have told me that, that I should get it.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah she can give it to you today.

PATIENT X712
Good.  @@@.

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X712
@@@ with that.

PATIENT X712
Not yet.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.  

PATIENT X712
Why are my legs all puffed up?

DOCTOR X712
Um it's probably from, have you ever had any swelling in your legs?  @@@.

PATIENT X712
Uh a couple of days.

DOCTOR X712
Let's see if @@@.  It could be two different reasons.  It could be from your kidneys or @@@.

PATIENT X712
Sure.

DOCTOR X712
Um it could be from, it also could be from your heart if you have longstanding problems like diabetes and hypertension it can cause swelling in your legs, also the shortness of breath.  And the reason @@@ smoking @@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah I've been smoking a pipe ever since @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Oh okay but still, it still um could be from that or it could be from the lungs or it could be from the heart.

PATIENT X712
I see.

DOCTOR X712
I could give you something for the swelling.

PATIENT X712
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.  So let me see when the last time you had @@@.

PATIENT X712
Right.

DOCTOR X712
And see if @@@.

PATIENT X712
And @@@ that would be great.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah.

PATIENT X712

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712

PATIENT X712

DOCTOR X712
How are you going to lose weight then?

PATIENT X712
I don't know.

DOCTOR X712
Open your mouth, say ah.

PATIENT X712
Ah.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.  

PATIENT X712
I know when my legs swell; I'm real tender in the stomach here.

DOCTOR X712
Really.

PATIENT X712
Yeah you push down and it hurts.

DOCTOR X712
Are you @@@?

PATIENT X712
Uh I don't do that.  @@@.  

DOCTOR X712
Really.  Take some deep breaths.  Again.  Your lungs sound pretty good.

PATIENT X712
Yeah they do @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah.

PATIENT X712
Usually I wheeze.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.  Let me see when the last time you had @@@.

PATIENT X712
Right.

DOCTOR X712
It's probably been @@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah, at least a year I think.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
I know.  @@@ the heart @@@ heart rate was 50 @@@ oh yeah.  I truly @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Hmm.  Your EKG looked good back then.

PATIENT X712
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X712
Alright let me go talk to my boss.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X712
Who's your boss?

DOCTOR X712
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X712
DOCTOR oh.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Very impressive.  @@@.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Laughs.

DOCTOR X712
I'll be right back.

PATIENT X712
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  62:28  DOCTOR IN:  72:38)

DOCTOR X712
Do you want to know the verdict? 

PATIENT X712
Alright doctor.

DOCTOR X712
Well um I took a look at some of your cardiac studies, to try to see the performance.

PATIENT X712
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X712
We pulled it up and your echo looked okay.  I don't think, it's very unlikely to be coming from your heart.

PATIENT X712
Okay.

DOCTOR X712
Um it's probably from your combined asthma/obstructive sleep apnea. 

PATIENT X712
Okay.

DOCTOR X712
The blood pressures in the pulmonary arteries that are in the lungs are pretty high.

PATIENT X712
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X712
And that makes me think it's coming from here.

PATIENT X712
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X712
So I think with the CPAP uh that should help you.

PATIENT X712
Sounds good.

DOCTOR X712
But we can definitely, we're gonna start you on medication to help with the swelling in your legs.

PATIENT X712
@@@.

DOCTOR X712
Um and we also want to go up on your diabetes meds.

PATIENT X712
Okay.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Did you ask her about that little chair?

DOCTOR X712
Yeah we'll definitely look into that.

PATIENT X712
Great, terrific.

DOCTOR X712
Um.

PATIENT X712
It'll help me out in three different ways.

DOCTOR X712
You have to come back though for some blood work on this medication to help you pee and for the swelling because it can mess up your potassium and electrolytes and stuff.

PATIENT X712
Okay yeah you gotta keep track of that.

DOCTOR X712
We just have to follow it yeah.  Let's see here so.

PATIENT X712
Want a piece of candy?

DOCTOR X712
Oh no thanks I already had, I already ate.  I'm a diabetic too so.

PATIENT X712
Are you really?

DOCTOR X712
Yeah.

PATIENT X712
So you do that blood test and all the time too.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah I check my finger sticks three or four times a day.

PATIENT X712
Alright.

DOCTOR X712
So we're going up on the metformin.  So now you were taking 500 twice a day of the metformin for your diabetes.  Now you're gonna be taking twice that.  You're taking 1000.

PATIENT X712
Okay.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.  And let's see we are also going to start you on something called Lasix flushing the kidneys.  It helps to basically increase the amount of urine.

PATIENT X712
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X712
It basically ups the urine.

PATIENT X712
I pee all the time anyway.

DOCTOR X712
I know but that might be because of the diabetes so if you get the blood sugars down then you might not pee as much.

PATIENT X712
Alright, alright.

DOCTOR X712
Now you pee you'll actually.

PATIENT X712
Get @@@.

DOCTOR X712
Be less sugar @@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X712
So um but along with the pee, is it also @@@ potassium.

PATIENT X712
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X712
Magnesium, stuff like that can get low.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
Check your levels a little bit.  We'll start with um, I think we're gonna start with 40 mg twice a day.  This stuff works in six hours, so when you take it you have to put your legs up and then all that water will be resorbed into your body and @@@.

PATIENT X712
I @@@.

DOCTOR X712
It @@@.

PATIENT X712
I do that now, I elevate my legs as much as possible and I don't think it helps.  

DOCTOR X712
Can you give us a urine test today too?

PATIENT X712
Sure.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.

PATIENT X712
I'm a giving guy.

DOCTOR X712
Great.

PATIENT X712
How many gallons do they want?

DOCTOR X712
Enough to @@@ I guess.  Um let's see here, a couple of the labs now.  You should come back in probably about two weeks to get your blood tests checked.

PATIENT X712
Okay.

DOCTOR X712
Then I'll follow up everything you know just to make sure.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
If something's abnormal.

PATIENT X712
And what about the compression stockings?

DOCTOR X712
Yeah I'll order them now.  @@@ takes a little bit of time.  I'll give you a call and let you know if they're in.

PATIENT X712
Oh they've got them up there all the time?

DOCTOR X712
They, if you go up there immediately yeah.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
I'll put in the order.

PATIENT X712
If it's in the computer they got them.  If it ain't in the computer they don't have it.

DOCTOR X712
Let's see here and one of the notes has the size in there so then we can get the size @@@.

PATIENT X712
I think it's like the second from the top.  Yeah I get these shooting pains all the way down to my toes right now.

DOCTOR X712
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X712
Yeah in my legs and my toes.  

DOCTOR X712
It's probably @@@.

PATIENT X712
Yeah.

DOCTOR X712
@@@.  

PATIENT X712
Sure would help me out.  

DOCTOR X712
Are you gonna pick it up or how will we get it to you?

PATIENT X712
Well it would be coming from Prosthetics.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah.

PATIENT X712
Yeah I'd go up and get it.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.  Okay so we're gonna have you see the nurse and in two weeks um.

PATIENT X712
This stuff shows in the print-out, oh yes.

DOCTOR X712
Yeah well they'll, I think they @@@ and then they'll give you something to take home to remind you.

PATIENT X712
Alright.

DOCTOR X712
And then also I'll send you a letter when you're gonna see me next as well.

PATIENT X712
Okay.

DOCTOR X712
Okay.  So.

PATIENT X712
Well I don't, I'll probably hear now.

DOCTOR X712
No keep that.

PATIENT X712
Oh for what?  Keep that?

DOCTOR X712
No you give that back to them.

PATIENT X712
Oh that's right.  Do I just go to the nurse now and get it?

DOCTOR X712
Yeah I think you, oh the pulmonary function; I'll put that in there now.

PATIENT X712
You want it right now?

DOCTOR X712

Mother and father were how come you don't go out so I'm trying to kick this drinking habit.

PATIENT X719
That's why I came in here you know.  Instead of going to Alcoholics Anonymous I'm gonna kick it myself without help and they say okay take your time you know.  When you get over it, get over it and.

DOCTOR X719
Are you over it?

PATIENT X719
Yeah I walk by liquor stores.  You know my father he drinks and uh he can't even get me to have a drink with him.  The last drink I had was New Years and it was a can of beer, took me over an hour to drink it so.  That much cause I was reading in this book uh @@@ that I got from the VA Hospital in xxx and a lot of the symptoms in that book I observe it like uh the tiredness all the time and the lack of sleep and uh the @@@ but it's hard for me to think.  So I'm going through a VA program right now to help veterans get jobs and support them and stuff and uh I got to stop and think, you see what I'm saying.  The book talks about brain @@@ and not having enough energy cause I'm older now and I just, I'm turning 53 next week and it's saying that maybe starting supplements like @@@ and CT10.

DOCTOR X719
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X719
Could help get rid of that and @@@.  I got the book with me and it's a lot of stuff in the book I was gonna talk to the doctor and see if I can get some of that.  Is that a possibility?

PATIENT X719
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X719
I mean there's a couple of things, I can put in a prescription for a multivitamin but like CT10 I know we don't have.

PATIENT X719
Okay you know @@@ to @@@.

DOCTOR X719
The only vitamins that the VA offers are vitamin D, folic acid, B12 um, ergocalciferol um well it's basically a multivitamin which has you know a bunch of different vitamins in it you know like your basic stuff vitamin C, A, you know those types of things.  Uh but CT10 and I'm not sure what the other one is.

PATIENT X719
Uh-huh.  @@@ that I'm talking about.  I can show you the book.

DOCTOR X719
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X719

DOCTOR X719
Yeah we got to get that blood pressure down.

PATIENT X719

DOCTOR X719
Alright.  

PATIENT X719

DOCTOR X719

PATIENT X719
There's been times, like the last two weeks I've been setting my alarm to get up at 6:30 cause I have to be at this program I'm in and I got to be there at 9 o'clock.

DOCTOR X719
No drug use?

PATIENT X719
No drug use.  I stopped @@@.

DOCTOR X719
@@@.  Other things that can affect your sleep, depression.

PATIENT X719
Yeah I know I'm, I'm depressed right now cause I'm looking for work and uh going on interviews and so far nothing.  Personally I mean it's like, still every day I have to push myself to get out of bed.  You know I'm always tired all the damn time.

DOCTOR X719
Do you have another appointment for Psychiatry?

PATIENT X719
That what I said I did and I didn't, last time I was here to see the doctor I got here too late but the guy you set it up and I didn't make it.

DOCTOR X719
Okay.  Well call back and set that up okay.  Cause if you know I want to help you with the sleep.

PATIENT X719
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X719
But I want you know if the sleep, you're not gonna sleep because of depression which is extremely common, okay and that's extremely common then we need to deal with the depression.  I don't want to give you sleeping pills and you know because sleeping pills, sleeping pills are like you know honestly one of the last things that I like to give people because it's a band-aid many times.  It's not, you know it's like what I mean by that is we're not getting to the root of the problem.  As soon as you stop taking the sleeping pills you're gonna have trouble with sleep again if we don't get to the why you're not getting good sleep.  If it's depression then we should treat the depression.

PATIENT X719
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X719
Because sleeping pills aren't gonna do anything for the depression.

PATIENT X719
Oh.

DOCTOR X719
If I give you sleeping pills, you might, I might as well say well you're gonna be on these pills for the rest of your life.

PATIENT X719
Oh okay, I just thought it was the other way around you know.

DOCTOR X719
No, no, no.

PATIENT X719
If you.

DOCTOR X719
You know I mean, I don't know but I think it's very possible that your sleeping is you know it's probably your difficulty sleeping is secondary to depression.

PATIENT X719
Okay.

DOCTOR X719
You know I mean you've got good sleep habits.  You go to bed at the same time, you don't have a TV.

PATIENT X719
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X719
Uh you don't drink like coffee before you go to bed.

PATIENT X719
No, no.

DOCTOR X719
You don't have caffeine.

PATIENT X719
When I get up in the morning.

DOCTOR X719
Yeah but not, you know, not before bed so those are kind of the simple things that we can do um you know.  There are others, there is a long list of reasons as to why people don't get to sleep but you know depression is a very, very, we see this all the time.  You know it's actually more common to see someone with depression who has problems with sleep than someone who doesn't and then we see people who sleep too much.

PATIENT X719
Okay.

DOCTOR X719
Cause they're always tired.

PATIENT X719
Right.

DOCTOR X719
So I mean you know I don't mind giving you something for sleeping pills but I want you to be on the same page with me that.

PATIENT X719
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X719
This is not gonna be a permanent thing.  I don't want to keep giving you sleeping pills; you know what I'm saying?

PATIENT X719
Yeah I'm, yeah okay.  Work off of it and go see the doctor.

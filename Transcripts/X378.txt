If @@@ is low its okay?

DOCTOR X378
Yeah.  I mean he isn't getting over like you know every day you're down.  Like I tell some of my patients like every day that you were in the hospital that will take about 4-5 days per one of those days for you to get better and you're kind of prolonged to.

Yeah.

DOCTOR X378
I don't think you were just over it the four days that you're in the hospital.

DOCTOR X33
How you doing?

PATIENT X33
Alright.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Alrighty.  Okay so, you're seeing the eye doctor today, is that right?

PATIENT X33
Yeah.

DOCTOR X33
Which eye is it that's painful?

PATIENT X33
The left.

DOCTOR X33
They said you got an infection in there huh?

PATIENT X33
@@@ shingles.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah, it's like a viral infection.

PATIENT X33
Yes.

DOCTOR X33
Okay uh.  How long has it been like that for?

PATIENT X33
Saturday.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Any around you been sick or anything else like that?

PATIENT X33
Pardon?

DOCTOR X33
Any sick contacts, anybody around you has been sick or?

PATIENT X33
No.

DOCTOR X33
Maybe it's just the shingles reactivation.

PATIENT X33
Yeah.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Ever had shingles anywhere else before?

PATIENT X33
No.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Uh any problems with vision in that eye?

PATIENT X33
Well no I can still see with it but it's painful.

DOCTOR X33
Very painful.  Does the light make it more painful?

PATIENT X33
Huh?

DOCTOR X33
Does the light hurt it?

PATIENT X33
Not really.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  @@@

PATIENT X33
No.

DOCTOR X33
How's your breathing?

PATIENT X33
Okay I guess.

DOCTOR X33
Any coughing, fevers, chills?

PATIENT X33
No.

DOCTOR X33
Um any worsening in leg swelling or weight gain?

PATIENT X33
No.

DOCTOR X33
Alright.  No chest pains recently.

PATIENT X33
Not really.

DOCTOR X33
Uh are moving back to your son's again?

PATIENT X33
No I'm on my own now.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Where do you live?

PATIENT X33
In my own home.  

DOCTOR X33
In xxx xxx, is that where you're still living?

PATIENT X33
xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Okay so.

PATIENT X33
What kind of pain medicine would you use for the shingles?

DOCTOR X33
Uh the same pain medication used for anything else really.  There's nothing specific for that.  You think you need pain medicine?

PATIENT X33
Yeah, which ones can you give?

DOCTOR X33
Have you tried anything?

PATIENT X33
Yeah Tylenol but I've been @@@ all the time, all day yesterday, here in the hospital today I spent a long time.

DOCTOR X33
So your weight is up from where we last had it.  Last month.  It went from 188 to 195.

PATIENT X33
Hmm well I'm fluctuating around the 190 mark.

DOCTOR X33
You watching your diet with the salt and everything.

PATIENT X33
Oh sure.

DOCTOR X33
Okay and the fluids?

PATIENT X33
Yes.

DOCTOR X33
Any diarrhea coming back?

PATIENT X33
Uh, well it has nothing to do with @@@.  It's just regular diarrhea.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.

PATIENT X33
Yesterday and that's cleared up but I, what is the stuff they use for diarrhea when they have it, what's the medicine?  It's over-the-counter I think.

DOCTOR X33
Oh loperamide is the generic name but it's called, it's normally called Lomotil.  I think it was a brand name that you buy, Imodium, is that what you're talking about?

PATIENT X33
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

DOCTOR X33
@@@ if you're worried about C. diff.

PATIENT X33
What.

DOCTOR X33
That Imodium.

PATIENT X33
Oh.  I had C. diff four times this year.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah I know.  I would not recommend that medicine for you.

PATIENT X33
I wouldn't take it then.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Because with having the diabetes, you get the toxins out, they build up and especially with the C. diff you have a very large increase in your colon where it gets bigger in size and they could explode and that's inappropriate based on that.

PATIENT X33
Okay.

DOCTOR X33
Well how's your activity levels?

PATIENT X33
Oh I try to move but I can barely move around I mean, I just sit.  I waddle like a duck when I'm off the scooter.

DOCTOR X33
You finished cardiac rehab after your bypass right, a year ago?

PATIENT X33
Cardiac, what do you mean cardiac?

DOCTOR X33
You had rehab after your bypass?

PATIENT X33
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X33
And then you were at the nursing home where you were getting rehab.

PATIENT X33
Yeah, yeah and I spent Tuesday in PCC1B.

DOCTOR X33
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X33
And Wednesday on the 15th floor and also a short stay, I don't know what floor it was, for just a few days and that was reacting to diarrhea and at the time, then the C. diff though.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Um you're not getting any therapy right now?

PATIENT X33
I had a therapist coming in and uh I don't know what her name is, she used to come over to my son's house and I moved out of his house last wee and I had a nurse, a real Polish nurse, a nice one, NURSE something or other.  I don't have help, but my kids' got all the phone numbers and I wanted to contact both of them.

DOCTOR X33
Was that through the VA or who?

PATIENT X33
Yes.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.

PATIENT X33
I don't know who they are.

DOCTOR X33
Think it's somebody in therapy?

PATIENT X33
Well, yes sure.

DOCTOR X33
I don't think so uh, okay.

PATIENT X33
How do I get hold of the therapist and the one that's been seeing me?

DOCTOR X33
I don't know about the one that's seeing you.

PATIENT X33
Alright.

DOCTOR X33
Um I can put an order in to get a therapist.  You can always try calling your son and have your son call them and you now we need an order and I'll put an order for therapy.

PATIENT X33
Okay but what about the nurse?  She's been checking my vitals.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah a home nurse.

PATIENT X33
Yeah.  I'll be concerned about seeing her; she's a very good nurse.  She was coming in Friday to see me and then last Friday I missed her.  The therapist was coming in on Saturday and I missed her.

DOCTOR X33
You there's a program here called Home-Based Primary Care.

PATIENT X33
Yeah.

DOCTOR X33
And what it means is a doctor comes out to visit you at your house every so often instead of you coming here to xxx um and also nurses come out and visit you every so often.

PATIENT X33
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X33
Um, they basically become your primary care doctor but I'm wondering since you really are liking the fact that these people are coming to your house and checking up on you and that type of thing.

PATIENT X33
Okay.

DOCTOR X33
Is this something you would be interested in?

PATIENT X33
Yes.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Let me talk to people and see what it takes to get you in the program there.

PATIENT X33
Sure.

DOCTOR X33
Cause it almost sounds like, you know, it's the type of thing, you @@@ accepted this, sounds like they keep a close eye on you at home and uh and it may help that way.  Okay, do you need your meds refilled I assume?

PATIENT X33
Yeah.  They'll have them going down to the Pharmacy but I won't be able to get all that filled today unless you have some other medication for me.  That you can have mailed to me.

DOCTOR X33
Okay, yeah we'll mail those up to you.

PATIENT X33
Yeah.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Let me take a listen to you.  Just stay right there.  @@@ alright.  Big breath in now.

PATIENT X33
There's a crackling in the right lung I guess uh, I think its scar tissue and uh uh, I had four CAT scans plus a CT scan.

DOCTOR X33
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X33
And it wasn't getting any worse.  The first one was seen and then the three after that were not getting worse so they weren't concerned about that.  But the scar tissue was there.

DOCTOR X33
From a former pneumonia?

PATIENT X33
Yeah.

DOCTOR X33
So you've seen a pulmonologist it looks like.  They want you to get another x-ray of your chest is that right?

PATIENT X33
When?

DOCTOR X33
You can come up here next month.

PATIENT X33
Will they send me an appointment?

DOCTOR X33
Uh we can get one set-up.

PATIENT X33
Well about, you know last year I asked you, this is last year, I asked you about my triglycerides.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah.

PATIENT X33
They were high.  I don't think you were concerned about that because uh nothing was done but in November I had to have open heart surgery and quadruple bypass.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah.  So are you concerned it was the triglyceride and I didn't listen to that?

PATIENT X33
I don't know, I can say that.

DOCTOR X33
Uh, it probably wasn't.  Um, you have diabetes right.

PATIENT X33
How can you check the diabetes?

DOCTOR X33
Oh there's way to do these.  @@@.  Um triglycerides are not even really, they are a very minor risk factor for heart disease.

PATIENT X33
Well it was 300 all that time; it said 300, 300, 300.

DOCTOR X33
@@@ last time we had @@@.

PATIENT X33
I did when was that?

DOCTOR X33
That was back this past summer in June.  Prior to that.

PATIENT X33
Well that's when I was hospitalized in 1B.

DOCTOR X33
Prior to that it was 192 and that was back in February.

PATIENT X33
And prior to that it was 300.  Cause it was controlled back then I guess.

DOCTOR X33
Yes.

PATIENT X33
With the diet and everything.

DOCTOR X33
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X33
And it was eight months before.

DOCTOR X33
And your other cholesterol panel was fine, so I think that, you know um, taking all that together, you don't want to go @@@ and you are on a couple of medications for that.

PATIENT X33
Really.

DOCTOR X33
Uh, @@@ and all that stuff okay.  Yeah I don't know if I'll change that.  I want to recheck the cholesterol panel the next visit.

PATIENT X33
Oh Zocor, they put me on a half and you had me on the full tablet.

DOCTOR X33
Who switched it?

PATIENT X33
I don't know.  Listen when I got out of the 15th floor in the main building.

DOCTOR X33
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X33
There was uh a nurse over there that screwed up on six of my medications and I called DOCTOR and DOCTOR called her and boy she really moved and she called my son at the time when I was staying with him and she apologized for those goof ups.  There were medical increases that the doctors gave me while I was in the hospital there and there were, I don't know what changes they were but anyway it amounted to six of them and that wasn't too good for a nurse practitioner.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah.  Let's um, let's recheck your cholesterol and see how it's been on the dose that you've been taking.

PATIENT X33
Okay.

DOCTOR X33
And then we can make changes based on that.

PATIENT X33
As long as I'm staying with the 5 mg.

DOCTOR X33
You're taking 10; you're taking half of a 20.

PATIENT X33
Yeah.

DOCTOR X33
Okay?

PATIENT X33
Yeah.  I've been taking a whole one.

DOCTOR X33
You have?

PATIENT X33
Cause I remember, I remember I was on a whole one before and @@@.

DOCTOR X33
Was it a different dose though?

PATIENT X33
See I didn't see?

DOCTOR X33
It @@@ dose, if you're on 20, so I'll give you a 40 and tell you to split in half.

PATIENT X33
Okay.

DOCTOR X33
If you're on 10, they'll give you a 20 and tell you to split in half so.

PATIENT X33
No I'll check it and see if it's 20 or 40.

DOCTOR X33
If it says that you're getting 20, you should be splitting it so.

PATIENT X33
Okay.

DOCTOR X33
Um, okay.  Give me a minute and I'll be right back.  We'll get some of this, I'll get some of the meds refilled and we'll get some of this, we'll help you get some PT.

PATIENT X33
Nothing for this except Tylenol.

DOCTOR X33
@@@.  The pain um, there is other things um.  Anti-inflammatories I don't think you'd be a good guy to take those.

PATIENT X33
You know my nerves are acting up in my foot cause I had that broken heel and foot.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah.

PATIENT X33
And uh the nerves and what the hell, oh my teeth bother me like hell.  I mean I don't know I can't get into the dentist unless I have a high diabetic count.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah you can't get into the dentist here.  @@@.

PATIENT X33
@@@ one had a blood count.  You can't do it but the blood would say it.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah.  You have to be shaken up to really warrant it and I don't think.

PATIENT X33
They had me in there once.  This diabetes has been fluctuating on and off, on and off.

DOCTOR X33
So, it's not a big enough problem, that's the problem.  This is my concern with giving you a bunch of pain medications.  You're on a lot of medications.

PATIENT X33
You'd better believe it.

DOCTOR X33
And you know a lot of it can cause drowsiness and other things and the pain medication would worsen all of those and especially the risk of falling, uh given all these other medications.

PATIENT X33
@@@ get up and go walk around again.  I can barely walk.  I walk like a duck you know.  It's just a few inches at a time.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah, I mean I don't want you to fall and break your hip or hit your head or something.

PATIENT X33
Ah, so you break your hip you know.

DOCTOR X33
Uh hip breaks are fatal in 50% of people your age.

PATIENT X33
Oh yeah, well how many?

DOCTOR X33
50%.

PATIENT X33
Well 50% do alright.

DOCTOR X33
I don't think it would be in good conscious I could do something like that. Um, you know I want to give you some pain medicine but I think we need to think very carefully about.

PATIENT X33
What's that?

DOCTOR X33
About what we can give you.

PATIENT X33
Well so I can pick it up tonight in the Pharmacy?

DOCTOR X33
@@@ you other than Tylenol at this point.

PATIENT X33
Well I've been taking Tylenol, that's a short running thing.

DOCTOR X33
When is the pain the worse, is it all day?

PATIENT X33
All day, all night.  I had a bad night.  I couldn't sleep at all last night.  Uh on and off, on and off, on and off, I don't know how many times, 20, 30, 40 times.  That's not sleeping.

DOCTOR X33
Where is it the worst, if you point one finger?

PATIENT X33
By here.

DOCTOR X33
Is it just in one certain place?

PATIENT X33
It's right in the eye.

DOCTOR X33
Yeah is it the entire eye, is it like a certain lid?

PATIENT X33
No it's in the left, see when I blink I feel it, I can't touch my eyelid.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Let me see; let me see what we have here that um.

PATIENT X33
Yeah please.

DOCTOR X33
That I think might be safe for you okay.

PATIENT X33
Please.

DOCTOR X33
Alright give me one second.

(DOCTOR OUT:  59:20  DOCTOR IN:  64:14)

DOCTOR X33
Alright so.  I was looking at; you were on Vicodin in the past?

PATIENT X33
Yeah I don't care for that Vicodin.

DOCTOR X33
Have you had Tylenol 3?

PATIENT X33
No, could Tylenol number 3, maybe I ought to try that.

DOCTOR X33
What was the issue with Vicodin?

PATIENT X33
Huh?

DOCTOR X33
What was your issue with Vicodin?

PATIENT X33
None.

DOCTOR X33
Did it work or?

PATIENT X33
Yeah it worked.  I was getting it three times a day in the hospital.

DOCTOR X33
Okay.  Do you want to try some of that or no?

PATIENT X33
Yeah, you better set me up with the Vicodin then.

DOCTOR X33
Okay we'll try that.  

PATIENT X33
@@@ the dosage.

DOCTOR X33
I don't know um.  This Vicodin has Tylenol in it so don't take any Tylenol on top of it.

PATIENT X33
Yeah.

DOCTOR X33
Uh, her husband will fill it actually @@@.

PATIENT X33
Huh.

DOCTOR X33
Her husband works in xxx I think.

PATIENT X33

DOCTOR X33
Uh she's been married for uh over two years now.

PATIENT X33

DOCTOR X33
Yeah she's still doing that I think.

PATIENT X33

PATIENT X33

DOCTOR X33

PATIENT X33

DOCTOR X33

PATIENT X33
Oh she was real talented.  Very good doctor, very good doctor.  In fact I was in love with her, she was so good.  She had to be cause.

DOCTOR X33
She won your heart.

PATIENT X33
Yeah, she won my heart.  She was an excellent doctor.  So she works in xxx.  She wasn't married then and I don't think she was engaged either.  How long you been here, just two years now?

DOCTOR X33

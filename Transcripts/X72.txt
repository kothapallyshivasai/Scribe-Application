PATIENT X72
But you are still gonna be here right?

DOCTOR X72
@@@.  So actually in June I won't be necessarily here but starting July 1st I'll be at xxx, so I'll be around.  @@@.  

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
So I'm not gonna see you.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
One more time maybe?

DOCTOR X72
Yes, you can come back in May if you want, you might.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
But I do want to see you @@@.

DOCTOR X72
Well @@@ I know.  I love to try and get you tuned up a bit.  @@@.  You probably remember our concerns.  You're not having any @@@ or did you know that.

PATIENT X72
I don't think so.

DOCTOR X72
Okay.

PATIENT X72
I mean you know I'm out of shape and all and that doesn't help you know.  I don't think anything out of the ordinary @@@. 

DOCTOR X72
Well we need to talk about something.  You know your statin medicines.

PATIENT X72
Yeah.

DOCTOR X72
You know your statin medicine for your cholesterol.  Okay like the simvastatin.

PATIENT X72
Yes.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ increase the dose because @@@ liver function tests.

PATIENT X72
Yeah.

DOCTOR X72
And um it can cause liver, it's not only your liver function tests, it's also your muscle enzymes.  Your liver is actually fine so the statins can cause your muscles to really ache okay and sometimes we can check on the blood level and your muscle enzymes and some people who @@@ have a normal muscle enzyme level and some people have an elevated muscle enzymes with no muscle aches.  And you haven't had a muscle enzyme level and you're on the medicine that's probably causing that okay.  So there's a problem when you, when the medicine causes symptoms but this medicine isn't only causing you symptoms, it's causing @@@ in the labs.

PATIENT X72
Why is that?

DOCTOR X72
@@@ get that so, we need to know if you have any muscle aches.  Cause if you're having muscle aches you should stop the medicine but right now, the risks of you getting muscle aches because your muscle enzyme is up is so low, @@@ heart attack, @@@ control is much higher.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT X72
Yes.

DOCTOR X72
So we have to kind of weigh the risks and the benefits here.  But that's why you need to know your cholesterol medicine is causing your liver enzymes to go up a little high okay.  Which I'm not worried about.

PATIENT X72
Now can they get lower, did it come down at all?

DOCTOR X72
So yes, if you come down definitely and then when you went back on it, a little bit, it went back up a tad okay.  You've always had high, so that's why I'm not so worried about it okay.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
It was @@@ back in 2001 and @@@ to @@@ now it's @@@ so I'm not really concerned about it.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Okay, not at all.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ liver problems, this is not your liver; it's your muscle enzymes.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Does that make sense?

PATIENT X72
So if you're not concerned I'm not worried about it.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
Cause you know what you're doing.

DOCTOR X72
I think we @@@.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Especially if you're not having muscle aches.  @@@ you need to stop it.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ right?

PATIENT X72
No.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
Yes.

DOCTOR X72
And uh your back pain, it looks like you saw Ortho and Pain Clinic.

PATIENT X72
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X72
So your EMG looks okay.

PATIENT X72
That is the nerve test, it looks good?

DOCTOR X72
@@@ so that's good, very good.  @@@ x-ray.  When are you going back there, we don't have that scheduled and then you have a Neurology appointment too.

PATIENT X72
In May.

DOCTOR X72
In May so that'll be good.  I think you should just continue the @@@.

PATIENT X72
And that's it.

DOCTOR X72
Okay.  The @@@.  You're taking the Wellbutrin twice a day.  You're off the venlafaxine.

PATIENT X72
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X72
You @@@ taking it.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
I'm sorry the BuSpar you're off of.

PATIENT X72
Yes.

DOCTOR X72
Okay.  Um so DOCTOR said in his note that he wants to increase your venlafaxine but it can increase your blood pressure and @@@ any comments about that, saying that @@@ go up on your venlafaxine.

PATIENT X72
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X72
I think that's definitely fine.  I'm going to put in my notes and send it to him and you can tell him too that DOCTOR says it's okay to go up on the venlafaxine.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
If your blood pressure goes up because of the venlafaxine, we'll take care of it okay.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Or your next doctor will.  That's no problem.  I @@@ medicine.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
What I can't do is make you @@@ better without medicine okay.

PATIENT X72
Right.

DOCTOR X72
Alright.  Good.  Health maintenance wise, you're gonna be due for a colonoscopy next year.

PATIENT X72
Has it been 10 years already, really?

DOCTOR X72
It's due in 2011.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
Time flies when your colon is not good.  And then you'll be due for a tetanus shot next year okay.  @@@ you can, I'm going to put all of this in here, there won't be a problem.  They'll be able to look at everything that's been done and we have it all right here.

PATIENT X72
Yeah but they're not going to be as good as you.

DOCTOR X72
I don't know, I hope so.  Your pneumonia shot won't be due for two years okay and they'll go through this with you.  You should get a flu shot every single year and I you know feel like a failure for not getting you to stop smoking.  @@@.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
I'm not going to be able to quit @@@ because I @@@ to stop smoking.

PATIENT X72
@@@.  You do everything you can.

DOCTOR X72
And the labs, I'm going to get on my soap box and you're only 60 years old, if you @@@.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
It's the worst addiction known to man.

PATIENT X72
No kidding, you aren't kidding.

DOCTOR X72
No I mean really.

PATIENT X72
People think it's hard to get off drugs.  I don't know.  I know @@@ 1% @@@.  And I hate it.  99% of these, boy let's quit right now.  That 1%.

DOCTOR X72
Well.

PATIENT X72
@@@ stuff now and then.

DOCTOR X72
Well you know we could @@@ fevers or chills, it's probably just a virus.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
We @@@ fluids, hydration and over-the-counter cough medicine.

PATIENT X72
Let me know.

DOCTOR X72
I'm gonna listen to your lungs, if your lungs are clear.  If you're not having fevers and you're not coughing up blood, @@@ virus.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
If you start feel like @@@ and don't come back @@@.

PATIENT X72

DOCTOR X72
Yeah definitely.  If you start to feel really bad then that's different.  You might have pneumonia but it sounds like.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
You just need to know that @@@.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
I know.  Well you need to know that sometimes um and @@@ here.  Sometimes viruses can turn into pneumonia.  @@@.

PATIENT X72
It's still a little high on this end.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ the ER.  I know, I remember looking at that @@@.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ You know how pneumonia kills people, @@@.  Who does pneumonia kill?

PATIENT X72
Old people.

DOCTOR X72
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

PATIENT X72
You know what though you're not gonna believe this.

DOCTOR X72
What?

PATIENT X72
I never had no problem breathing until I got pneumonia @@@.

DOCTOR X72
You see @@@.

PATIENT X72
I never got asthma, I never short of breath.

DOCTOR X72
It's all about the scarring in your lungs.  You're scarring your lungs every single day with cigarettes okay.  Every day you're scarring a little bit of your lungs.

PATIENT X72
But you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X72
When you get pneumonia, your big scar happens in your lungs okay.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
A big scar, you have a big infection, @@@ infection, if you get an infection in your hand or your toe or something like that or if it's in your lungs.

PATIENT X72
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X72
The infections a scar and so it's, the reason you get bacteria is because you're bringing it in with the smoke and with the toxins that get in there and cause infection so that's why smokers scar more, smokers get more infections that scar more and you know people who get pneumonia they start chipping off their lung volumes.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
Why have I not ever smoked?  Cause I want to live.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
I've got my vices, trust me.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
Oh no, no one else's.

PATIENT X72
Well that's it, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X72
I know @@@.

PATIENT X72
@@@ alcoholic quit drinking and smoking @@@.

DOCTOR X72
I know, trust me I have a lot of issues with my family and I have some @@@ smoke but I mean it never was an option for me because I knew.  I mean I'm not gonna lie to you, I've had a cigarette or two in my life outside and everything like that.

PATIENT X72
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR X72
But it's a thing, kind of like why do this to myself and I know it's hard.  I know it's hard but you can do it.  I know you can do it.  You're a slave to your cigarettes.  Deep breath.  And it's expensive.  Look how much money you've had.

PATIENT X72
Well that's why I only @@@.

DOCTOR X72
(Laughter)  @@@.

PATIENT X72
No because @@@ over I just drop from more heart attacks.

DOCTOR X72
Financially uh it's a benefit for you financial to date people with cigarettes?  I'm sorry, any swelling.

PATIENT X72
No.

DOCTOR X72
Any belly pain?

PATIENT X72
No

DOCTOR X72
Blood in the stools?

PATIENT X72
No.

DOCTOR X72
Vomiting, @@@ or anything like that?

PATIENT X72
No.

DOCTOR X72
Nope.  Well alright my friend I don't have anything for you today.

PATIENT X72
Well I guess that's good news.

DOCTOR X72
That's good news.  Alright.

PATIENT X72
And @@@ drop in and say hi.

DOCTOR X72
Alright I will.  So I'll have you @@@ four months @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ then you can do some lab after you see the new doctor in four months.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Okay and um I think we've covered everything.  Um you will need to stay seeing Mental Health.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
I'll @@@ new medicine and we can go up on the blood pressure medicine if we need to.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
And um um and let's jus real quick, just so we can kind of talk about it, do you know what the signs of heart failure are?

PATIENT X72
No.

DOCTOR X72
Let's talk about that.  So @@@ you need to come back and see DOCTOR or whoever come to the ER, if you start getting short breath just get in here, you need to come in.  If you start swelling up, you need to come in.  If you gain four pounds in one day you need to come in.

PATIENT X72
Ah I can do that.

DOCTOR X72
You can do that, okay.  Well if you start gaining weight, on a daily basis.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
You gain four pounds and all of a sudden you're just ten pounds up, that's water for you, that's not food.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Okay.  @@@.  If you start finding that you have to sit in a recliner to sleep because you can't sleep laying down on pillows, that's heart failure okay.  If you find that you know I used to be able to go up one flight of stairs and I didn't have to stop in the middle due to short of breath but now I can't even climb a few stairs without getting short of breath, that's heart failure okay.  Those are all signs of heart failure and you need to come in.  You've got a little bit of a @@@ here.  You @@@ your heart muscles too with a heart attack.

PATIENT X72
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X72
And stuff so we need to just keep that in tune.  One more thing I want to talk to you, I think I talked to you about this before is that you have a little bit or your heart function is less than 30% and what we know with people with heart function less than 30% is some other details that we know that sometimes they can benefit from a defibrillator.  We can put a little tiny box in your heart that if your heart would have stopped it would restart it.  Cause what we know is people with heart failure, when they die, you die suddenly.  Sudden cardiac death is what we call it and @@@.  And what we know is that people will live longer with heart failure if we put in something in their heart to shock it.  You see those defibrillators that you know the schools have and they have them in the airports and stuff like that in hospitals, that's what this is but it's in you already.

PATIENT X72
How come nobody has mentioned that before?

DOCTOR X72
Well @@@  I mean it's like you need to get back and see your cardiologist because we repeated a few echoes and it still shows that your heart function is a little bit low okay and it's right on the cusp definitely but I do want to make sure you have every benefit that you have that you can get to help this.  Alright, you're right on the cusp and obviously you're doing so good I would be hesitant to do that but I think that you deserve a discussion with them okay, a defibrillator is what that is.  Alright cause I'd hate to see you coming back here with you know your heart stopped and then a problem restarting it and it's too late @@@ when we could have had this discussion before and @@@ okay.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
So I want you to see the cardiologist again to discuss that next time.  There's no hurry.  This isn't an emergency or nothing like that.

PATIENT X72
I've never seen a cardiologist.

DOCTOR X72
Yeah you have.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
In May.

PATIENT X72
So I don't have one.  I mean why did that @@@ in May?

DOCTOR X72
Because you have significant heart disease.  You have enough heart disease that you can see a cardiologist once every, every year or so.

PATIENT X72
I agree.

DOCTOR X72
Okay, so I want you to make an appointment with a cardiologist @@@.

PATIENT X72
You can't put it in there already?

DOCTOR X72
No because the @@@ get a new one.

PATIENT X72
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X72
If they're not here, you'll need to get a new one.

PATIENT X72
So if I saw him in May would they automatically set one up in May or no?

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Okay.

PATIENT X72
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
Just tell them that you said that.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ there too.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.  That it's 30% and @@@.  The defibrillators @@@.  It's a surgical procedure but I think it's something that I think that you should have a conversation about @@@.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
@@@ for you.

PATIENT X72
Okay.

DOCTOR X72
Alrighty?

PATIENT X72
Thank you.

DOCTOR X72
@@@.

PATIENT X72
No what do I have to do @@@.

DOCTOR X72
Yeah right now.

PATIENT X72
The one I came out of.

DOCTOR X72
Yep it's the one right there.

PATIENT X72
@@@.

DOCTOR X72
Yep.  @@@.

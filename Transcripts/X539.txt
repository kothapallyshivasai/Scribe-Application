DOCTOR X539
A knee replacement?

PATIENT X539
Yeah they got to do that.  Uh I had a MRE and all that.  I'm on pain pills man and they don't get no more.

DOCTOR X539
Has it changed in character or it's the same thing right?  Same location, same place?

PATIENT X539
Yeah.  Same place and the only difference was pain just getting worse.  I had to talk to the Rheumatology I mean they do @@@ monthly goal so you don't gain anything you know so I always see Orthopedic myself and they say.  I only see those guys you know time and time and I'll have to tell them and they doing nothing.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah.

PATIENT X539
I go to see the Orthopedics and they say hey you know, that's the only thing going on.  They're gonna leave the pain.  They didn't give me any painkiller either.  They’re no help.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.

PATIENT X539
I uh, you know I had this pain in there long you know, uh so they supposed to do a biopsy uh then they cancelled it, this is the second time they cancelled it.  I was supposed to go on the 16th and they didn't do it now.

DOCTOR X539
So they biopsied what?

PATIENT X539
Yeah uh now they tell me on the 23rd.

DOCTOR X539
Okay, what do they want, what are they doing a biopsy on?

PATIENT X539
On the knee for long, uh @@@.

DOCTOR X539
Oh for the nodule in there right?

PATIENT X539
Yeah only on the right knee.

DOCTOR X539
Did they find this on the CT?  They were going to biopsy it, really?

PATIENT X539
Yeah, well they was supposed to, well that's what they told me and they cancelled uh twice and they said they didn't have room so now they set it for the 23rd.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.

PATIENT X539
I still got that pain in there though.

DOCTOR X539
It hurts with breathing?

PATIENT X539
Yeah when I cough you know.

DOCTOR X539
And that hasn't changed at all either?

PATIENT X539
No it ain't changed you know it’s, I just, I can hold out on coughing.  If I have to cough it pains me.  And in Rheumatology he ordered it long ago, I mean when they got it in the program @@@ and they said they didn't have room enough yeah.

DOCTOR X539
So you're supposed to go next month again?

PATIENT X539
Yeah.

DOCTOR X539
On the 16th.

PATIENT X539
I was supposed to go the 16th.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah.

PATIENT X539
Uh when he cancelled it he said they didn't have room so now they move it to the 23rd.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.  Yeah that's probably something they're gonna take care of for you just ahead but they've got to figure out what that is.

PATIENT X539
Yeah well if they say I need it, I mean the doctor @@@ he don't know what to do until he get this biopsy and this is the second time he cancelled it.  So I'm gonna see him on the 18th so I @@@.  They didn't do it.

DOCTOR X539
Sorry I'm putting in some notes here.  So you're gonna see the lung doctors on the 18th?

PATIENT X539
Huh?

DOCTOR X539
You see the lung doctor on the 18th and then the radiologist who's supposed to do the biopsy?

PATIENT X539
Yeah, right, right.  I was supposed to do it on the 16th, now they called me and said they only, you know, they're filled up so they moved to 10:30 but I see this doctor on the 18th.  So better check it.

DOCTOR X539
I think you're gonna have the biopsy that day.  So you'll have to follow it up I guess.

PATIENT X539
Yeah well he said he don't know what's going on, when he get that.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah cause they may want to look at the tissue too cause.

PATIENT X539
Right, right.

DOCTOR X539
So otherwise @@@ otherwise.

PATIENT X539
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X539
So, what do you taking for your pain?

PATIENT X539
Uh they gave me this, I got Tylenol 3 codeine and it don't help.

DOCTOR X539
It doesn't.

PATIENT X539
But I'll tell you.

DOCTOR X539
I mean we can, we can do other stuff too, or you can go higher than that.  What kind of stronger stuff we got.  The question is have you ever had a bad reaction with like Vicodin or anything like that?

PATIENT X539
Well I had some Vicodin, but I had it and it didn't do anything.

DOCTOR X539
Didn't do anything.

PATIENT X539
No it didn't do anything uh this Tylenol 3, I want to say it helps a little bit.  But I had the Vicodin in its place and it didn't do nothing.  The doctor over there tell me that the only thing gonna ease the pain, you know the doctor.

DOCTOR X539
Is the hip replacement?

PATIENT X539
Yeah I mean we definitely fix that.

DOCTOR X539
And we can't do that until we figure out what's going on with the lung.

PATIENT X539
Right so this lung problem is a whole other thing.

DOCTOR X539
@@@ sorry.  Give me one second, I'll be right back.

PATIENT X539
So this problem is holding up everything.

DOCTOR X539
Uh-huh. 

PATIENT X539
See all of this, they always inform me when the appointment is, I mean they are and they said they didn't do it so this is the second time that they moved it up.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah.

PATIENT X539
Now I thought, when I see him on the 18th and he still @@@ what I mean.

DOCTOR X539
@@@.  It's going to be listed for the 16th.

PATIENT X539
I know but well they cancelled it doctor.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah you know I would call them and ask them why.

PATIENT X539
Yes.  Why.

DOCTOR X539
And maybe they can just switch you back.  Um.

PATIENT X539
Yeah because.

DOCTOR X539
@@@.

PATIENT X539
Well I need to get this here.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah I know.  That's holding everything up so.

PATIENT X539
That holding up.

DOCTOR X539
See what we can do here.

PATIENT X539
Well I'm telling you they called me and said the 23rd which is next Monday instead of this Monday.

DOCTOR X539
Oh September 23rd or August 23rd, just an extra couple weeks.

PATIENT X539
Yeah, August the 23rd.

DOCTOR X539
But they still moved you so okay.  See what's holding it up.

(Doctor calls Radiology)

DOCTOR X539
Alright so the scanner.

PATIENT X539
Now this uh.

DOCTOR X539
You need a refill?

PATIENT X539
No uh well I just got this but uh, I'm having all kinds of problems with this uh it really, every time I come here well my blood pressure's up and I @@@ and it still up.  Now I tell you doctor uh, like at the @@@ they be on me for years.

DOCTOR X539
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X539
So they discontinued and then they come up with this drug and then well I had one before this and it didn't do anything at all so now when it has this, it ain't doing anything, it ain't been helping a lot.

DOCTOR X539
Do you feel better when you're taking it?

PATIENT X539
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X539
Your blood pressure's great.

PATIENT X539
I was talking to the um, the Pharmacy in Walgreens and he said he never heard of it.

DOCTOR X539
What?  That's the most common drug for hypertension.

PATIENT X539
Yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR X539
But your blood pressure's doing good okay.

PATIENT X539
Well I had just a little @@@ for a year on that, I've never had any problem and uh they @@@ so everybody trying to figure out what I need just so, but they need to come up with some stuff, I'm telling you this is something that really don't work at all.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.  Alright um any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X539

DOCTOR X539
The same thing you've been having?

PATIENT X539
Yeah, yeah I mean.  I mean you know I'm, nothing new.

DOCTOR X539
Nothing new.  It's all just about the same alright.

PATIENT X539
It's all the same.  The only thing wrong it getting worse.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah it's getting worse.  I talked to Radiology and the problem is they have to fix the CT scanner on that day or that week so there's actually no way you can get it done that week.  I know it's a pain in the ass but they should be ready, you got the appointment for the 23rd.

PATIENT X539
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X539
Did you get the time?

PATIENT X539
Yeah I have it on the 23rd.

DOCTOR X539
You've got to make sure you just go to that appointment.  So the Pulmonary people, call them and explain to them what's going on, tell them what you told me.  The thing is this issue is holding up everything it's all pain you're having in your hip and you can't have surgery until they figure out what's going on there okay.  (Doctor spoke with someone who came to the door)  I'm sorry.
 
PATIENT X539

DOCTOR X539
Alright you can have a seat we're done with this.  We've got to figure out something to at least get your pain while you're waiting getting everything done here.  You've tried tramadol right?

PATIENT X539
Yeah it didn't do nothing.

DOCTOR X539
Didn't do anything.

PATIENT X539
So now, now I mean uh now they gave me uh Tylenol 3 and it helps a little bit but.

DOCTOR X539
And you tried Vicodin and that didn't do anything?

PATIENT X539
Huh?

DOCTOR X539
Vicodin didn't do anything right?

PATIENT X539
No Vicodin, so that's why they gave me the codeine, the Tylenol 3.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.  Have you tried Norco?

PATIENT X539
Huh?

DOCTOR X539
Did they give you something called Norco ever?

PATIENT X539

DOCTOR X539
You say it did help.

PATIENT X539
Yeah well you can help me; I mean it helped it some but that other stuff it don't help at all.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.

PATIENT X539
So I got the Tylenol 3 and I been using that so I take that.

DOCTOR X539
Alright uh.  Let's see.  I mean the only other thing we could go to is we could go to like morphine but I don't know if I want to do that though.

PATIENT X539
No.

DOCTOR X539
Will you be able to bear it out at least for a little longer if we give you more of your Tylenol 3, if we make sure you have enough of a constant supply of Tylenol 3?

PATIENT X539
Yes, uh-huh, so I'll stick with the Tylenol 3 for the time being right now.

DOCTOR X539
And you're still seeing Rheumatology correct?

So I use the nebulizer maybe once a day you know.

DOCTOR X539

DOCTOR X539
You got where you can walk a bunch and then you're okay.

PATIENT X539

PATIENT X539
Well that's.

DOCTOR X539
I can't make things go any faster.

PATIENT X539
Well that's holding up everything.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah.

PATIENT X539
Alright.  It's only been there three, four weeks ago.

DOCTOR X539
@@@.  I'm really sorry about that, that it happened.

PATIENT X539
Yeah.

DOCTOR X539
This will fix the problem.  Give me a minute; you can just have a seat.  Give me a minute to go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

PATIENT X539
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  73:08  DOCTOR IN:  78:57)

DOCTOR X539
You have the pain with the cough right?

PATIENT X539

We'll see, I'm gonna give you another cough medicine to see if that'll help your cough down and keep the pain down a little bit in the chest here.

PATIENT X539
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X539
And then we'll make sure you get enough Tylenol 3s.

PATIENT X539

DOCTOR X539
Got it, got it.

PATIENT X539
But I got everything else here already.

DOCTOR X539
So like I said the cough medicine we should be able to say that you need it for a cough.

PATIENT X539
Yeah the one I take is in the evening.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.

PATIENT X539
If I don't cough then I don't.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah you don't need to take it.

PATIENT X539
Right then just.

DOCTOR X539
So.

PATIENT X539
I mostly cough at night you know.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah so what you're gonna do is just take it maybe a half an hour or an hour before bed.

PATIENT X539
Yeah.

DOCTOR X539
So you can take it before you go to bed.

PATIENT X539
Yeah I know, that's what I do, so I don't have any problem in the day but at night.

DOCTOR X539

PATIENT X539
At night.

DOCTOR X539
Okay.  And then I want to see you back in three months because I want to make sure everything's going along.

Uh, uh well they'll probably call when they get the stuff, once I get.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah we'll keep trying to move, you'll keep following up if anything comes up that I notice then I'll.

PATIENT X539
Well they said uh you know once I had this biopsy and all then I go back and I supposed to go back and see them.

DOCTOR X539
Oh the hip surgeons right, yeah, yeah.  So you need to get the biopsy and you'll need to wait for the Pulmonary guys and the pathologist to look at it and see what they think it is and see if anything needs to be done @@@.

PATIENT X539
Now this thing is hold up.

DOCTOR X539
Everything.

PATIENT X539
Holding up @@@.

DOCTOR X539
Got it, got it, but yeah as soon as you get it, as soon as you get a call that you might be okayed for surgery you can call the Orthopedic guys and set up another appointment.  Cause we'll do the work-up, we'll get the EKG and everything and do the work-up to make sure you're ready.

PATIENT X539
Yeah, yeah I mean once that report is in then they'll give you a call, they gonna call you anyway.

DOCTOR X539
Okay @@@.

PATIENT X539
Yeah I mean they can do that I mean to see if you okayed it or what else so.  But they told me that's the only thing I know.  You know like I was @@@ last year I would need to have @@@.

DOCTOR X539
Yeah this is just a little long, the whole time in pain I mean its.  I understand.

PATIENT X539

Just be, as long as you ask them to explain it to you, cause you want to get the, this may take a while and the hip surgery is going to be long and complicated too.

PATIENT X539

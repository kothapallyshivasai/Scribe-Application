DOCTOR X99
Out of work @@@.

PATIENT X99
No the bad things.

DOCTOR X99
The bad things, oh @@@ that.

PATIENT X99
That's why I've been gaining weight.  Well I knew I was gaining because I used to work out all the time.

DOCTOR X99
Yeah.

PATIENT X99
And I'd weigh myself at the health place and I'd say oh no this has gotta be wrong you now.

Earlier this week and they said that you're doing so good that they don't even need to see you but @@@.

DOCTOR X99
Yeah I mean it's @@@.  Basically they said that you're doing so good that uh the Coronary Therapy @@@.

PATIENT X99
Oh not, would I be given any tests or anything?

DOCTOR X99
So we.

PATIENT X99
My wife is worried because she says @@@ not doing anything?

DOCTOR X99
No, no.  The most important thing to do is and you've had stents in the past is make sure your cholesterol is well controlled, your blood pressure and your weight.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
That's the best way to prove that you won't have uh

PATIENT X99
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X99
Or have to use another stent.  We don't usually do stress tests on a regular basis.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
And we don't use @@@ or any kind of angiograms or anything unless you have pains or symptoms.

PATIENT X99
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X99
If you were to have any chest pain at all you would need one of those.

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X99
Alright.

DOCTOR X99
But since you've done so good since your stents.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
That it's not really indicated unless you have some new symptoms.

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
So it's not like you can go on regular tests for your heart.  The most important test for your heart is cholesterol and blood pressure.

PATIENT X99
Oh okay.  So that would be checked @@@.

DOCTOR X99
Yeah, we would definitely check it.

PATIENT X99
Okay, cholesterol.

DOCTOR X99
Typically we check your cholesterol every year at least.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
And um.

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
We normally do tests at least once or twice a year for your potassium because you're on the lisinopril.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
And the lisinopril could @@@ your potassium.

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.  Your potassium levels are fine, it's never been a problem but every time we check your cholesterol that's something we can check.

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
Alright now like I said you're due for a potassium test.  So if you decide, after you're done, we might have you go down there and have them just check it real quick.

PATIENT X99
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X99
And we're going to see if your potassium is okay.

PATIENT X99
Okay and then cholesterol test @@@.

DOCTOR X99
Your cholesterol, your last cholesterol was in August so you'll be due.

PATIENT X99
Yeah cause that was @@@.

DOCTOR X99
@@@ this summer so we'll go ahead and order it for you.

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
And you can have that at your convenience and have you come back to the clinic for that.

PATIENT X99
Yeah uh-huh.  But they'll call me or do I have to call?

DOCTOR X99
You can come any time to the Lab.

PATIENT X99
Oh alright.

DOCTOR X99
Any time at all.

PATIENT X99
Okay, but I figured now that I'm off I'd have more time.

DOCTOR X99
You have more free time sure yeah.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
It just means @@@ fasting.

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
When you get the labs drawn.

PATIENT X99
So as long as I fast okay.

DOCTOR X99
And then I can @@@, usually @@@ I'll give you a call back or @@@ will come to my in basket.  If you get @@@ who doesn't I might not know that you had it so, they usually always come back to my @@@. 

PATIENT X99
Okay.

DOCTOR X99
I'll give you a call if everything is okay.  So for your heart you're still taking the lisinopril 2.5, you're still taking the metoprolol 50 twice a day.

PATIENT X99
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X99
Plavix and then aspirin right?

PATIENT X99
Yeah, a baby aspirin.

DOCTOR X99
A baby aspirin @@@.  For your cholesterol you're taking three medications for your cholesterol.

PATIENT X99
Right.

DOCTOR X99
The niacin, the gemfibrozil and the simvastatin alright.

PATIENT X99
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X99
@@@ and I'll take a look at you.

PATIENT X99
Alright.  I just had a question @@@.  Just one week @@@.

DOCTOR X99
Yes then you can follow up with her.

PATIENT X99
@@@.

DOCTOR X99
@@@.

PATIENT X99
Oh okay.  Yeah because @@@ quite a while is @@@ for the next year is fine.

DOCTOR X99
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X99
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X99
Um and then how's that groin pain?

PATIENT X99
Uh I had that operation.

DOCTOR X99
Good.

PATIENT X99
And after that I was fine.

DOCTOR X99
So you ended up having a hernia?

PATIENT X99
I think yes, yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X99
Uh-huh good.

PATIENT X99
And uh you know, about a week of just taking it easy @@@ and then uh after about a month or more @@@.

DOCTOR X99
So three months @@@, the last time you described the exact symptoms of a hernia.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
But we didn't see it; it wasn't out when we saw it.  Did it come back?

PATIENT X99
Yeah the pain was there.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.

PATIENT X99
Nearly always there and so.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.

PATIENT X99
One time I was lying there and then I, my wife she went to Walgreens, they gave her @@@.

DOCTOR X99
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X99
And that helped in the meantime until uh I had the operation.

DOCTOR X99
Good.

PATIENT X99
So I was wearing that every day, the hernia belt and I was wearing that every day until like several weeks later and I had the operation.

DOCTOR X99
So when do you think you had the operation?

PATIENT X99
Uh October.

DOCTOR X99
October?  Good, good for you, well that's good.

PATIENT X99
Yeah.

DOCTOR X99
You sure sounded I mean @@@, you sounded exactly like you had a hernia but.

PATIENT X99
Yes.

DOCTOR X99
But it's very, but we didn't see it then.

PATIENT X99
Hmm.  @@@.  But not as much.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.

PATIENT X99
Because I think at that time is when @@@.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.

PATIENT X99
The @@@.

DOCTOR X99
And your heart stayed okay during the surgery, no problems?

PATIENT X99
No problems.  @@@.  I am just slower now.

DOCTOR X99
Yeah.

PATIENT X99
@@@ but I still work out every day you know.

DOCTOR X99
Great.

PATIENT X99
I do cardio for about a half hour of cardio and then leg lifts and you know some days are easier, some days are longer you know.

DOCTOR X99
You bet.

PATIENT X99
@@@ you know.

DOCTOR X99
Well the only other thing that I see that I don't think that we talked about before is that you don't have diabetes based on what we have but your sugars are on the higher end of normal.

PATIENT X99
Oh.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.  Just one more thing to keep your eye on.  It's usually less than 100 for your fasting sugars @@@ and yours is 108.

PATIENT X99
Oh.

DOCTOR X99
If it was 176, you would be a diabetic.

PATIENT X99
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X99
So it's just something to keep an eye on.  You know, take out all the salt and the good fat @@@.

PATIENT X99
@@@.

DOCTOR X99
@@@ nothing but we still need to keep an eye on it.

PATIENT X99
@@@.

DOCTOR X99
Okay.

PATIENT X99
So.

DOCTOR X99
Diet if you can but @@@ um definitely you know and if you do develop diabetes it'll be very bad for your heart.

PATIENT X99
Oh.

DOCTOR X99
But it's something that for preventative reasons that obviously @@@ okay.

PATIENT X99
Alright.

DOCTOR X99
So we’re are up to date with your shots um, ooh you haven't had a tetanus shot in five years @@@.  And the flu shot?

PATIENT X99

DOCTOR X99
Okay.

PATIENT X99

DOCTOR X99
And the pneumonia shot you got in 2008.  @@@ Alright, have a seat up here.  So no chest pain?

PATIENT X99

DOCTOR X99
How many days a week are you exercising now?

PATIENT X99

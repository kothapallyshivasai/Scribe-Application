DOCTOR X663
PATIENT.

PATIENT X663 
I'm right here.

DOCTOR X663
@@@.

PATIENT X663
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X663
So we'll come back here.

PATIENT X663
Yeah.

DOCTOR X663
Right across from where you were.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
It's on your left or on your right side, down here to the right.  Unfortunately @@@ back like in April or so.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
And then looking at the notes you've been here a couple times in the interim at Urgent Care for uh testicular pain, URI symptoms.  How is that stuff doing now?

PATIENT X663
I've got some still coughing.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
I need to find out why I'm coughing instead of somebody giving me a cough syrup, open up the airways and my @@@ but my back is giving problems.

DOCTOR X663
Still bothering you.

PATIENT X663
Yes.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
I think I just.

DOCTOR X663
So how long total have you been coughing for now, let's say how many months?

PATIENT X663
I'd say I been probably since the last time I come over here.

DOCTOR X663
Since April?

PATIENT X663
No.

DOCTOR X663
Oh.  Since so, I saw you in April.

PATIENT X663
Yeah.

DOCTOR X663
We talked about your back and your diabetes and then you came into the Urgent Care in May.

PATIENT X663
For coughing.

DOCTOR X663
Uh your stomach hurt and then uh in July it looks like you came in with four days of a nonproductive cough, runny nose and sore throat and that was back in July and so are you still.

PATIENT X663
No I didn't tell them, I come here, I was coughing, I told them I was coughing and it was a dry cough.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
I didn't tell them nothing about my nose.

DOCTOR X663
So how many months would you say it's been going on for then total?

PATIENT X663
I'd say it's been going on for four months.

DOCTOR X663
Four months okay.

PATIENT X663
@@@.

DOCTOR X663
Dry cough and what seems to bring it about?

PATIENT X663
I don't know just sometimes I just start coughing.

DOCTOR X663
No known trigger so it's not like um, is there something you can think of in terms of time of day, exposure to potential allergens?

PATIENT X663
Well sometimes it's at night.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
And sometimes in the daytime, sometimes it's at night.  I drink water sometime and that helps but I just start coughing and like.

DOCTOR X663
Any history of acid reflux or heartburn?

PATIENT X663
No, no doctor's ever told me.

DOCTOR X663
Do you ever experience after you eat that you get a burning in your chest at all?

PATIENT X663
No.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.  Any history of um postnasal drip or feeling anything drip down the back of your throat?

PATIENT X663
Well you know but I think you know my first instinct is I think I may have one some of this.

DOCTOR X663
What did you think they had?

PATIENT X663
Sometime, just according to the weather, sometimes my nostrils sometimes start just dripping.

DOCTOR X663
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X663
And that's the reason I think I because years ago I didn't know I had it and it could be ever so cold outside and I didn't put nothing on my head so I think that I might have some kind of sinus cause most of my work, I work with the airlines so most of my work for at least 15 years was outside.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.  I want to just see if we ever did any.  I mean I it's just that after four months we should think about getting a chest x-ray.  Do you have a significant smoking history?

PATIENT X663
I never smoked in my life.

DOCTOR X663
Good.  And cause you don't have and uh the lisinopril, how long have you been on this?  Do you feel like when you started taking the lisinopril back in April is that around when your cough started?

PATIENT X663
No.

DOCTOR X663
Or had you been having it before to treat your blood pressure.  So you had been on @@@ and we changed you over to lisinopril.

PATIENT X663
Right.

DOCTOR X663
And so do you feel like, is that around the time when your cough started when they changed those medications around?

PATIENT X663
Well.

DOCTOR X663
Certain people, sometimes lisinopril can cause people to have a cough.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Do you feel that's when the cough started?

PATIENT X663
Well I knew I started coughing but why I started coughing I don't know.

DOCTOR X663
Yeah but do you feel @@@ that those were related?

PATIENT X663
Well I really can't say.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.  Definitely something to think about.  And how much is this cough bothering you?  Is it a lot?

PATIENT X663
Well it concerns me that I'm coughing.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
And I'm you now I deeply concerned about the coughing so I was originally in a program @@@ was here in xxx and the head doctor here in xxx, I think its DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X663
DOCTOR yeah.

PATIENT X663
DOCTOR he said that people are usually coughing like that he said that it could be some other problems that is thinking about and they should do tests.

DOCTOR X663
Okay, no you're absolutely, you're absolutely right.  And I may just have this piece of paper that can describe it.  Okay.  Okay yeah, so you're right.  So we haven't done anything to investigate this.  We probably should just get a chest x-ray since it's been going on for so long but it could very well be either as simple as seasonal allergies and just getting congestion versus um taking the lisinopril can also give people a cough uh in people so then we could just switch you to another medicine so.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
But we'll do some of those things.  You could just get the chest x-ray today cause if you're concerned you might as well just get the chest x-ray so if nothing serious is going on then maybe like you'd sleep a little bit easier.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So we can do that.  Let's see we can do that today, I'll set you up.  And so the other thing we talked about um last time you were here was your diabetes, we talked about it for a while.  So you were seen back in April your diabetes was pretty poorly controlled so how have your sugars been at home since then?

PATIENT X663
Well, seems like I can feel myself doing a pretty good job of controlling that.

DOCTOR X663
What kind of numbers are we getting with our glucometer?

PATIENT X663
Well the numbers is sometimes right on the borderline for me but like I say, like I told you before I don't eat uh, I don't eat nothing that has sugar in it.  I don't put a lot of salt or nothing on there and I'm eating smaller portions of food.

DOCTOR X663
Good.

PATIENT X663
Okay.  I do eat a little bit more, instead of eating once or twice or three times a day.

DOCTOR X663
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X663
I might eat four times.

DOCTOR X663
Good.

PATIENT X663
You know but I eat smaller portions.

DOCTOR X663
But what kind of numbers are you getting like you know first thing in the morning for example.  Before you eat breakfast what kind of reading have you been getting in your blood sugars?

PATIENT X663
Well I'm getting under 200s.  I'm getting 100s to 200s sliding.

DOCTOR X663
We want them between 90 and 125 ideally.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So it's better than above 200.

PATIENT X663
Yes.

DOCTOR X663
Hopefully but it's not quite where we want it.  So next time, if you could even bring your glucometer in that would also be helpful so we could go through it.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Together, so we're gonna check your A1c today to see how that is doing and what kind of numbers are you getting after meals would you say?

PATIENT X663
What?

DOCTOR X663
How many times a day are you checking your sugars?

PATIENT X663
I'm only checking them one time.

DOCTOR X663
Okay and that's usually first thing in the morning before breakfast?

PATIENT X663
Yeah.

DOCTOR X663
And that's fine yeah that means that we got a and certainly if you're doing your part with the uh eating habits @@@ getting you on some better medicines and ultimately you're supposed to be taking now the glipizide 20 mg twice a day okay and why aren't you on metformin?

PATIENT X663
Metformin had an affect on the kidneys.

DOCTOR X663
@@@ so that's perfect okay.  So it was making me something crazy for why you weren't on it and it looks like um let's see and concerning your blood pressure are you checking your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X663
Yes.

DOCTOR X663
What kind of numbers are you getting?

PATIENT X663
I've been getting real good numbers because I was a little upset when I saw she had over there.

DOCTOR X663
131/77.

PATIENT X663
No she had the first number.

DOCTOR X663
143/82 yeah.

PATIENT X663
Right and I told her for me to wait for a few minutes and take it over again.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
And probably if you would take it now it's probably lower because I get a little excited when I come to the doctor's office.

DOCTOR X663
Uh-huh and what have you been getting at home?

PATIENT X663
I been getting uh I been getting something like the other day I got 68/123.

DOCTOR X663
Great.

PATIENT X663
Numbers like that.

DOCTOR X663
Good 120/68.  So blood pressure that sounds like you're doing really great, excellent.

PATIENT X663
But they done told me you know that uh the blood pressure if it stays up high it would do damage to my organs.

DOCTOR X663
Exactly.

PATIENT X663
So they told me they wanted to get it down to the lower levels and that's why I've been really working on it.

DOCTOR X663
Good, that's really good.

PATIENT X663
And I have lost weight too doc.

DOCTOR X663
Let's see here how much do you weigh, yeah wow you've lost seven pounds.  What do you attribute this too, just trying to eat smaller portions?

PATIENT X663
I been just eating smaller portions.  I don't eat late at night.

DOCTOR X663
Great.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Wow.

PATIENT X663
After like 9 o'clock at night I don't have no food.  I just drink a lot of water now.

DOCTOR X663
Good.

PATIENT X663
I don't drink pop but I never have been a pop drinker.

DOCTOR X663
Excellent.

PATIENT X663
I do drink a little orange juice.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
About 4 ounces a day and mainly because of the potassium.

DOCTOR X663
Yeah.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Well 7 pounds, you know losing it like a healthy rate also it's not like you know this is gonna be a @@@ change for you, that's excellent, that's great.  And did they tell you about the results of your colonoscopy already?  So they removed like eight polyps that did not indicate cancer um but these types of polyps can turn into cancer, they would want to get a repeat on you in five years.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So but nothing scary now.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So you're wrapped up with that and then so tell me about this back pain, what's gonna happen now?

PATIENT X663
Well the back pain I had a.

DOCTOR X663
I know we talked before that you had um you know a herniated disk.

PATIENT X663
Right.

DOCTOR X663
And that you had tried some physical therapy and how do you feel that things are going since you were here last?

PATIENT X663
Well I'm still having, you know I haven't got a problem uh.  I guess some of it I should have been over here in the gym taking therapy.  I'm used to taking exercise over in the gym.

DOCTOR X663
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X663
They do have a facility over here I can come and take exercise.

DOCTOR X663
Yeah.

PATIENT X663
I'm tending to think some of it was my fault for not getting up and getting over here taking exercise.

DOCTOR X663
So how far do you live?  How far north or south are you to Warren?

PATIENT X663
Uh one block past xxx.

DOCTOR X663
Oh so you don't live that far.

PATIENT X663
No.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.

PATIENT X663
No.

DOCTOR X663
Okay yeah so you live like way on @@@ south side then yeah.  Maybe you should just come on a regular basis.  Cause they tried to allegedly contact you a couple times um but basically if we want to send you to you know the back surgeons or anything we have to document that you've done three months of physical therapy here.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So let's just go ahead and put that back in, let's give it a whirl.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Let's see what happens and do need any Tylenol or any?

PATIENT X663
No, no.

DOCTOR X663
Okay good.

PATIENT X663
I'm not really for taking medication.

DOCTOR X663
Okay, good.  And we can also give you in addition to physical therapy there's a gym here um if you want to go to that.

PATIENT X663
Oh I'd like to go to your gym.

DOCTOR X663
Yes let me put in Recreation Therapy.  Oh yeah you live so close, I'll put in for a referral, that's in.  Okay.  Good.  @@@ and then I'll send a reminder with, I'll send a reminder, so did you need a flu shot today or @@@ tetanus shot.  Are you amenable to getting a tetanus shot today?

PATIENT X663
Yes I'll take the tetanus.

DOCTOR X663
Okay perfect.  We'll put this in, that was ordered.

PATIENT X663
Put in a chest x-ray.

DOCTOR X663
Yeah you're gonna go do that after we're done here.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
That's about it.  Good, excellent and let's see here so you've already seen the eye doctors and let's see they don't need to see you back for a year from that time.  Oh here we go, oh uh they want to see you nine months after the first time so that's fine.  So it sounds like the main things that we're gonna do today are um so we'll try to stop this cough and see if there's any changes we can make to your medications to get your blood sugar under better control cause all you have right now for your diabetes right is the max dose of the glipizide and we don't have any diabetes labs since you were here last time.  Okay and like a said the blood sugars @@@.  So let me just @@@ take a listen here.  And before you started seeing us last year in April had you been taking any medicines for your diabetes previously or no?

PATIENT X663
Yes.

DOCTOR X663
Yeah.  You were already on the glipizide at that point?

PATIENT X663
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X663
Okay.  Okay.  Your lungs sound clear okay.  So let me see, so besides doing a chest x-ray let's see how many things we're gonna change today okay.  I'm going to talk to DOCTOR I'll be back in just a couple minutes.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:26  DOCTOR IN:  52:05)

DOCTOR X663
Alright here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna do a couple things.  So the first thing is we're gonna change your medications around a little bit.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
And then we can get your chest x-ray done today so I'm gonna add another medicine for your diabetes, it's called Actos and it's just a pill you take once a day, @@@ you're now gonna be taking you know two pills in the morning or like.

PATIENT X663
Three pills a day.

DOCTOR X663
Yeah and then still just your two pills at night.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
I'm gonna add this in and then keep checking your sugars and if you do find yourself getting you know hypoglycemic, sweaty, lightheaded, dizzy and you know sugars below 80s then stop taking the new medicine.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So let me put that in.  @@@ okay.  We're good and then I'm also gonna change so you've been on xxxicar before for your blood pressure and they switched you over to lisinopril.  Lisinopril can give people a cough and usually xxxicar won't so we're just gonna switch you back to the xxxicar that you were on when you came in here.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
They put you on the lisinopril because it was cheaper, it was on the VA formulary but the cough is a very, very common reason for people to be switched over to xxxicar.  @@@ seen here we weren't sure they had put you on that but that's totally fine so we will put that in and we'll take the lisinopril out medicines so perfect.  So we'll put you on Losartan because it's in the same class of medications.  It works the same way as lisinopril but it usually doesn't cause a cough okay.

PATIENT X663
So discontinue the lisinopril?

DOCTOR X663
Right you're gonna pick up this new medicine at the window instead.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Try this out and we'll see how it does.  So we're gonna have you pick that up but the very, very first thing um we're gonna do is to have you go get that chest x-ray.  So let me just change it to stat so what we're gonna do is you're just gonna go get the chest x-ray done right now and then you'll just wait out here, I'll tell you that it's normal and then I'll have you go to the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So we'll just that way that will be off of our chest as it were and then we'll everything with that is good and then we'll also have you go down to the Lab today so we can look at your A1c.  We'll look at your blood glucose control for the past three months.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So the two things we're gonna do now is um I'm actually going to get your @@@ right now so we'll put in the order.

PATIENT X663
Give you a copy of that.

DOCTOR X663
The yeah, so you're gonna do three things um right now.  We are gonna do, we're gonna have the nurse give you a shot.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
You're gonna go down to X-Ray and get that x-ray.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
You're gonna go to the Lab and get some blood drawn and just wait up here, I'll tell you everything looks great and then you're gonna go to the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X663
Okay they can take, when they draw the blood they can give you the results right away?

DOCTOR X663
No unfortunately the blood sugar for the past three months is gonna take a couple weeks to come back.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
But I can certainly give you a call when it comes back and the chest x-ray we're gonna have you back here for the results cause we'll have it back within an hour.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
So let's walk you over to the nurses' desk.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Um it's just right here.  Just have a seat in here sir.

PATIENT X663
Okay.

DOCTOR X663
Okay and then you're just going to go down to the X-Ray and the Lab and then just wait out here and we'll let you know what the x-ray shows.

PATIENT X663
Thank you ma'am.

DOCTOR X663
Thank you.

PATIENT LEAVES:  57:43.

Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
And I'm start; gradually I'm starting, my weight's going up.

DOCTOR X713
Good.

PATIENT X713
And that's a little bit better.

DOCTOR X713
Your weight um okay.

PATIENT X713
I think they weighed me at 238 but I got about four pounds of clothes on.  The last time I came up here and seen DOCTOR my weight was like 210.

DOCTOR X713
17.

PATIENT X713
Or 217 yeah.

DOCTOR X713
Good job, good job.

PATIENT X713
I feel a little bit better when I put on just a little bit more weight.  I don't know why cause I like to walk a lot and I don't want to get.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.

PATIENT X713
I don't want some wind to come by and blow me away.  But normally I've never had that.

DOCTOR X713
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X713
I'm down to five cigarettes a day now and it's getting to the point, I was smoking ten.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.  You know what.

PATIENT X713
Now the last time I smoked.  The last time I smoked a cigarette was 7 o'clock this morning and I feel good.  I take a couple shots of albuterol.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
To help me breathe a little bit easier.  I don't know what it is; the climate up there in xxx is a lot different than where I live at.

DOCTOR X713
Okay you know um.

PATIENT X713
Cause they got a lot of factories around there.

DOCTOR X713
You know why we were concerned because you shouldn't be smoking at all.

PATIENT X713
Huh?

DOCTOR X713
You shouldn't be smoking at all.

PATIENT X713
You know what, I wake up in the morning and I drink a cup of coffee.

DOCTOR X713
Cause you're very lucky, we found the lung cancer early enough.

PATIENT X713
Yeah.

DOCTOR X713
They were able to do surgery on it.

PATIENT X713
Okay now, let me tell you something.

DOCTOR X713
If you keep smoking it's gonna happen again.

PATIENT X713
Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to go through that again.  I want to live at least another 2 1/2, 3 years.  See I have this book that comes out you know, selling through this publication in Oregon.  When I was out there to visit my brother I went to go see, I talked to an agent.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
And uh but anyway that kind of relieves my stress level and worrying about my pain and the condition I'm in.

DOCTOR X713
If you set you can you know.

PATIENT X713
They were gonna send me over; I went over to see the cardiologist.  I think it was the 19th.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
Or maybe it was the 16th.

DOCTOR X713
You saw the cardiologist.

PATIENT X713
That was the 16th of December.

DOCTOR X713
You did see them.

PATIENT X713
Okay they said they were gonna set up a surgeon to call me the following week which was the 19th to the 24th and to schedule a meeting or appointment to see a surgeon general up there.  They didn't say a doctor's name.  They said they found, the cardiologist at the xxx xxx xxx xxx, they said they found a white sac in the center of my heart and it's very hard.  Now if it was cancer you would think it would be black right?

DOCTOR X713
It's a fluid collection.

PATIENT X713
But I was coughing a lot.  I had a cold at that time and I told them I says maybe that was the build-up from being, me having a cold.  Now I went to them and picked up the pain medication and they uh, also DOCTOR in xxx xxx, she's very courteous, very nice, she prescribed me a face mask for the cold weather that we're gonna be experiencing for the next seven or eight weeks or nine weeks.  They said it was gonna be a very mild winter but I believe that like the Cubs are gonna win the World Series right.  Uh I think it's gonna be a lot colder.  But anyway I see the cardiologist here in two days.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
And they were supposed to set up an appointment, like I said again, that they were gonna you know schedule appointment at the xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
I know how to get there now.

DOCTOR X713
So did you @@@?

PATIENT X713
They never contacted me.

DOCTOR X713
Really?

PATIENT X713
So this is what I'm gonna tell them Friday I'm gonna tell the you know don't call me up here once a week or twice a week cause I hate that commute.  That's very, very stressful.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
Cause I gotta watch my back most of the time and a lot of game bangers out by the bus terminal while I lived in the Heights and I probably could @@@ once before.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
And I'm kind of worried about that so I been seeing doctors down at xxx xxx and uh now I found out that uh I can't see them anymore because I got the Aetna Better Health Insurance through Medicaid.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
The Welfare Department at xxx xxx and they says the doctors won't accept it no more but I was seeing this doctor up there on my back muscle.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
He was working it back in.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
And for two days I felt great, like normal you know.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
And then it popped out again and this feels like I'm grinding against my shoulder blade it goes down.  I don't know, what's that called, something like deviates something like that but the bone that goes in your shoulder down to your ribs.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
And also I found out he told me after they took like ten x-rays they said that they took part of your muscle out in your back.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
And part of your rib to get to your lung.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X713
And they didn't tell me that you know when I came to in ICU.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
Ten hours after operation.

DOCTOR X713
Hmm, okay.

PATIENT X713
So that's probably why the muscle would not work back up.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.  Alright so.

PATIENT X713
It's probably gonna be like that the rest of my life.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.

PATIENT X713
Plus the doctor in the Heights, I don't think she had any uh really clearance to say it but she says go up there and file for pension.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
Now I know and you know and people that have filed for a pension because I feel like the doctors, when they turn me on my side real quick, that's when the muscle dropped.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
And it hasn't worked itself back up yet.

DOCTOR X713
Had you had physical therapy?

PATIENT X713
No I was getting physical therapy by DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X713
Why don't we try physical therapy here?

PATIENT X713
Huh.

DOCTOR X713
And I'm glad they gave you some pain patches @@@.

PATIENT X713
Well he's a pain specialist and he's one of the best they got here in Illinois okay.

DOCTOR X713
Alright yeah.

PATIENT X713
That's why I went to go see him.  

DOCTOR X713
So.

PATIENT X713
But I wondered if I could pick up some Lidoderm patches.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
Which will help me a lot because it helps me with my movement in my middle lateral flexion and some Absorbase that's right over here.  That's for dry skin and I'm running out and I take a shower twice a day and I put that on because I'm starting to itch and I'm running low so I only use it three, four times a week.  But when I don't apply it, it's a topical cream so to speak and it's, I don't feel like itching my legs.

DOCTOR X713
Hmm.

PATIENT X713
Now I got a vein that goes.

DOCTOR X713
How did you find these doctors?

PATIENT X713
He was referred to me by uh DOCTOR and DOCTOR was referred to me by uh a doctor over would accept Aetna Better Health.

DOCTOR X713
Okay it was through your insurance.

PATIENT X713
And my insurance yeah.  Another rag head.

DOCTOR X713
Okay so this is not VA then?

PATIENT X713
Huh?

DOCTOR X713
This not VA doctors?

PATIENT X713
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
His name is on the back here.

DOCTOR X713
Okay cause right now I think you're.

PATIENT X713
I know, I know.

DOCTOR X713
You probably have too many doctors.

PATIENT X713
You probably feel that.

DOCTOR X713
It's gotten confusing.

PATIENT X713
Now I can't see him no more.

DOCTOR X713
Okay you can't see them anymore.

PATIENT X713
And I called the Aetna Better Health.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.  But it’s okay you can still come here and.

PATIENT X713
Cause so can I get the patches today?

DOCTOR X713
Uh let me ask DOCTOR okay.

PATIENT X713
Okay and then uh if you can get approval for that, I'm sorry, uh and have them maybe ship them out to my address once a month.

DOCTOR X713
@@@.

PATIENT X713
The only reason.

DOCTOR X713
@@@ you're on hydrocodone, do you have enough of that?

PATIENT X713
Well I ran out four or five days ago and I've been in extreme pain.

DOCTOR X713
Okay you ran out of that.

PATIENT X713
I been taking ibuprofen but that's nothing, it's like taking an aspirin.

DOCTOR X713
I'll @@@ and I'll come back alright.  Your blood pressure's a little high today.

PATIENT X713
But DOCTOR at xxx xxx ordered 120 doses.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
Every two weeks.  Now the pharmacist over here says it would be for 20 days because I don't want you to take more than six a day so six times ten is 60 and ten times, six times ten is 60 again so that's 20 days.

DOCTOR X713
The new dose is.

PATIENT X713
And I eat a lot when I take this medication because it tends to make me nauseous if I don't.  And I don't like to drink milk too much cause it stops me up, plugs me up so to speak.  And I take my Docusate which is a stool softener.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.  Okay.  Alright so what did Oncology say actually?

PATIENT X713
Okay now the doctor in xxx xxx wants me to make an appointment for Oncology Department.  

DOCTOR X713
Oncology.  You saw them here.

PATIENT X713
Oh that was the cardiologist.  Is that the same thing?

DOCTOR X713
No.  You also saw Oncology in November alright.

PATIENT X713
Okay.

DOCTOR X713
So the good news is.

PATIENT X713
It didn't spread.

DOCTOR X713
Yes.  But then.

PATIENT X713
Because they did a CAT scan.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.

PATIENT X713
And they told me yeah.

DOCTOR X713
But then um there's that fluid collection.

PATIENT X713
Yeah.

DOCTOR X713
Are you feeling a lot better?

PATIENT X713
Could they take a CAT scan today or tomorrow or Friday?

DOCTOR X713
No they already took a CAT scan, it's already @@@.

PATIENT X713
Yeah I mean.

DOCTOR X713
Cause they referred you to the surgeons.  You know the most important thing right now going on?

PATIENT X713
Who?

DOCTOR X713
You know the most important thing right now?  What do you think it is?

PATIENT X713
Smoking.

DOCTOR X713
Yes.  I'm very, very concerned.

PATIENT X713
Yeah.  I believe you.

DOCTOR X713
Do you still have these uh gums or lozenges?

PATIENT X713
What the lozenges?

DOCTOR X713
Like candies or gums, nicotine gums.

PATIENT X713
The gum helps me.

DOCTOR X713
You have that on there?

PATIENT X713
Yeah.  I got uh a couple of boxes at the house.

DOCTOR X713
Well when do you feel anxious?

PATIENT X713
When I.

DOCTOR X713
Well why don't we give you like medicine for anxiety so that you could take that instead of smoking?

PATIENT X713
That might help me.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.

PATIENT X713
Yeah.

DOCTOR X713
Cause I.

PATIENT X713
Other than the Xanax.

DOCTOR X713
I'm so concerned that you're still smoking.

PATIENT X713
Yeah.  Well I'm not smoking that much anymore now.

DOCTOR X713
No it doesn't matter.

PATIENT X713
Right.

DOCTOR X713
It doesn't matter.

PATIENT X713
Right.  One cigarette is worse than.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.

PATIENT X713
Uh no cigarette.

DOCTOR X713
Definitely.  So um you've gone through a lot right now but I don't want you to go through this again alright.

PATIENT X713
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR X713
It's really serious.

PATIENT X713
Is there any possible way that I could transfer out to xxx, Oregon?

DOCTOR X713
You want to move there?

PATIENT X713
Like April 1st or at least by May 1st.

DOCTOR X713
Are you planning to move there?

PATIENT X713
Yeah.

DOCTOR X713
I mean that's possible @@@.

PATIENT X713
Cause the weather over there, it rains a lot but that's good for me though.

DOCTOR X713
Okay well it's up to you.

PATIENT X713
There's more condensation.

DOCTOR X713
It's up to you if you want to live in Oregon.

PATIENT X713
I mean if I pass away I'll be around my brother.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah and they have VAs over there you know.

PATIENT X713
And you know last time I went in the @@@ I mean conditional fit.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
Because I thought you know.

DOCTOR X713
So when do you think you're gonna move if you ever?

PATIENT X713
Well if I can get a clearance from the cardiologist or the surgeon over at xxx xxx to move out there and then register with the VA Hospital in xxx, Oregon.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
Uh.

DOCTOR X713
But pretty soon.

PATIENT X713
If worst come to worst they'll probably have to use a laser to cut that center of that white sac out.

DOCTOR X713
White sac right.  So I mean.

PATIENT X713
And I'm not afraid of the surgery.

DOCTOR X713
Do you want to complete your, do that here and then move to Oregon or do you want it at that location?

PATIENT X713
It's gonna take about six months to a year.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh but you wanted to get that done in Oregon.

PATIENT X713
Right, right, right.  Cause I've been saving up some money you know and uh.

DOCTOR X713
So you're planning to move pretty soon.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
If it wasn't for my cat I'd have been dead a long time ago.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah all the VA's have access to your information.

PATIENT X713
Right and then.

DOCTOR X713
And then.

PATIENT X713
Like they got a bus that leaves the town, it's high up in the mountains.

DOCTOR X713

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:12  DOCTOR IN:  63:24)

DOCTOR X713

Oh okay.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.

PATIENT X713
Lidocaine, is that like in a blue box or?

DOCTOR X713
I don't know but it's the same thing as the Lidoderm patches, it's that that one's in a patch form and this is in the ointment.

PATIENT X713
Okay right, right, right.

DOCTOR X713

PATIENT X713
Right 12 hours take it off.

DOCTOR X713
Yeah.  The ointment you have to make sure that you're putting it on the, like right amount.

PATIENT X713
Right.

DOCTOR X713
And you're not overdosing yourself.

PATIENT X713
Okay so it's not a thin coating it's enough to.

DOCTOR X713
You just put a very thin coat.

PATIENT X713
Okay a thin coat.

DOCTOR X713
Alright.

PATIENT X713
Yeah cause I was doing that with the other medicated cream and it was burning my back for days.

DOCTOR X713
Oh the capsaicin.

PATIENT X713
Oh that was burning me too much.

DOCTOR X713
Okay we'll stop that then.  It wasn't helping with the pain at all?

PATIENT X713
No, it was just burning me.  I couldn't sleep at night and I couldn't uh.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
Move around.  They said well after you take it for a week it'd be alright.

DOCTOR X713
Okay.

PATIENT X713
But I don't want to be in pain, on fire so to speak, for a week.

DOCTOR X713
Uh-huh.  And then you know we're gonna stop the Vicodin, the hydrocodone and then we're gonna start you on something stronger okay.  So I want you to see, I want you to come back in a month to get a refill on that.

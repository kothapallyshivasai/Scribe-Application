Okay.

But in March I had this feeling in here.

Chest pain?

Not a pain, it was like um I think you better take me to the Emergency Room kind.

DOCTOR X357:
You did.

PATIENT X357:
I did.

DOCTOR X357:
Did they admit you?  Did they send.

PATIENT X357:
They did.

DOCTOR X357:
Send you up to the hospital?

PATIENT X357:
I saw them there.  No they checked me and I think they hooked me up to whatever they do when they can get your heart.

DOCTOR X357:
In March?

PATIENT X357:
I believe it was, March, April it should be.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay you said you had pain that night, describe it.  How'd they treat you?

PATIENT X357:
Yeah and I didn't know why and since then I had it once.  About three days ago I woke up in the morning but I think it's something to do with my sinuses, I swear.

DOCTOR X357:
Hmm.

PATIENT X357:
When they're draining, I woke up right out of a dead sleep with a quick, went away and I'm fine.

DOCTOR X357:
Do you feel like your heart is racing yeah.

PATIENT X357:

DOCTOR X357:
Possibly, it could be.  Um tell me how long does it last?

PATIENT X357:
Not long.

DOCTOR X357:
Not long.

PATIENT X357:
Uh-uh.

DOCTOR X357:
Just seconds.  No pain associated with it?  No pain going down the arm or like the jaw, anything like that?  No okay, @@@.

PATIENT X357:
Sure.

DOCTOR X357:
The breast @@@.

PATIENT X357:
And they hooked me up to whatever they hook you up to and they said.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
Everything looked fine.

DOCTOR X357:
Did they send home.

PATIENT X357:

DOCTOR X357:
Did they send you home?

PATIENT X357:

DOCTOR X357:
Did they send you home with a device or not?

PATIENT X357:
No.  But I was here.

DOCTOR X357:
Right.

PATIENT X357:
Whatever they hooked here, they put something on your finger and watched it.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh a pulse ox?

PATIENT X357:
Probably.  I was here, they waited two, three hours and said everything's fine.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
I guess they could tell.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah did they and they said no more caffeine and take deep breaths, did that help?

PATIENT X357:
I don't.

DOCTOR X357:
No, not really.

PATIENT X357:
I had a cup of coffee today.  Here's what I'll tell you, what I really need from you today is something for heartburn cause it's driving me crazy.

DOCTOR X357:
Do you think you have heartburn every day?

PATIENT X357:
Okay here's what I ate last night for dinner cause I didn't eat nothing since 6 o'clock because of the blood tests, I had three bottles of Budweiser cause somebody stopped over but wait.

DOCTOR X357:
Three bottles goodness.

PATIENT X357:
Well I had friends stop over and that's not a lot.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh it's not.

PATIENT X357:
Not really I mean.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh, not for you.

PATIENT X357:
Yeah I won't have another drink now until whatever.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh goodness.  Alright go on.

PATIENT X357:
I ate spaghetti with a salad.

DOCTOR X357:
That's the spaghetti sauce would do it.

PATIENT X357:
It's really, very mild.

DOCTOR X357:
Tomatoes.

PATIENT X357:
I didn't like, I'm gonna tell you, I didn't have heartburn.

DOCTOR X357:
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X357:
But I didn't eat nothing.  Got up this morning, all I had was water.  I just had breakfast here, two scrambled eggs.

DOCTOR X357:
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X357:
Toast with jelly and corn beef hash.  Why?  What is it?

DOCTOR X357:
Did you get @@@ with the corn beef?

PATIENT X357:
No, what's with the deal?  What's with the heartburn?

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
And then some night I'll, I'll deliberately sit up straight, I'll want to lay down but I won't cause I read an article you know if you eat and lay down right away well that could.

DOCTOR X357:
Exactly.  When did you start having heartburn?

PATIENT X357:
I thought it was.  In the last two years it's just been terrible.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.  And every day or just intermittently or with certain foods?

PATIENT X357:
Every day sometimes so I've been taking um.

DOCTOR X357:
Zantac or Tums?  You been taking Tums?

PATIENT X357:
Tums.  Cause one of the doctors here prescribed me, I was taking omeprazole.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
But he said quit taking it.

DOCTOR X357:
Why?

PATIENT X357:
Cause it gave me pneumonia.  That's what he said so.

DOCTOR X357:
You've been taking ranitidine?

PATIENT X357:
I took it.

DOCTOR X357:
Twice a day.

PATIENT X357:
It did not help, ranitidine.  So I did try uh Pepcid, I don't know what's in Pepcid.

DOCTOR X357:
It's the same thing as omeprazole.

PATIENT X357:
So why won't that give me.

DOCTOR X357:
It will.  Long term products will do it but if you're having heartburn now, okay so in a way that is something good right.  Risks of getting daily heartburn right, you're eroding the lining right.

PATIENT X357:
I hope.

DOCTOR X357:
Your esophagus, you can get xxx's that leads to cancer.  You need to a) be on the right diet, doing all the right stuff.  We call it lifestyle modification and you need to be on medicine.  With time it might get better if you don't have to be @@@.  What he's talking about is over the years, over the years @@@.

PATIENT X357:
Well they had prescribed up to three, four years ago for me.  I took it, I quit, it came back.  I took it, I quit taking it, it came back.  I took it, it quit.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
So how long would you recommend I should stay on this I mean is it gonna be forever?

DOCTOR X357:
No, let's try, let's try both, let's try you know cutting down on the spaghetti, cutting down on the mints, the citrus stuff.

PATIENT X357:
I'm a V8 juice guy every morning, will that bother you?

DOCTOR X357:
@@@ we'll get it.  It has tomato.

PATIENT X357:
Okay I mean, yeah.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah. Yes.

PATIENT X357:
The tomato juice but I've been drinking it for 30 years every day a glass of V8 juice.

DOCTOR X357:
Does it give you heartburn right after you drink it?

PATIENT X357:
Nope.

DOCTOR X357:
Well you're probably good.  Then when do get @@@?

PATIENT X357:
I feel I do and my coffee I take it two cups in the morning, that's it.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay uh you need to cut it down to one cup yeah see if it does make a difference.  But I can definitely put you back on the omeprazole, did it work?

PATIENT X357:
Yeah.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah so we'll do it.

PATIENT X357:
And what would be the ranitidine, what's the difference?

DOCTOR X357:
It's the same thing.  It's just; it works on different pathways to slow down the acid production in your stomach.  So both of it, the PPI, the omeprazole works better.  Ranitidine, if it works at all, it works a little bit faster but omeprazole over the long term it works better.

PATIENT X357:
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X357:
What other medicines do you need?  Do you need the nasal spray?

PATIENT X357:
The doctor still has me on that, the ENT he's got it.

DOCTOR X357:
Good.

PATIENT X357:
I got it, I've been using that.

DOCTOR X357:
So just two sprays right, do you use that?

PATIENT X357:
One.

DOCTOR X357:
Just one, the flunisolide or the sodium chloride?

PATIENT X357:
Oh okay so flunisolide is the spray, the sodium chloride is a rinse.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X357:
I got it, that's fine.

DOCTOR X357:
You got those okay and then what do you take the sildenafil for, oh erectile dysfunction.

PATIENT X357:
How much?

DOCTOR X357:
Um erectile dysfunction you take.

PATIENT X357:
I haven't had that.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.

PATIENT X357:
But if you could prescribe it I'll use it.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.  What are the other medicines that you're taking do you know?  Over-the-counter or anything else?

PATIENT X357:
@@@, nope, nope, nope, nope.

DOCTOR X357:
Nothing else, so just the heartburn huh?

PATIENT X357:
Yeah that's just the only thing.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.  How's your psoriasis?

PATIENT X357:
Okay, not a problem, it's uh you know.

DOCTOR X357:
Good.

PATIENT X357:
So they had me come and see you because of the fact that of the issue I had with uh.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah follow-up.

PATIENT X357:
Just the earlier problems are normal.

DOCTOR X357:
That's fine you can keep this one and we'll just count this as a routine check-up.  You're not @@@ okay.

PATIENT X357:
Okay.

DOCTOR X357:
If you had another episode I wonder if I should send you home with a Holter, set you up with a Holter monitor.

PATIENT X357:
What's that?

DOCTOR X357:
It's uh; it's also like a device where you go home with it.  You pick it up downstairs, go home with it.  They monitor your electrical activity for 24 hours.  The next day you come back and you return it, they record all of your things and um if there's any abnormalities I would let you know.

PATIENT X357:
Okay.

DOCTOR X357:
You said, the first thing you said this happened once and then it happened again two days ago.  Did it happen right after you drank caffeine?

PATIENT X357:
I was sleeping.

DOCTOR X357:
And you were sleeping and @@@ it just woke you up?

PATIENT X357:
I don't know what woke me up.

DOCTOR X357:
Or this one woke you up?

PATIENT X357:
This one woke me up it was just a quick one.

DOCTOR X357:
Alright.

PATIENT X357:
But you know I thought they had me down as agoraphobia but I suffer from anxiety.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
They just switched the classification I don't know but that's one.

DOCTOR X357:
Did you?  Are you on any medicines for anxiety?

PATIENT X357:
They were giving me uh for years I took uh Valium I'm off it now.  Then they were giving me, they have me on nothing right now.  I've been doing more uh, I see him the end of this month uh, Ultraline I think they had me on.

DOCTOR X357:
Sertraline yeah.

PATIENT X357:
Yeah.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah previously.

PATIENT X357:
I had taken it and he recommended trying to do what I'm doing.  I've been doing more therapy when I go and come.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh okay.

PATIENT X357:
I have it every Sunday when I go to church.  I can get it, I get worked up because all of those people.

DOCTOR X357:
Were you anxious when this happened?

PATIENT X357:
I was sleeping.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
I could of been dreaming, I don't know.

DOCTOR X357:
That's right, @@@.

PATIENT X357:
That I don't know, whatever.

DOCTOR X357:
Alright so.

PATIENT X357:
So the omeprazole will be fine, it's only on the long term view okay.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.  Like I said I mean you stop if it's well controlled but obviously you're not controlled if you're having it every day.

PATIENT X357:
Yeah it could happen you know. 

DOCTOR X357:
Right.

PATIENT X357:
And there's sometimes even after I make a bowel movement.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
I get heartburn.

DOCTOR X357:
Any belly pain?

PATIENT X357:
No.  What does that tell you?

DOCTOR X357:

PATIENT X357:
It's craziness.

DOCTOR X357:
Um, @@@ okay.  Lightheadedness, dizziness?

PATIENT X357:
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.

PATIENT X357:
I had my eye exam.

DOCTOR X357:
You did good.

PATIENT X357:
And she told me that, the doctor a female doctor when I say she, I should say the doctor, she found a wiggly spot in one of my eyes but she said, you got high blood pressure, I said not yet well she said usually this would be a spot on both sides so she just said remember what I said and I thought that was strange but.

DOCTOR X357:
Umm.  Alright.  Any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands or anything?

PATIENT X357:
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.

PATIENT X357:
The other day I did wake up but I never had this, maybe just never, right here, a cramp so bad I wasn't able to sleep, right here.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
My wife gets them all the time but she said it's because she don't eat the, I'm always eating bananas.  She said maybe I'm low on potassium.

DOCTOR X357:
Last time you were tested its fine.

PATIENT X357:
That's what I thought.

DOCTOR X357:
Um.

PATIENT X357:
That could of just been something.

DOCTOR X357:
Right.  Do you have varicose veins?

PATIENT X357:
Oh yeah and I have them.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
Look at this yeah.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah there you go, must be at that place.

PATIENT X357:
Right here.

DOCTOR X357:
I'll bet yeah.

PATIENT X357:
I never have a @@@ though.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh.

PATIENT X357:
They don't hurt me.

DOCTOR X357:
Do you think they got bigger?  @@@.

PATIENT X357:
Probably.

DOCTOR X357:
Sometimes with enlargement or worsening varicose veins can do that.

PATIENT X357:
And I walk.

DOCTOR X357:
Good.  Stay hydrated, stay hydrated.

PATIENT X357:
I do.

DOCTOR X357:
Good.  Are your immunizations up-to-date?

PATIENT X357:
I think.

DOCTOR X357:
Flu shot last year?  Pneumonia vaccine, tetanus?

PATIENT X357:
Pneumonia uh you gave me the uh shingles.

DOCTOR X357:
Good.

PATIENT X357:
The pneumonia.

DOCTOR X357:
@@@.

PATIENT X357:
I don't either.  The pneumonia shot.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
I had uh four or five years ago.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.

PATIENT X357:
Which I thought was early.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah sometimes um @@@.

PATIENT X357:
They made a mistake on my age.

DOCTOR X357:
@@@.

PATIENT X357:
I'm just now 63.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh okay.

PATIENT X357:
They put it, but it should've been after.  So whenever you think it's time for another one.

DOCTOR X357:
65 for that one.  Yeah okay.  Any coughing, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss?  Say ah.

PATIENT X357:
Ah.

DOCTOR X357:
How's your sinus pressure, now today it's better?  Pain?  Pain?

PATIENT X357:
Uh-huh, @@@.

DOCTOR X357:
Here?  Okay, okay.

PATIENT X357:
Oh God.

DOCTOR X357:
That's okay yeah.  But not any today?

PATIENT X357:
A little today.  At least today I'd say I've had it just kind of and I don't know what to take for it so I end up taking a Tylenol.

DOCTOR X357:
You can take Tylenol yeah.

PATIENT X357:
Does it have to be sinus or could it just be Tylenol pain relief?

DOCTOR X357:
Uh sometimes sinus would be better for a different kind of pain there, in addition to the Tylenol especially with that.  Any headaches up in front here?

PATIENT X357:
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.  Chest pain, shortness of breath?  Your heart sounds fine.  Deep breaths in and out, deep breath, deep breath again.  Good.  One more, great, you're not hyperventilating are you?

PATIENT X357:
I don't think so.

DOCTOR X357:
Pain?

PATIENT X357:
No.

DOCTOR X357:
Why do you have this divot here?

PATIENT X357:
What's a divot?

DOCTOR X357:
Oh no here it's going away.  Any pain?

PATIENT X357:
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X357:
Go ahead and lay back.  Good.  No urinary symptoms or like?

PATIENT X357:
Uh the urinary deal I've noticed a change but it's uh.

DOCTOR X357:
Uh-huh, like frequency, going a lot at night?

PATIENT X357:
After a couple bottles of Bud Light I have to go but I don't go a lot at night.  I do drink a little sip of water at night.

DOCTOR X357:
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X357:
But like before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X357:
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X357:
But the first thing in the morning, when I get up, I have to go to the washroom.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.  Any accidents?  Incontinence?

PATIENT X357:
Sometimes and but I don't think, it doesn't want to notify me, I just go on my own now at home.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh.

PATIENT X357:
Does that make sense?

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
Is that normal?

DOCTOR X357:
Do you have an enlarged prostate or no?

PATIENT X357:
I, how would I know?

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.  But you've never been to the urologist?  Nobody's ever told you?

PATIENT X357:
Oh I've been to a urologist.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah did they say anything, go ahead move your.

PATIENT X357:
But I haven't been to one in five years.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay.

PATIENT X357:
You know.

DOCTOR X357:
Any like, any change in your urinary symptoms?

PATIENT X357:
As to?

DOCTOR X357:
Like worsening, going more often, blood in your urine?

PATIENT X357:
I go more often and it seems like I really gotta you know, it’s like, how can I explain it.

DOCTOR X357:
Urge?

PATIENT X357:
The urge, but there ain’t that much water.

DOCTOR X357:
Right okay.

PATIENT X357:
Is that normal?

DOCTOR X357:
Uh, depends if you have an enlarged prostate that can happen and with older, again as you get older um that can happen.  Your prostate starts growing more because of age um.  Let me check your PSA.

PATIENT X357:
I know you give me that every year and it's been the same.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.  I mean I don't think it's ever been high @@@.

PATIENT X357:
Now if I don't drink liquids I'm fine.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh okay.  So it's related to the amount of water that you take?

PATIENT X357:
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah your PSA last year, six months ago was fine.

PATIENT X357:
I uh can hold the water longer than I can hold a cup of coffee though.

DOCTOR X357:
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X357:
Does that make sense?

DOCTOR X357:
Makes sense cause there's a diuretic effect in caffeine, makes you want to go a lot more.

PATIENT X357:
Just the urgency is there.  It never used to be before.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh you're fine um.  What else, okay so @@@ I'm sorry you got it, yeah 65 is there.  Your colonoscopy is just fine.  Stress test is good.  Were you ever a smoker?

PATIENT X357:
Oh in the past yes.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.  Okay at 65 we check an ultrasound just to make sure that your blood vessels are okay.

PATIENT X357:
Okay.

DOCTOR X357:
So next time we'll check that out.  Um are you taking anything over-the-counter?

PATIENT X357:
For?

DOCTOR X357:
Anything like herbal medicines, things like that?

PATIENT X357:
No if I get sinus whatever, I take a Tylenol but um or I take @@@ or I'll take a xxxadryl just to, I don't know I think they all do the same thing.

DOCTOR X357:
Oh yeah.  The next time you get labs in six months you'll see me.

PATIENT X357:
Okay.

DOCTOR X357:
Um before that you know same thing, same drill today, you get labs before you see me, that way I can go over your results with you um and um then I can get yeah.  You take @@@, this is something new that you take @@@.

PATIENT X357:
I don't care, I don't care.  That's it.  They were giving them out free; I just didn't want to stop before.  I think the stigma of an insurance company finding out, I'll be on it, @@@.  I just never did it before because I could be honest with you; I have nothing to hide for any reason but the least you tell an insurance company the better you are.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
I've been talking car insurance, life insurance, health insurance; I just think it's a lot of.

DOCTOR X357:
Right, okay well.

PATIENT X357:
A lot of hooey.

DOCTOR X357:
I see yeah.

PATIENT X357:
That's probably why I never did it before.  I think a lot of people don't do it cause they're afraid the insurance companies if you're out there looking for help they'll say well why did you get an HIV test, is that kind of a question, no.  I mean they may say well why did you get, 20 years ago they might of asked you.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
But now I know, I think it's pretty prevalent that people get them.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.  Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
Am I the only one that would ask that question?

DOCTOR X357:
I don't think it is.

PATIENT X357:
No but I mean that kind of response, how does everybody?

DOCTOR X357:
I mean everybody no, it's not, I mean I've had the same partner for you know three years, why would I need one so you say no.

PATIENT X357:
But I mean what they're saying is because.

DOCTOR X357:
Insurance you think?

PATIENT X357:
I think the government's too nosey on everything.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah, probably, probably.

PATIENT X357:
I just, I could go into stories I should think.  I think they know way too much now.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
I'm not on Facebook.  I don't think I ever will be cause if I want to talk to you I'll call you and if I want to tell you that I won the lottery, I certainly ain't gonna put it on Facebook.

DOCTOR X357:
Right, why would you okay.

PATIENT X357:
People just say that's my age and I said no but I can't believe that I mean millions of people sit there and waste there, idle their time away.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.

PATIENT X357:
And what do I do, I might watch TV, Jeopardy, who knows.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah.  So um well I'll give you the omeprazole.  Do you want to pick it up or do you want me to send it to you?

PATIENT X357:
You could send it to me, cause if I pick it up I think it'll be a.

DOCTOR X357:
Longer wait cool, alright.  And your labs before you see me, your lipids um with the exception of your HDL it was fine.

PATIENT X357:
What's the HDL?

DOCTOR X357:
The HDL is your protective cholesterol, as we call it.  It's your good cholesterol that helps you protect against heart attacks and strokes and it's 26.  Sometimes that can be hereditary, from your family it runs low um but sometimes you know um you know, it’s not.  It doesn't affect it.  It's almost like it @@@.  A lot of its genetics.  Sometimes it can be brought up by exercising more.  The treadmill, you're walking around, it can bring it up okay.  Um and if it's persistently low we can talk about putting you on something called niacin but I think exercise is better, it can help.  It is 26. I think in the past it's been that low too.

PATIENT X357:
And what should it be?

DOCTOR X357:
40.

PATIENT X357:
Oh.

DOCTOR X357:
Female it should be 50, males it should be 40.  Yours is at 26.

PATIENT X357:
Oh.

DOCTOR X357:
You know we can consider that.  Last time it was 32.

PATIENT X357:
Okay now what's my cholesterol on the whole?

DOCTOR X357:
142, which is wonderful.

PATIENT X357:
Oh.

DOCTOR X357:
It needs to be less than 200 and triglycerides you're just about where it should be, 150 and LDL which is your bad cholesterol that I want it less than 100 and yours was 86 so the only thing is that good cholesterol to lift it up if only to get that exercise.

PATIENT X357:

PATIENT X357:
And how long does the thing last or what do you do?

DOCTOR X357:
A day cause they hook you up and you go home with it um for a day.  The next day you come back.

PATIENT X357:

PATIENT X357:
So I know what I'm walking around with.

DOCTOR X357:
Yeah just for one day and um it's just to check you out just when you can.  I put in the order so I'll let my nurse know uh.  If this can be hooked up today it would be great then you wouldn't have to make a trip back.  So you wear it for a day, you come back and you return it to the same place you got it.

PATIENT X357:
Okay.

DOCTOR X357:
And then the cardiologist will then look at it and at the end if everything's okay we've got this before it was normal.

PATIENT X357:
Okay.

DOCTOR X357:
So that we can rule out bad stuff like arrhythmia.

PATIENT X357:
Okay.

DOCTOR X357:
I mean we can, I can very easily attribute that to anxiety but then what if it's not so let's rule out the bad stuff.

PATIENT X357:
Alright.

DOCTOR X357:
And if it's ruled out then I can say hey it's probably anxiety.

PATIENT X357:

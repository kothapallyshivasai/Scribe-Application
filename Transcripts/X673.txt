DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673

DOCTOR X673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X673
But they never did send it to me.

DOCTOR X673
Uh-huh.

Short-winded at the top of the steps but nothing unusual.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X673

And then sometime I used to bend over and uh get a little dizzy.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
So but I feel a lot better though.  I have more confidence in myself that I'm gonna last but I think one or two times I did have a little.

SECOND PERSON X673
A fainting spell.

PATIENT X673
I had a fainting spell and I was down on the floor before I had the operation and @@@ thing they is picking me up.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  But that was before the operation?

PATIENT X673
That's before the operation.

DOCTOR X673
Okay and you haven't had any complications like that since?

PATIENT X673
No.

DOCTOR X673
Good.  Okay, right.  Um tell me more about the cough you've been having.

PATIENT X673
At nighttime it's like I cough and one time they give me some medicine.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
But @@@, you know when I was in the hospital and uh that really helps a lot.

DOCTOR X673
Do you remember what medication it was?

PATIENT X673
No I don't.

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@.

PATIENT X673
That's only while I was in the hospital but they had given something for the @@@.  You know it's like you want to cough, cough @@@ little tickle in your throat.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
And but now most time I just gets a little hacking cough.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
Sometime I can cough up something, sometime I don't.  They want to give me cough syrup here.  The one I get was better than the one I get at Walgreens.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
So I have, uh I @@@ about it but they haven't been sending it to me.

DOCTOR X673
Okay, I'll check it, we can see and maybe you can pick it up here today.

PATIENT X673
I need it yeah.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Um tell me a little more about that cough.  Do you get it only at night?

PATIENT X673
Well mostly at night.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  And um does it wake you up from sleep?

PATIENT X673
Uh sometime it does.

DOCTOR X673
Um is it ever during the day?

PATIENT X673
No, now I do that at night.

DOCTOR X673
Okay sore throat, runny nose?

PATIENT X673
I have a runny nose, nothing else.

DOCTOR X673
Runny nose.

PATIENT X673
I'm changing @@@ I need because I be tough to get up and going to the bathroom and I be in the bathroom you know @@@ kind of thing but I check myself and I got stop it before it run down.  @@@ when I had that asthma medicine with me.  What's that medicine I was taking?  Uh sinus.

SECOND PERSON X673
Yes sinus medicine.

PATIENT X673
Sinus.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  

PATIENT X673
But the @@@ said they gonna mail it to me but they never did send it.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Was it called loratadine for your runny nose?

SECOND PERSON X673
Loratadine, I think it was.

PATIENT X673
Yeah.

DOCTOR X673
And then did you have guaifenesin?

SECOND PERSON X673
What's that?

PATIENT X673
@@@.

DOCTOR X673
But I'm thinking your runny nose is probably causing the cough. So we can try the loratadine, see if that helps and then if it's not helping we can give you something else for the cough.  I mean there's a lot of things that can cause a cough.

SECOND PERSON X673
He's been taking that but he still has the cough.

DOCTOR X673
Oh even with the loratadine?  Okay.

SECOND PERSON X673
It didn't stop the runny nose or anything.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Okay.  

PATIENT X673
That nose is bad sometime.

DOCTOR X673
And fevers or chills?

PATIENT X673
No.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Um the cough was going on for how long now?

PATIENT X673
Oh quite a while it seems.  It looks like it'll go from summer to winter.  From summer to winter but sometimes like it @@@ up, well with some of the medicine I get, I get cough syrup and uh that what you call that?  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X673
No good stuff.

DOCTOR X673
Oh the @@@?

SECOND PERSON X673

PATIENT X673
Especially at nighttime, I took it when I lay down.

DOCTOR X673

SECOND PERSON X673

SECOND PERSON X673

SECOND PERSON X673

DOCTOR X673
The loratadine for allergies?

PATIENT X673

SECOND PERSON X673

DOCTOR X673
Okay simvastatin for cholesterol.

PATIENT X673

DOCTOR X673
Okay are you taking the potassium supplements?

SECOND PERSON X673
What's that?

DOCTOR X673
Potassium supplements?

SECOND PERSON X673
Oh what do we do with that?

DOCTOR X673
Oh it's just a supplement.  People who are on Lasix sometimes their potassium can go low.

SECOND PERSON X673
I don't think so.

PATIENT X673
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X673
If it's up there, he's taking it uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
Okay and terazosin for your prostate?

PATIENT X673
That's that little pill ain't it?

SECOND PERSON X673
Yes, okay.

DOCTOR X673
And then if you get chest pain they give you something under the tongue @@@.

SECOND PERSON X673
No he don't take that anymore.  Since he had the operation he don't take that.

DOCTOR X673
Okay sure.  You never had to use it?

SECOND PERSON X673
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X673
Good.  Do you need any refills on any other medications today?

SECOND PERSON X673
Yeah we @@@ all of them.

DOCTOR X673
Okay um your prostate level was high I'm looking at.  Has he, are you being followed in the Urinary Clinic?  @@@ you just saw them.

PATIENT X673
Uh yesterday it was good @@@.

DOCTOR X673
Do you have a history of prostate cancer?

PATIENT X673
No they said the prostate cancer in the beginning.

SECOND PERSON X673
It was enlarged.

PATIENT X673
It's enlarged prostate.

DOCTOR X673
It's enlarged and they also said you've had a history of prostate cancer?

PATIENT X673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
Back in 1999.

PATIENT X673
They actually diagnosed it, it was first diagnosed with cancer they said it was enlarged, @@@ if it'd been cancer I'd have been dead by now.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Well they asked you if you wanted to get treated but you decided you would just wait.

SECOND PERSON X673
I think he went on pills for that.

DOCTOR X673
Well they gave him pills because it's enlarged and it obstructs the urinary flow but that doesn't cure the cancer okay.

PATIENT X673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
But those are two different things.  It might be enlarged because of the cancer but your prostate does get enlarged when you age and so it obstructs of the urine and that's why they give you the medications to help you pee.

PATIENT X673
But I think they said it was too far, what's that called a PSI?

DOCTOR X673
PSA?  Yeah.

PATIENT X673
PSA.

DOCTOR X673
I'm looking at it right now.  Looks like back in about, back in 1999 it was at 4 but back in 2005 it went up to 14 and then it stayed up and down since that time, its back up to 14.  So I'd say you know you just saw them September 13th um and uh you're probably gonna go visit them soon again right?  So, that's what talk about.

PATIENT X673
Going to GU?

DOCTOR X673
GU yeah.  Something to talk about.

PATIENT X673
But you know GU um one thing I will say, just kind of, I kind of got a little disturbed one time.  Every time you go there they want to see if they can put that thing on your leg, they called it a catheter.  My urine was good.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
And uh I don't need that thing.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
And then it uh, it beginning to make the ends on the thing down there and it get so uh swinging in and out.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Let's see, let me check here, I was just wondering have you had any blood work recently?

PATIENT X673
I had some like last @@@.

DOCTOR X673
You had some in July.

PATIENT X673
Uh-huh and some before then too did we?

SECOND PERSON X673
Yes @@@.

PATIENT X673
I was here @@@.

DOCTOR X673
Did you have any more blood tests done?

PATIENT X673
Well I mean I've been coming to them for a low blood count but they said my blood count was good for a change.

DOCTOR X673
Did they check your blood then?

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@.

DOCTOR X673
@@@.  How about we check your blood count today to see how it is.

SECOND PERSON X673
We was here in September.

DOCTOR X673
Was that back in July?

PATIENT X673
In September.

SECOND PERSON X673
No, we just changed @@@ was alright.

PATIENT X673
Uh-huh.  That's been down.

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@.

DOCTOR X673
Uh it's been like four months.

SECOND PERSON X673
No it ain't that long.

PATIENT X673
Oh, seems like about.

DOCTOR X673
They might have taken blood but they were probably looking for something else.

SECOND PERSON X673
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Uh the kidney function looks okay.  I'll talk to DOCTOR and we'll what we can up with a plan, how's that sound?

PATIENT X673
That sound good.

DOCTOR X673
I don't see the cholesterol.  The last time it was checked, it was back in May and I mean it looks good.  Your LDL was 55 which is good and the total cholesterol is 119 is good okay.

SECOND PERSON X673
Alright.

DOCTOR X673
How about if you sit up here for me?  Your blood pressure looks well controlled.

PATIENT X673
You want me to take my jacket off?

DOCTOR X673
Sure.  @@@.

PATIENT X673
Oh yeah it's been the same but it's been lower ever since I've had, well even before I had the operation.

DOCTOR X673
Any @@@.

PATIENT X673
Only if it's low.

DOCTOR X673
You know I actually think that's a good range for your blood pressure, 107/60, as long as you're not feeling lightheaded or dizzy, good.

PATIENT X673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Especially because you've had heart disease before and you know the vessels are narrow in your heart.  You know the higher blood pressure is the more likely that that blood pressure is gonna cause injury to the vessels and we want to decrease that as much as you can.

SECOND PERSON X673
It's really gotten low ever since then.

DOCTOR X673
Yeah so I mean as long, 100s to 110s, that's fine for the top number.  I'm okay with that alright.

PATIENT X673
That sound good.

DOCTOR X673
Um regarding the heart, you're seeing the cardiologist too right?  Did they want to do any further work-up?

PATIENT X673
@@@ they gave me a defibrillator.

DOCTOR X673
Oh a defibrillator?

PATIENT X673
I call it a carburetor.

DOCTOR X673
I see.  But um, yeah so the reason we want to do that is because your heart pumping function is not @@@.  So usually your heart would pump about 60% of what fills, so your heart's only pumping about 20%-30%.

PATIENT X673
Lower huh.

DOCTOR X673
So it's not pumping forward as well as it should be.  You know when the heart's weak like that.

SECOND PERSON X673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
It's prone to having a lot of arrhythmias, meaning a lot of irregular beats and so those beats can sometimes be fatal, cause ventricular tachycardia and that's why they want to put in a defibrillator.

SECOND PERSON 
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
Cause it's gonna prevent, say your heart doesn't feel like an irregular rhythm, that defibrillator can shock your heart back into the right rhythm.  That's the reason they wanted to do that.

PATIENT X673
Yeah I was on, I would kind of skip the one time because I was the heart @@@ and this man he had a defibrillator.

SECOND PERSON X673
Fibrillator.

DOCTOR X673
Go on.

PATIENT X673
And uh while they was putting it in, some kind of way they punctured one of the muscles.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
And um he had had problems ever since so.

DOCTOR X673
You know everyone has different complications for the procedure and unfortunately those were his complications but usually the complications are pretty rare and that's why you should see your electrophysiologist, the cardiologist that specializes in electrical rhythms because there are people that actually, I know you're going to see DOCTOR and she's the one that specializes in that rhythm and so she would be the one to put in the procedure, she could probably tell you a little bit more about it.  I think it'd be pretty important but especially if your heart's pumping function is not good, you're more prone to having that defibrillator in.

PATIENT X673
You know sometime I would cause different rhythms when it's like I got a double beat or something.

DOCTOR X673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X673
I get that sometimes, especially if I get excited or something, you know my nerves.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
It's just like it'll beat harder then it beats kind of slower.  

DOCTOR X673
Looks like your pumping function back in 2007 was okay but because you know your heart, the hearts um I think it's the blood vessels to the heart have kind of weakened the heart so it'd be important, even though you have that CABG, the triple bypass, I think it's important to go to the cardiologist and get evaluated for that pacemaker, not pacemaker but defibrillator.

PATIENT X673
Carburetor.  

DOCTOR X673
It does both.  The defibrillator will @@@ pacemaker.

SECOND PERSON X673
Is that, it both in the one or both of them, is it two different thing @@@.

DOCTOR X673
It's actually just one device but it has, but depending on what type of leads that's put in it, it can do the function of both.  So the defibrillator has the added function of softening the heartbeat too.

PATIENT X673
How they got different @@@.  My daughter-in-law had mentioned what she an @@@ or what is it?

DOCTOR X673
Anesthesiologist.

PATIENT X673
They put you to sleep @@@.

DOCTOR X673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X673
And she says daddy, it's not a bad deal I would go for it because you might be uh, bought us some time.

DOCTOR X673
I agree you know.  Like I said you're prone, if your heart's pumping function's not there, you're prone to having an irregular rhythm and so that defibrillator can prevent that from happening.  So if it does go into irregular rhythm, it'll shock your heart back into the regular rhythm.

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@?

DOCTOR X673
No it's not gonna change that but it's gonna, it's more of preventative measure for if your heart goes into that irregular rhythm, alright.

PATIENT X673
I think uh, I think I'm gonna end up uh; I got a lot of people that are on my side for getting it so.

DOCTOR X673
So it looks like what they want to do is put you on the best medication possible um and then based on if they can put you on the best medications and then you had a couple episodes again, after they keep you on the better medications and see if your heart recovers, see if the heart pumping function recovers.  So if the heart pumping starts to recover then you might not need to have the defibrillator okay.

PATIENT X673
What kind of medicine?

DOCTOR X673
So you're on lisinopril and metoprolol which are excellent medications for the heart and if your heart is weak it's better to keep your blood pressure lower cause your heart doesn't have to work so hard against the blood pressure.

SECOND PERSON X673
Lisinopril, that's the one he take at night right?

DOCTOR X673
Uh do you take it at night?  You can take it in the morning but it's once a day.

SECOND PERSON X673
Okay.

DOCTOR X673
Okay and the metoprolol is twice a day but I think you might be on the, you're on the long-acting so you also take that once a day.

PATIENT X673
Do you think it'd be best to take it in the morning or at night?

DOCTOR X673
You know it's up to you.  I think that um, it's honestly up to you.  You could take it in the morning but you're supposed to take it at night but it's just once a day okay.

PATIENT X673
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X673
Uh I think it's at night.  How do you spell it?

DOCTOR X673
Lisinopril?

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@.

DOCTOR X673
Lisinopril.

SECOND PERSON X673
He usually takes it at night.

DOCTOR X673
That's okay.  I'm gonna take a listen to your heart okay.  Take a big deep breath in and out for me.  Good.  Have you noticed any extra swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X673
Uh sometimes.

DOCTOR X673
Sometimes, how's it look now today?

PATIENT X673
Oh well I had these socks on yesterday and today and they gave me some other socks to put on.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
And I wore these socks yesterday now it looks like I'm a little swollen today a little bit.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  For the most part they look okay right.  Is this more swollen then usual?

PATIENT X673
Uh this, it do that in the morning time very little.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.

PATIENT X673
I think those socks might help.

DOCTOR X673
Okay you wear the compression stockings?

PATIENT X673
I got some uh when I put them on it be like @@@.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  Good um.  Actually looks good.  @@@ take a look at the veins in your neck.  Okay look straight ahead.  @@@.  Let me push on your belly okay.  Good, good. Uh do you have any other questions for me or any other complaints?  @@@.

PATIENT X673
No.

DOCTOR X673
Okay.  So how about we do this, we'll put you back on the loratadine.

PATIENT X673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
you can get that today; let's see the last time you got it.  It's been a while.  Cause sometimes the lisinopril, the last time you got it was August 29th so it's been a while since you got it.  Let's see if that helps.

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@.

DOCTOR X673
@@@ sometimes you can have a cough because of the lisinopril as well but that's a good nitrate for your heart but I don't want to stop it okay.  So let's see how you do with the loratadine and then if you need something for cough we can give you like the cough medications.

PATIENT X673
That sound good.

DOCTOR X673
Sound good.  Um and then we'll go from there.

PATIENT X673
Okay.

DOCTOR X673
And then let's try to do some blood work today just so we can see how everything looks.

PATIENT X673
Alright.

DOCTOR X673
Especially since we have you on these medications I can check it and make sure your blood count's okay so that your heart's not working too hard okay and I'll be right back.  I'll go talk to DOCTOR okay.

PATIENT X673
Do you want me to put this back on?

DOCTOR X673
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X673
We have parking @@@.

DOCTOR X673
Um I can write it down for you.  I don't actually have a parking @@@.  Let me ask DOCTOR @@@.

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@ have a question you can probably have him call back.

DOCTOR X673
@@@ let me see if I can get your number.

SECOND PERSON X673
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  28:17  DOCTOR IN:  48:00)

DOCTOR X673
Hey PATIENT.  Sorry to take so long.  @@@ um looks like you might have like uh pre-diabetes from the last blood work that we had and so I think DOCTOR, who you saw last time, referred you to the Nutrition Clinic so maybe you can control this with proper nutrition instead of going on another medication.  So I think we should probably send you to the Nutrition Clinic so if you want to stop by today and just make an appointment um or just see if they can give you an appointment.

PATIENT X673
Uh.

SECOND PERSON X673
He had an appointment.

PATIENT X673
She called me alright; she sent me some diet uh.

DOCTOR X673
Perfect.

PATIENT X673
Let's see what was the name uh?

SECOND PERSON X673
@@@.

PATIENT X673
Yeah NAME.

DOCTOR X673
And then um I think your blood pressure @@@ you know you think it might be low but for someone whose heart is not functioning well you can tolerate blood pressures in like the 90s with the top number being in the 90s so I think we should increase the lisinopril um just a little bit more okay and see how you do and then have you follow up in the Cardiology Clinic where they could repeat that study that takes a look and see your heart pumping function okay.

PATIENT X673
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X673
Sound good?

PATIENT X673
Sound good.

DOCTOR X673
Alright and then um the other thing is we're just gonna repeat that blood work today just because your blood count's a little bit low so we just want to make sure that's okay.

PATIENT X673
@@@.

DOCTOR X673
Yeah.

PATIENT X673
The same.

DOCTOR X673
I know and that's just because of the kidneys, the kidneys can make it so like your blood count's high @@@ sometimes the heart's weak and it's not pumping to the kidneys as well and sometimes the kidneys are a little bit damaged so there's @@@ okay.

PATIENT X673
So I still give them blood.

DOCTOR X673
Just get some blood work today and I'll call you if any of the results are abnormal and then I'll refill that prescription for you.

PATIENT X673

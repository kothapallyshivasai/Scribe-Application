PATIENT X28
Hello DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X28
How are you?  You've had kind of an eventful @@@ since the last time I saw you.

PATIENT X28
Good.  So you read my records?

DOCTOR X28
Of course.  @@@.

PATIENT X28
That's good, good, I'm doing good.

DOCTOR X28
You had a little bit of a @@@, sorry that happened.

PATIENT X28
I'm alright.

DOCTOR X28
You were not on aspirin were you?

PATIENT X28
No.

DOCTOR X28
We do not have you on aspirin.  I wanted to make sure that we didn't.  Yeah, you weren't on the aspirin I think.  It was only like six days after I saw you.

PATIENT X28
Yeah.

DOCTOR X28
Did it just happen like that?

PATIENT X28
No actually had had happened was that.

DOCTOR X28
@@@.

PATIENT X28
I was uh playing with my grandson.

DOCTOR X28
Oh.

PATIENT X28
And I flipped backwards and I hit my head.

DOCTOR X28
Got it.

PATIENT X28
And uh.

DOCTOR X28
That makes more sense.

PATIENT X28
So I thought uh, well what the heck, you know I've hit my head many times so what's the difference.  So I went to a primary doctor outside and they gave me some painkillers and I was having some headaches on and off until one day I got out of bed and I couldn't even put my foot in my slipper.  I called here and I gave them all the information.  They tell me if that's the case come right up so when they opened my head, there was a preview.

DOCTOR X28
It was an old one.

PATIENT X28
Old one in there but uh it stopped the draining when I conked my head the headaches stopped.  @@@ drain here and a drain here and.

DOCTOR X28
What did they think the old one was from?

PATIENT X28
I have no idea, wouldn't know, you know.

DOCTOR X28
But they thought @@@.

PATIENT X28
I don't know, that's a lot of them.  @@@ it took about three or four days.  @@@.

DOCTOR X28
How are you feeling now?

PATIENT X28
I feel fine.  I feel fine.  I feel good.  Sometimes I, I don't know when I open my eyes wide open.

DOCTOR X28
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X28
I feel like I'm stretching but all in all I feel, I feel good.

DOCTOR X28
What meds are you on right now?

PATIENT X28
Medication?  Okay I have simvastatin.

DOCTOR X28
Okay.

PATIENT X28
Uh I take a vitamin.

DOCTOR X28
Vitamin D, I have you on vitamin D.

PATIENT X28
This one here was prescribed by the hospital here and I did manage to get an order for the north.

DOCTOR X28
Expired.

PATIENT X28
It expired.

DOCTOR X28
So are you taking it?

PATIENT X28
Well you have to decided uh based on my blood pressure.

DOCTOR X28
Right.  I read the note by the neurosurgeon.

PATIENT X28
Yeah.  A little bit hyper.

DOCTOR X28
Are you on it now?

PATIENT X28
No.  I haven't taken it for about maybe a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR X28
You've been out for two weeks?

PATIENT X28
Yeah I ran out.

DOCTOR X28
I see your blood pressure is not that bad.  139/73.

PATIENT X28
The nurse that comes to see me a couple of times a month.

DOCTOR X28
Yeah.

PATIENT X28
She says uh my blood pressure is perfect, 120, 123 but it's a little bit hyper sometimes, it depends on you know, I got to tell my wife not to put salt in the food.

DOCTOR X28
139/73, given your other medical problems, I'm not necessarily inclined to treat it, to be honest with you.

PATIENT X28
Okay.

DOCTOR X28
Um you have relatively normal kidney functions um, you're not a diabetic.  The last time you were here you were like 157/90.

PATIENT X28
That was before.

DOCTOR X28
Right and that is why I wanted to start it.

PATIENT X28
Everything, everything is sky-rocketing and everything.

DOCTOR X28
Probably there are probably a lot of reasons for that.

PATIENT X28
Correct, correct.

DOCTOR X28
Even if I were to start you on it, I'll do half that dose okay.  I would do the 12.5 not the 25.

PATIENT X28
Hmm.  I'm taking my blood pressure myself.

DOCTOR X28
When do you check it at home and what is it?  I'll check it again @@@.

PATIENT X28
Yeah, probably lower.  Uh sometimes like in hyper, you know 130, 120.

DOCTOR X28
130.

PATIENT X28
Yes, 130, 120, 124, sometimes lower.

DOCTOR X28
How high does it get?

PATIENT X28
Um.

DOCTOR X28
Does it ever hit the 140 range?

PATIENT X28
I think so, I think, not a lot though.

DOCTOR X28
Once, twice.

PATIENT X28
Once, twice.

DOCTOR X28
When?  After activity or?

PATIENT X28
After activity or after yelling at the kids.

DOCTOR X28
So pretty normal reasons.

PATIENT X28
Normal reasons.  But I'm pretty sure it's gonna be lower when you take it now.  I uh, I'll take the medication if I really have to but I'd rather not if I don't.

DOCTOR X28
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X28
Now the other one, the tamsulosin, I'm not taking that.

DOCTOR X28
You're not taking the tamsulosin?

PATIENT X28
No.

DOCTOR X28
You stopped taking the calcium and simvastatin?

PATIENT X28
Correct.

DOCTOR X28
Cause tamsulosin @@@ correct right?

PATIENT X28
Yeah I wasn't doing good.

DOCTOR X28
Okay.  And you've been off of that for how long?

PATIENT X28
I would say a couple of months.

DOCTOR X28
Are you still seeing @@@ for the prostate?

PATIENT X28
Yes.  They took the PSA test the other day; they gave me a blood test.

DOCTOR X28
0.35 is what it came back.

PATIENT X28
So that's good.

DOCTOR X28
Good. 

PATIENT X28
Uh.

DOCTOR X28
And you're not have, you're not having lower urinary tract symptoms?

PATIENT X28
No.

DOCTOR X28
Okay.

PATIENT X28
I do get up two, three times at night.  I hate that.

DOCTOR X28
Oh you do.

PATIENT X28
Who wouldn't?

DOCTOR X28
Who wouldn't I agree.  I didn't know you were getting up at night.

PATIENT X28
Yeah I did get up.  I feel the pressure you know and I don't have to urinate a lot but, the pressure is there.  It's hard to take a nap in the afternoon to relax.

DOCTOR X28
(Doctor working on computer)  Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date but did you get a flu shot this year?

PATIENT X28
Uh no, I'm gonna wait on that.

DOCTOR X28
You don't want that then?

PATIENT X28
Uh no, no.

DOCTOR X28
Why not?

PATIENT X28
Well I have mixed reasons.  Every time I take one, I catch a cold.

DOCTOR X28
Okay.

PATIENT X28
And with my uh @@@ I like to know like, play it cool, or easy.  I don't want to, I know of course you know after these, is this gonna be normal for me, is something gonna change?

DOCTOR X28
What over @@@.

PATIENT X28
With the @@@.

DOCTOR X28
But that happened a while ago.

PATIENT X28
It's going on, over 3 1/2 months.

DOCTOR X28
@@@.

PATIENT X28
So it should be okay.

DOCTOR X28
It should start cooling down again.

PATIENT X28
Yeah.

DOCTOR X28
You don't have to sleeves then?

PATIENT X28
Sometimes I do.

DOCTOR X28
But you're not a smoker if I remember.

PATIENT X28
No, right, about 35 years ago.

DOCTOR X28
I'm just keeping track of some of this stuff I uh.  @@@.

PATIENT X28
I keep myself busy, I keep myself occupied.

DOCTOR X28
You've had a ton of lab work recently so.

PATIENT X28
Yeah.

DOCTOR X28
All in all you're looking a whole lot better than I expected.  After reading some of these notes, I was a little afraid you know.

PATIENT X28
Uh my kids uh were told that it was gonna be uh, not drive for about six months, I'm gonna have to use the walker.

DOCTOR X28
You're walking fine.  Any neurologic deficits at all?

PATIENT X28
No, no, not at all.  That's why I don't think I need the.

DOCTOR X28
Gotcha.

PATIENT X28
The nurse that comes in, takes my pressure every other week.  

DOCTOR X28
It's been a while, it sounds like last year.  When did you start taking the thiazide, back in August, the hydrochlorothiazide?

PATIENT X28
Maybe.

DOCTOR X28
In September.

PATIENT X28
You mean for the.

DOCTOR X28
Blood pressure.

PATIENT X28
Oh, that's uh that's here.

DOCTOR X28
Right but that was in September.

PATIENT X28
In late September.

DOCTOR X28
Yeah it dropped your sodium a little bit.

PATIENT X28
My potassium was off, the sodium was off.

DOCTOR X28
Yeah.

PATIENT X28
Blood pressure was.

DOCTOR X28
Let's not restart it unless we absolutely have to now.

PATIENT X28
Okay.

DOCTOR X28
@@@.

PATIENT X28
Alright.

DOCTOR X28
You know we should do another cholesterol, I mean you might be due.  So you've been out of the simvastatin for a long time?

PATIENT X28
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X28
Have you been on the same dose?

PATIENT X28
Yes, yes sir.

DOCTOR X28
@@@.

PATIENT X28
I would say six months, not long.

DOCTOR X28
Have they ever increased it?

PATIENT X28
No.

DOCTOR X28
No.  I'm gonna put you on 40 today; just take the full 40 one today.

PATIENT X28
Okay.  The simvastatin?

DOCTOR X28
Yeah instead of half a tab, just take the one tab.

PATIENT X28
Take the one tab.

DOCTOR X28
Yeah, alright.  It probably needs to change, really not change much.

PATIENT X28
Without even checking my blood?

DOCTOR X28
Well they've looked at it back in August.

PATIENT X28
Oh I see, okay.  So you see in the past.

DOCTOR X28
It's a little higher than I probably want it.

PATIENT X28
But everything was off at that time, everything.

DOCTOR X28
Yeah but do you know the cholesterol, it's usually not gonna affect the cholesterol; however, having high cholesterol puts you at risk for strokes.

PATIENT X28
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X28
It's a different type of stroke.  If you bothered to not do it, you can hold off and then recheck eventually, I'm okay with that.

PATIENT X28
Well it's up to you.

DOCTOR X28
No, we work together here, we're a team.

PATIENT X28
I can have another blood test done, either here or outside and uh we'll uh.

DOCTOR X28
Cause you know what, although we don't treat total, we generally treat the number called the LDL.

PATIENT X28
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X28
You're total is, I'd like it under 200 and it's 205.  The LDL you know @@@ and you do have hypertension and you've had a history of stroke I would feel like it @@@ under 100.

PATIENT X28
Alright.

DOCTOR X28
Okay?

PATIENT X28
You the man, you're the doctor.

DOCTOR X28
Okay, so we will go, let's go up to 40.

PATIENT X28
Take the whole thing?

DOCTOR X28
Yes.

PATIENT X28
Okay.

DOCTOR X28
I think, it's not, you're not gonna feel any different.  It's not, if you're feeling, if we checked it and its a little lower, then I think we can just track that down.

PATIENT X28
Okay.

DOCTOR X28
But having a little bit too low of cholesterol @@@ is not a bad thing.

PATIENT X28
Okay.

DOCTOR X28
Okay?  

PATIENT X28
So, yeah I do have another bottle, full bottle at home.

DOCTOR X28
Okay, I'll change it, they might send you more but you can always tell them not to.

PATIENT X28
Well you know by taking in half, you know it lasts quite a long time.

DOCTOR X28
So we'll put that in for you today.  You never made it to Greece then.

PATIENT X28
No (laughter).

DOCTOR X28
I'm really sorry about that.  That's a shame.

PATIENT X28
Alright, there's no way.

DOCTOR X28
I was reading here in my notes.  I read it before I came in, return in a month after patient returns from Greece.

PATIENT X28
Greece yeah and in a way I'm glad I didn't because if I would, if I would of got on the airplane, I probably wouldn't died.

DOCTOR X28
You might have, I think so, you head your head though, would you have hit your head?

PATIENT X28
What do you mean?

DOCTOR X28
Well you said you hit your hit your head a couple of days before you had the symptoms.

PATIENT X28
No that was about maybe a couple of months.

DOCTOR X28
Oh months ago you hit your head.

PATIENT X28
A couple of months before I came here.

DOCTOR X28
Oh so slow.

PATIENT X28
@@@.  I heard the bump.

DOCTOR X28
@@@ like that.  @@@.

PATIENT X28
Yeah and sometimes at night when I'd be watching TV, I couldn't hold my head someplace normal.  I @@@.

DOCTOR X28
You never told me that at the visit that you were feeling dizzy.

PATIENT X28
Uh.

DOCTOR X28
Did you?

PATIENT X28
I think so.  I wasn't really feeling dizzy.  I was feeling uncomfortable.

DOCTOR X28
Okay.

PATIENT X28
Uncomfortable and I thought it was probably my neck.  I thought it was my neck and I would put heating pads on my neck and I would uh move my head this way and that away and go to bed early.  Like I said until one day I got up and I couldn't put my foot in the slipper.

DOCTOR X28
Wow.

PATIENT X28
Anyway.

DOCTOR X28
Good for you that everything.

PATIENT X28
It worked out okay.

DOCTOR X28
It worked out okay.

PATIENT X28
I uh, I'm thankful the people here, I'm glad I came here because I figured if I would've went outside, by the time those people find out how to get their money or who to contact for my records.

DOCTOR X28
I want keep a set of labs first, do you mind?

PATIENT X28
No.

DOCTOR X28
The hemoglobin was a little low and generally everything is coming back normal.  I'll recheck your cholesterol too.  You have to be fasting but that's okay.

PATIENT X28
That's okay.

DOCTOR X28
Its okay, it's not gonna give me the best information but it'll give me some information.

PATIENT X28
Alright.  So I should take the blood test then.

DOCTOR X28
Yeah we'll get some blood @@@.  Um, alright hop up over here.  Since we're done with the chatting, just the exam alright.

PATIENT X28
Okay, should I take anything off?

DOCTOR X28
Yeah, your jacket.

PATIENT X28

DOCTOR X28
That's fine.  If you don't mind @@@.  Any rash or skin changes or anything like that that you've noticed?  Okay.  Alright, shoes.  Give me a deep breath.  Okay.  Good.  Deep breath and hold it, good.  Another deep breath and hold it.  Say ah.

PATIENT X28
Ah.

DOCTOR X28

PATIENT X28
Yes.

DOCTOR X28

DOCTOR X28
Shame on me.  @@@ anything.

PATIENT X28
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X28
Not the devices problem, it's my problem.  I don't like the automated machines they use out there.

PATIENT X28
Oh.

DOCTOR X28
Cause sometimes it doesn't give you accurate numbers.  A little bit higher.

PATIENT X28
What?  What'd you find?

DOCTOR X28
I got like 143/85.

PATIENT X28
Okay.

DOCTOR X28
So we might have to put you on the low dose of that medicine alright?  Um and then in two weeks what we'll do is we'll bring you back for another blood pressure and uh we will check a lab at that time and make sure your potassium and everything is not out of whack.

PATIENT X28

DOCTOR X28
Okay and for example if that blood pressure medication is doing weird things to your system, we have others okay.

PATIENT X28
It didn't do anything wrong.

DOCTOR X28
Okay.  Well no sometimes it can make the potassium go down, it can slow @@@.

PATIENT X28
Oh, oh I see.

PATIENT X28
Oh.

DOCTOR X28
To make sure, cause sometimes this medication can cause your sodium to drop.

PATIENT X28
Okay.

DOCTOR X28
And it can cause your potassium to drop.  There are side effects that we keep an eye on, especially given the recent head you know issues, I want to make sure that everything a) is back to normal now and b) it stays normal after we check it.

Okay.

DOCTOR X28

That was closer to what I @@@ when I first got to call you, I was going to say PATIENT

PATIENT X28
PATIENT.

DOCTOR X28
What does that mean?

PATIENT X28
It means when you're facing the sun.

DOCTOR X28
Okay.

PATIENT X28
You're PATIENT, in Greek you know the sun is called idios.

DOCTOR X28
Idios.

PATIENT X28
PATIENT, so if you are facing the sun, you are PATIENT, like sunny side.

DOCTOR X28
Sunny side up.

PATIENT X28
Okay, so that's what, but I think my uh you know people before me, were probably cold and they were waiting for the sun to come up so they warm themselves up so they were facing the sun.  But anyway.

DOCTOR X28
That's very interesting.  I never heard @@@.

PATIENT X28
But uh that's what it is, so I left it.  A lot of people asked me to change it but I wasn't going to change it.

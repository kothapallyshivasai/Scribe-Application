DOCTOR X732 
PATIENT.  How are you?

PATIENT X732
Okay.

DOCTOR X732
We're gonna go all the way back to the right.

PATIENT X732
To the left or the right?

DOCTOR X732
To the right, all the way back to the right.

PATIENT X732
Okay.  @@@ turn right.

DOCTOR X732
Take your time, take your time.

PATIENT X732
To the right and to the left.

DOCTOR X732
So you guys have had a lot of things to do since the last time I saw you.

PATIENT X732
Ah yes.

DOCTOR X732
Yes and it looks like you've done a lot of them.

PATIENT X732
I've done everything.

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@ he did five in the last month.

PATIENT X732
Except the MRI that you cancelled.

DOCTOR X732
Huh?

PATIENT X732
The MRI that you cancelled.

DOCTOR X732
When did you do the CT?

PATIENT X732
I did the CT already.

DOCTOR X732
I think they can't send you for an MRI because your, you have the what do you call the hardware in your neck right.

PATIENT X732
Right.

SECOND PERSON X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
I don't think you can go because of that.  Or do you have a pacemaker PATIENT?

PATIENT X732
No I don't.

DOCTOR X732
You don't hmm.  For some reason we had to cancel that MRI because yeah it was contraindicated for a reason that I can't quite recall but.

PATIENT X732
No.

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@.

DOCTOR X732
Uh we did.  I think we've come upon something now.

SECOND PERSON X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
When we visited the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor because of the problems with the stride and the walking, do you guys remember what he told you?

PATIENT X732
Right.

DOCTOR X732
What did he tell you was going on?

PATIENT X732
He scheduled me for something else.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
For my eyes as a matter of fact.

DOCTOR X732
He did.

PATIENT X732
And a swallow test.

DOCTOR X732
Yep.

PATIENT X732
And uh I think that was it.

SECOND PERSON X732
So what'd you find out?

DOCTOR X732
So what he thinks is going on is um you might have a syndrome that's very, very similar to Parkinson's disease.  So now it may not be Parkinson's disease specifically so that presents a whole range of items that are very similar.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
And there were things that he saw when he evaluated you so when you write you write really small.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
On the micrographia and when you move you tend to move very slowly, that's what we call bradykinesia and you know the way that he watched you walk, all of these and then that combined with the falls.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
And the difficulty maintaining your blood pressure when you're moving a whole lot.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
He thinks that's what's going on.  So now it's a matter of what are we gonna do next.

PATIENT X732
Right.

DOCTOR X732
There are medications available for this.  I will say I know you're not excited about medication.

PATIENT X732
I am so sick of taking medications.

SECOND PERSON X732
His legs is paining him now too.  Tell her.

PATIENT X732
Right.  I've been walking too much.

SECOND PERSON X732
He only walks in our place.

PATIENT X732
Today I have.

SECOND PERSON X732
PATIENT, he waited in the car, came here and walked from the parking lot.

PATIENT X732
That take effort.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yeah and his nose is bleeding.

PATIENT X732
Yeah my nose has been bleeding every morning.

DOCTOR X732
Hmm.  Are you taking any medications that thin your blood?

PATIENT X732
I don't think so.

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@ up in his nose.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X732
And it's irritating so he @@@.

DOCTOR X732
Then that's exactly why it's bleeding.  You kind of just need to leave it alone.

PATIENT X732
It just started this morning though.

SECOND PERSON X732
You know with that scab @@@ he probably shouldn't do that you know.

DOCTOR X732
Yeah.  We're just gonna have to keep the inside of your nose very well moisturized.

SECOND PERSON X732
That's why I told him to put some Vaseline up in there but.

DOCTOR X732
You could use Vaseline.

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@ you know.

DOCTOR X732
And you can use a saline spray.

SECOND PERSON X732
You know this is something new.  He fell twice yesterday.

PATIENT X732
Did I?

SECOND PERSON X732
Yes you did.  When we came out of church.

PATIENT X732
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X732
Are you using, I don't see that you're using your cane today.

PATIENT X732
I forgot it this morning.

SECOND PERSON X732
He forgot it, he has been, he has been.

DOCTOR X732
Yeah.  I don't think that's gonna be optional anymore PATIENT.

PATIENT X732
I understand but I just forgot it cause I was rushing to get here because we woke up late.

DOCTOR X732
Absolutely.

SECOND PERSON X732
It was not a good night @@@.

PATIENT X732
I woke you up at 10 to 8 didn't I?

SECOND PERSON X732
No.

PATIENT X732
Okay.

DOCTOR X732
So I think.

PATIENT X732
Now what'd they see in the x-rays?

DOCTOR X732
Um I don't think anything has changed too much on the imaging.  Um in terms of your neck.

PATIENT X732
Right.

DOCTOR X732
Are you still having the neck pain?

PATIENT X732
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X732
Wasn't that you who called and said that ya'll seen that one @@@.

DOCTOR X732
So uh a little bit of a change but nothing major so I don't think.

SECOND PERSON X732
But it still bothers him.

PATIENT X732
It feel like its damn heavy behind my ear now.

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
Is it pain?

PATIENT X732
That where it feel like the plate is.

DOCTOR X732
The plate is?  So we definitely do not see that at all because that would have been an abnormality.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
And we would've have uh called you in and um so they didn't find any evidence of a fracture or subluxation which means like they didn't find any where the two parts of the vertebrae sort of aren't aligned anymore.  Um.

SECOND PERSON X732
But when he be getting up, like if he get up out the chair like this.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
I fall back.

SECOND PERSON X732
And falls back I told him he be getting up himself but sometimes he really don't get up that fast.

DOCTOR X732
That is due to what we think is the Parkinson's disease.

SECOND PERSON X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
All of that is tied together so the falls, the problems with the gait, you know we're gonna say all of that and the blood pressure issues, all of that is tied together.

SECOND PERSON X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
So I think we're gonna have to go seeing a neurologist cause they're the ones who really manage this okay and they'll be able to start you on some medications.  So I already put in for the consult but it doesn't look like they've responded to it so I'll put in for it again and I'll call them today.

PATIENT X732
Okay.

DOCTOR X732
So they can get in touch with you and you can get in to see them.

SECOND PERSON X732
And you call the number to go get the driver's test?

DOCTOR X732
Yep.

PATIENT X732
xxx xxx VA.

DOCTOR X732
Yep.

SECOND PERSON X732
I told him, you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X732
It's not that I don't want you to drive.

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@.

DOCTOR X732
It's not safe.

SECOND PERSON X732
I know it's not cause I've been riding with him.

PATIENT X732
(Laughs)

DOCTOR X732
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X732
I know.

DOCTOR X732
So we've got to look at.

SECOND PERSON X732
I'm going to insist that he's not going to drive.

DOCTOR X732
Good, good, good. Um so we'll do the safe things @@@.  

PATIENT X732
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@.

PATIENT X732
I @@@ garbage.

DOCTOR X732
And then did you get that reacher?

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
Okay and have you been using that at home?

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
I think I used it once.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X732
He been reaching to get that, I told him to put it closer.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X732
So he been using it.  He does use his cane @@@ the day.

DOCTOR X732
You've been using it.
PATIENT X732
Oh we're @@@.

DOCTOR X732
Oh okay, that's okay.  So @@@ you sign this stuff.  Um when you're having those kind of nosebleeds you have to be very gentle with your nose.  You can't keep blowing it.  All you want to do, I know it's irritating, is hold out, @@@.  Hold the tissue up to your nose and try not to blow, just hold it.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
And then right here on the bridge of your nose hold down.

SECOND PERSON X732
Now see that has started happening like this.

PATIENT X732
This morning.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yeah this just started happening, it hasn't been like that.

DOCTOR X732
Just hold it.

SECOND PERSON X732
But @@@ I saw @@@ it get all @@@ underneath his nose @@@ but then he @@@ blow it @@@ you know not blood, mucous you know come out.

PATIENT X732
Hmm.

DOCTOR X732
Don't blow okay.  You just want to hold pressure here to prevent it from bleeding and help it clot.  I know it's irritating in here and you want to blow it out but you're not gonna be able to because there's a scab in it.

PATIENT X732
I have to breathe.

SECOND PERSON X732
Oh he definitely had a scab.

DOCTOR X732
You can breathe through your mouth.

PATIENT X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
Breathe through your mouth okay.

PATIENT X732
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON X732
But he always be picking at it you know.

DOCTOR X732
Yeah don't pick it.

SECOND PERSON X732
Don't do that, cause I looked up there.

DOCTOR X732
You're not giving it a chance to heal.

SECOND PERSON X732
I was just seeing that he was blowing and I told him not to pick it, just leave it.  I was gonna put some Vaseline in it.

DOCTOR X732
Vaseline and we'll get you some saline spray today.

SECOND PERSON X732
And I bring him here doctor.

PATIENT X732
Wow.  Yes ma'am.

SECOND PERSON X732
Listen to her.

PATIENT X732
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.  Alright.  So that's kind of where we are with that so I think the big key, you know, how much the medications are gonna be able to help is really unclear.  It just depends on how you respond to them.  So I think the big key is it's gonna be some changing lifestyle stuff so using your cane, using the reacher.  Try not to get into situations where you're bending over a lot or coming back up.

SECOND PERSON X732
Right.

DOCTOR X732
No sudden motions.  You want to do everything gingerly.

SECOND PERSON X732
Why?

DOCTOR X732
Because the issue is your body is having a hard time regulating.

PATIENT X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
Your blood pressure so when I move up and down like this my body's able to maintain my blood pressure so I don't feel woozy when I come back up and this way I don't fall backwards.  Well one of the things that you find with this disease is that your body has a hard time doing that it's what we call postural hypotension.  So depending on what, you know, position you're in and if you're moving from one position to another it's having a hard time maintaining um blood pressure all over your body and so that's when you can easily fall.

PATIENT X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
Okay right, cause there was one fall when you were like this, you came back up and then.

SECOND PERSON X732
He go back.

DOCTOR X732
And then you'd go this way right?

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@ do that.

DOCTOR X732
So you know.

SECOND PERSON X732
No more reaching for the bag.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
And you leaning this way, you know falling over.

DOCTOR X732
Absolutely.

SECOND PERSON X732
But then he got up and went back then he fell back.

DOCTOR X732
Backwards yeah.

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.  Parkinson's huh?

DOCTOR X732
Yeah.  Similar to it yeah.  Like we can't confirm that yet until you go to the neurologist but that's what this other doctor is thinking that it's a Parkinson's like type syndrome.  I will give you some information about that before you leave today.

PATIENT X732
Okay.

DOCTOR X732
Um so I know those are the first things on your mind.

SECOND PERSON X732
We can deal with that.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@.

DOCTOR X732
Very.

SECOND PERSON X732
Give it all.

DOCTOR X732
That's all I've got for you now.

SECOND PERSON X732
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X732
We will know more once we see the brain doctor.  He's the guy who's gonna be able to really um give us the @@@ what's going on.

SECOND PERSON X732
And that's why he be having the shakes like that?

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.  All of it is tied together.

SECOND PERSON X732
Cause sometimes he can just shake, shake, shake.

PATIENT X732
Yeah one night I was shaking so bad it was terrible.

DOCTOR X732
Do you guys remember xxx J. Fox?

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
That's what he's got Parkinson's?

DOCTOR X732
He has Parkinson's.

SECOND PERSON X732
Right and Cassius Clay.

PATIENT X732
Cassius Clay don't have Parkinson's does he?

SECOND PERSON X732
Yes he do uh what's his name?

PATIENT X732
Mohammed Ali.

DOCTOR X732
Mohammad Ali.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yeah I called him Cassius Clay but yeah he has it.

PATIENT X732
Hmm.  That a rich folks disease huh?

SECOND PERSON X732
@@@.

DOCTOR X732
So um I want you to know though I'm giving you information for Parkinson's disease but that's not exactly what you might have.

SECOND PERSON X732
That's not what he has.

DOCTOR X732
Because you know with anything you know whether its lung disease or heart disease there's always you know a couple of different options.  Everything's just a little bit different than the other one but I'm just giving you the basics.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yes, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
And then as we continue to sort of work with the neurologist we'll have a much better idea okay.  So I will print this uh, I'll do that before we leave today.  Let's talk about a couple other things.

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
Um alright.  Any chest pain recently?

PATIENT X732
No.

DOCTOR X732
Okay good.  And how about pain in your legs?

PATIENT X732

DOCTOR X732

SECOND PERSON X732
You didn't walk far away just from downstairs and the car.

DOCTOR X732
Where in your legs are you having it?

PATIENT X732
In the mid-calf.

DOCTOR X732
In the mid-calf, just one?  Right up there?

PATIENT X732
Right, right up here, just one leg.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X732
And then cause he's not used to walking up two flights on the second floor now, he used to be on the third floor, which we gonna be back there in about a month.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X732
You know but we be walking up two flights of stairs.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X732
So that gets to me sometimes.

DOCTOR X732
Absolutely.  Where do you find, do you find that your legs hurt by the time you're on the second flight of stairs or not really?

PATIENT X732
No they don't usually hurt when I'm going up stairs.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

PATIENT X732

SECOND PERSON X732
He still be, he still be clumsy cause I have to be behind him.

PATIENT X732

DOCTOR X732
Alright.  Your blood pressure looks good today so we'll go ahead and not change anything in terms of your blood pressure medications.

PATIENT X732
Okay.

DOCTOR X732
Um let's see.

PATIENT X732
Now then the metoprolol.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
I stopped taking it during the day.

DOCTOR X732
You have?

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
How come?

PATIENT X732
Cause it was making me sleepy and tired all the time.

DOCTOR X732
Why did you feel like it was the metoprolol versus all the other things?

PATIENT X732
My sister told me that's what it was.

DOCTOR X732
Oh.

SECOND PERSON X732
Who you told you that?

PATIENT X732
NAME.

SECOND PERSON X732
How does only one person know your medicine?

PATIENT X732
I don't take that one in the morning but I do take it at night.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

PATIENT X732
That was the I was taking twice a day.

SECOND PERSON X732
But you still be tired anyway so.

PATIENT X732
But with this pill I be exhausted.

SECOND PERSON X732
But baby you don't do nothing.

PATIENT X732
I know.

SECOND PERSON X732
So take it!

PATIENT X732
No I don't want to take it.

DOCTOR X732
Um.

SECOND PERSON X732
He just want to get off those pills.

PATIENT X732
I do.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yeah I know but you getting ready to take more now.

PATIENT X732
Well shit.

SECOND PERSON X732
More pills now okay.

DOCTOR X732
Well I don't know if it's for your blood pressure, let me just make sure.

PATIENT X732
Here's the metoprolol here.

DOCTOR X732
It could also be used for your heart rate so I just need to check one thing, going back in time.  Okay so we're fine.  If you really feel that way and looking at your heart rate, if you haven't taken it this morning then that's fine.  I'm okay with you holding off on the metoprolol.

PATIENT X732
I been taking it for the month.

DOCTOR X732
Okay you haven't taken it okay.

PATIENT X732
At least for the entire month.

DOCTOR X732
Alright so we'll say um, I'm gonna have to figure out how to reduce your metoprolol but maybe we can cut back on the dose okay.  Because it is a medication you're supposed to be taking twice a day.  It doesn't work.

SECOND PERSON X732
But he don't take it.

DOCTOR X732
But you know what we could do.

SECOND PERSON X732
Oh yeah, I know you told me that but I didn't know you had stopped taking it.

DOCTOR X732
Yeah I'll have to.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
So we'll have to figure that part out.

SECOND PERSON X732
You better believe the MD.

PATIENT X732
She's telling me what it was she said I used it the other way.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yeah but still people die insisting.

PATIENT X732
I know.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.  I don't know that the metoprolol is really contributing to your feelings of fatigue but um we'll see what we can do to try to.

SECOND PERSON X732
He still hasn't changed.  He still be in the bed all the time and he @@@ to be tired but.

PATIENT X732
Yeah but I don't be sleeping.

SECOND PERSON X732
You don't be sleeping.

PATIENT X732
No.

SECOND PERSON X732
You don't be sleeping at night, so like you said.

PATIENT X732
I know.

SECOND PERSON X732
So what are you saying?  You want to be @@@.

PATIENT X732
I don't know.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
Let's just see for a second here.  Your last CBC, maybe you're anemic.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
You're a little bit anemic at 12.7 but that's barely, I mean that's just a little bit lower than what we would think um.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
Um your MCV looks fine.  Let me look at the cholesterol.

SECOND PERSON X732
I wish my doctor would do that @@@, she's good.

DOCTOR X732
And your iron levels were fine, the last time I checked because I did check um because you were just a little bit anemic we wanted to make sure that you were okay, so I don't think it's that in terms of what's making you fatigued.  Um it could be Parkinson's.  Are you eating alright?

PATIENT X732
Hell yes.

DOCTOR X732
Are you having any problems sleeping at night?  Does he snore at night?

SECOND PERSON X732
He do have a problem with sleeping but he do sleep light @@@.  He be like talking and @@@.

DOCTOR X732
So he doesn't sleep very restful.

SECOND PERSON X732
I'll be hopping out of bed you know what you want and he'll say no, he'll be doing something like the other night, uh you were doing something with a dog or something, was it a dog or something and I said what are you doing and he said oh I'm just.  No I know what it was.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
He got up and just started washing @@@ cigarette, so he was going like this.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
Do you remember that?

PATIENT X732
Uh uh.

SECOND PERSON X732
He was doing like this and I said what'd be doing?  And he said I'm gonna light this cigarette.  I said what cigarette and then he woke up. I thought he was woke.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
And he said I'm trying to wake and I said wake up and he said oh I was asleep and then in the morning I asked him and he don't even remember.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
Doing it oh yeah sometimes he'll do something and I'll ask him when I'm standing there, oh I was, he be like he won't but then the next thing I know he's snoring so he still be talking in his sleep.

DOCTOR X732
So is he snoring every night when he's sleeping?

SECOND PERSON X732
No, no.

PATIENT X732
No.

SECOND PERSON X732
You know he may be but he don't take his dentures out his mouth.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X732
So his tongue be like this so I think he would snore.

DOCTOR X732
Do you think you're snoring?  Cause it could be that you're not sleeping well at night and that's why um you feel a lot of daytime sleepiness.  So there's a test.

SECOND PERSON X732
But he don't sleep that much so he can't sleep.

PATIENT X732
I can't sleep during the daytime.

SECOND PERSON X732
He be taking naps but he don't know he be taking naps.  He don't go @@@.

DOCTOR X732
So that kind of sounds like somebody who's not sleeping very well at night um.

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
Um so I think what we can do is um we can do a test called a sleep study when you come here for a night and they monitor how you sleep.

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
And if they find that you have um difficulty or you're snoring a lot, they can give you a machine that allows you to sleep better at night called a CPAP machine.

SECOND PERSON X732
But he don't snore like this.

PATIENT X732
No.

DOCTOR X732
You don't think so; you don't think this is a problem?

SECOND PERSON X732
No he was telling me he was just saying he'll tell me that he didn't go to sleep until about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.

DOCTOR X732
So you're not sleeping.

SECOND PERSON X732
But.

PATIENT X732
Right.

SECOND PERSON X732
He do be asleep.  He don't know that he's asleep so he don't be getting cause he be talking but he be asleep.

SECOND PERSON X732

PATIENT X732

SECOND PERSON X732
Yes, okay.

PATIENT X732
That's mostly when I'm laying down.

SECOND PERSON X732
Yeah well regardless you do have it.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
Cause I told you you had carpal tunnel.

PATIENT X732
Right.

SECOND PERSON X732
And I gave you my brace that I needed to put on my wrist.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X732
And you told me it wasn't fun.

PATIENT X732
Now my feet getting cold.

DOCTOR X732
Okay I'm sorry.  I may put you on a daily aspirin.  I'm surprised it hasn't been ordered.

PATIENT X732
I take one.

DOCTOR X732
You do?

PATIENT X732
Yeah.

DOCTOR X732
But you're buying them at the store?

PATIENT X732
Right.

DOCTOR X732
Oh okay.  So that's why I don't see them anywhere else.  I'm like I can't believe I don't have you on a daily aspirin.

PATIENT X732
I was on it before I used to get it from here.

DOCTOR X732
Okay.

PATIENT X732
Then I found out it was cheaper.

DOCTOR X732
Oh okay.  Good.

PATIENT X732
To get it at the store.

DOCTOR X732
Alright I'm glad you're doing that.  Oh I do, I see I have it on my list; it's just not on this list though.

PATIENT X732
Okay.

DOCTOR X732
For a minute there I was worried.  You're right; they are a little cool to the touch.  I just want to check this here.  Alright.  Well I would say that we have you on everything that we need to have you on in terms of your um peripheral vascular disease, you're on an aspirin.  You're taking your simvastatin right now.  I would say that if it's not getting worse um he can stick with it.  The key to this disease is basically what's happening is that we're having a build-up of cholesterol throughout your body and it's making it hard for the blood to flow.

PATIENT X732
Oh.

DOCTOR X732
So the key to this is that to keep like exercising.  Like if you, say if you're walking one block and you're developing that pain in the back of your leg.

PATIENT X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
Every day you want to walk a little bit further so today's a block, tomorrow you're gonna walk a block.

PATIENT X732
Like a half.

DOCTOR X732
Yeah and slowly but surely that will improve so that's the only real thing that we can do um is to try to exercise because you know as things progress then you start getting into like getting stents in your legs and things like that but anything that we can do to try to improve it on our own, is much better.

SECOND PERSON X732
So he always be tired.  We gonna start walking.

PATIENT X732
Yeah I feel very weak too when I fall.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
And try to get up.

DOCTOR X732
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X732
I have no strength.

DOCTOR X732
I think this all is related to the blood pressure issues and so I think we're definitely gonna need some guidance as well from the neurologist about how to deal with your blood pressure issues cause I don't want to be you know doing things that make it worse.

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
So um we'll definitely get you in to see the neurologist as soon as we can okay.  And I think some of your medications are going to change depending on what they say alright.

SECOND PERSON X732
Okay.

DOCTOR X732
Give me one second, I'm gonna be right back.

PATIENT X732
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  50:24  DOCTOR IN:  67:39)

DOCTOR X732

SECOND PERSON X732
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X732
So I'm sorry to keep you guys waiting here.  We had so much to discuss cause there's so much going on in here.  So I think, yeah man it's not staying up.  Um I think the big thing that um we sort of came up with is the two doctors that you're seeing are kind of the two best doctors um.

PATIENT X732

DOCTOR X732
I don't know they could be but they're the two best doctors that you need to be seeing which one is the brain doctor.

PATIENT X730
They wanted me to come in.

DOCTOR X730
Sure, sure.  I kind of read a little about it.  So, um, were you having any urinary symptoms at all?  Any um pain when you go to the bathroom, when you urinate?  

PATIENT X730
No.

DOCTOR X730
Any increase in urination at all?

You have refills on all of this stuff.  All you have to do is call the pharmacy.

PATIENT X730
@@@.

DOCTOR X730
Um, any fevers or chills at home at all?

PATIENT X730
Nope.

DOCTOR X730
Okay.  Now, so we were discussing, so your urine is, it grew a bacteria, is the reason that @@@ but your actual, your urinalysis, your urine was good itself.

PATIENT X730
Okay.

DOCTOR X730
Um we look at, you know we send it for culture which takes a few days and we also look at the results @@@.

PATIENT X730
So everything is good then?

DOCTOR X730
So, yea, I think um, this bacteria doesn’t really mean you have a urinary tract infection because typically if somebody doesn’t have any symptoms of urinary tract infection like pain when they urinate and things like that, that @@@ that’s just, you know bacteria that kind of either in the urine tract so then it can contaminate @@@.  It doesn’t necessarily mean that we have to treat with antibiotics.

PATIENT X196
I have hepatitis C yeah.

DOCTOR X196
Hepatitis C.

PATIENT X196
Yeah, yeah, could that be the problem?

DOCTOR X196
No, no, no.  Um I'm just trying to see if your immune system's intact.  Um you don't have any immune, you don't take steroids or anything?

PATIENT X196
Uh uh, nope.

DOCTOR X196
I think we can give you the same antibiotic for you.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
I think we are going to give you an antibiotic and I think it'll help clear it up.  You can, I don't know if we have uh, so basically what we found when you were admitted to the hospital, we do like this @@@.  Do you ever remember getting the @@@?

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
You have a bug that grows in there called methicillin-resistant Staph aureus.  You've heard about Staph infection?

PATIENT X196
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X196
Uh it's the type of bacteria that grows on all our skin.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
Okay and you can get a folliculitis, which means the follicle, the hair follicle is infected.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
And usually your body deals with it, you know like a zit.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
You know uh when you get a zit or a pimple, that's an infected little, you know I've got one forming here.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
Or here's an old one.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
You got an old one here.

PATIENT X196
Yeah.

DOCTOR X196
And you can probably see @@@.

PATIENT X196
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X196
Yeah right here and right here.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR X196
Those are little bitty like inflammations and your body usually deals with it.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
Sometimes though we can get an ingrown hair.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
Follicle that can get stuck, trapped in there like that pus.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
And it's a little stronger infection okay.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
And you have a bug in your body, not everyone has it, some people have it and if it's in your nose we say it's colonized.  You know, it's just these bacteria grow they don't cause infection for you most of the time.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
You may have a little bit of an infection with skin flow which could be this resistant bug called MRSA.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
In which case we can give you an antibiotic which will help clear it.  If you want to get rid of the bug entirely you can do this Decolonization Clinic, I don't think we have it here at the VA though.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
You'd have to go to a private hospital to get that done.

PATIENT X196
What was that called?

DOCTOR X196
It's like a Decolonization Clinic.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh okay.

DOCTOR X196
They have one at xxx but I don't know, I don't know what the options are for veterans.

PATIENT X196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X196
Um I'll go and ask what my attending what they do but I think if we give you an antibiotic for that we can clear that up okay.

PATIENT X196
Okay.  Hey doc another things man, could write me a prescription now for some smoke patches?

DOCTOR X196

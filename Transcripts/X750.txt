DOCTOR X750

Losartan.

PATIENT X750
Losartan right and then I was on fish oil pills.

DOCTOR X750

PATIENT X750
And then the other thing that I was on uh like.

DOCTOR X750
Chlorthalidone? 

PATIENT X750
Yeah chlorthalidone but I really didn't like that one.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.

PATIENT X750
The one previous to that, I'd been on.

DOCTOR X750
Hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X750
Yeah the hydrochlorothiazide was better.

DOCTOR X750
When was the last time you took any of these?

PATIENT X750
Uh like a month ago is when I ran out.

DOCTOR X750
Okay and you take fish oil how many times?

PATIENT X750
Uh I would, I was taking those twice a day.  Uh like uh two pills.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.  And were you taking amlodipine?

PATIENT X750
Uh no.

SECOND PERSON X750
That was a long time ago.

PATIENT X750
That was the one prior; I think that was in um what do they call it.  So there'd be @@@ but there was another one before that that I took that didn't seem to work very well not AR the other one.

DOCTOR X750

PATIENT X750
ACE inhibitor yeah it was an ACE inhibitor that was it.  It made me cough a little bit.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.

PATIENT X750
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X750
And then they put you on another thing at that time.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah I know that's what it was called.

PATIENT X750
Oh that's right, I remember now.  There was also the amlodipine @@@ no it was a different one.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.  And you haven't been taking that right?

PATIENT X750
No.  I ran out of everything and I didn't have another appointment for a while.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.  Alright.  Okay and I saw that your blood pressure was high.

PATIENT X750
Yeah I've never had it that high before, that's crazy.

DOCTOR X750
Do you check it at home?

PATIENT X750
Uh I should but I haven't be no.

DOCTOR X750
Do have a monitor?

PATIENT X750

DOCTOR X750
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X750
Yeah.

DOCTOR X750
And we're due for labs, the yearly labs.  But you faint every time huh?

PATIENT X750
Pretty much.  It's not every time but it's.

DOCTOR X750
And there's just so many @@@ of passing out.  Is it because you don't eat or?

PATIENT X750
No, they only draw the blood and then about two minutes later then I pass out.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.

PATIENT X750
Yeah.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah.

PATIENT X750
All of a sudden.

SECOND PERSON X750
This happened @@@.

PATIENT X750
So the last time I was in.

SECOND PERSON X750
The last time it was in the hospital.

PATIENT X750
Yeah the last time it was terrible.

SECOND PERSON X750
That's why @@@ taken it.

PATIENT X750
Because then I pass out for like five minutes and stuff like that.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.

PATIENT X750
And that's why they rolled me down to the ER because I didn't wake up right away.

SECOND PERSON X750
Maybe they can elevate his feet.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah maybe.

PATIENT X750
Whatever.  That's just why I don't like it very much.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.  Okay.  Let me listen to your heart and lungs.  What do you when you teach a class?

PATIENT X750
Uh graphite and diamonds.

DOCTOR X750
Oh wow.  Deep breathe, good, again, alright.  So it's geology that you're into?

PATIENT X750
Uh no actually I'm a chemist.

DOCTOR X750
Chemist okay.

PATIENT X750
So yeah.

DOCTOR X750
And do you smoke?

PATIENT X750
No.

DOCTOR X750
Drink or anything like that?

PATIENT X750
I don't smoke.  The only time I drink is like maybe once a month @@@.

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X750
So.  Very occasionally.

DOCTOR X750
No illicit drug use?

PATIENT X750
Nope.

SECOND PERSON X750
He @@@.

PATIENT X750
Well this was just a case study.  What do you get after you write a thesis?

DOCTOR X750
Any kids at home?

PATIENT X750
None.

SECOND PERSON X750
@@@ before your thesis @@@.

PATIENT X750
Oh they have, they have @@@ yeah.

SECOND PERSON X750
They have the formula.  They have a formula.

PATIENT X750
Yeah this at the Ph.D. Program.

DOCTOR X750
What do you not like about the chlorthalidone?  

PATIENT X750
Uh it causes erectile dysfunction so.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.

PATIENT X750
It was because of that yeah, absolutely.  Uh the other thing is it will make me slightly dizzy on occasion and uh let's see what else.  I think it also just made me feel generally bad.  I don't to say like depressive but not feel, like low energy I guess.

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X750
Is the way I'd describe it.

SECOND PERSON X750
@@@.

DOCTOR X750
I'll talk to DOCTOR; he's one of the attending physicians here.  But I'm thinking we'll probably restart you on some of your blood pressure medicines and have you followup with the nurse for a blood pressure check okay.  Um.

PATIENT X750
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X750
So we could always put you on the hydrochlorothiazide if you like that better than the chlorthalidone.

PATIENT X750
Yeah definitely that was better than the chlorthalidone.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X750
Oh yeah and is there any @@@ Nephrology people or do you need that?

PATIENT X750
@@@ unless they have.

DOCTOR X750
Chemistry.

PATIENT X750
Yeah.

DOCTOR X750
Let me see @@@.

PATIENT X750
But I'll try to set up, yeah a urine sample for the nephrectomy.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.

PATIENT X750
I'm supposed to see those guys like next month or something.  Based on what the nephrologist sees.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah.  Okay, I'll be right back.

DOCTOR OUT:  13:25   DOCTOR IN:  25:24

DOCTOR X750
Alright.  @@@.  I'm gonna start you again on the hydrochlorothiazide, not the chlorthalidone.

PATIENT X750
Okay.

DOCTOR X750
Uh and you can get a combo pill, your Losartan is a combo pill, just give you one pill.  And I think okay.  So whenever you get your blood drawn, ask if you can lie down completely.

PATIENT X750
Yeah, so I figure @@@.

DOCTOR X750
But just tell them @@@ ooh every bit.

SECOND PERSON X750
@@@.

DOCTOR X750
Just ask if you can lie down before and then once you're done give yourself a couple minutes and then get up.

PATIENT X750
Yeah I think that's probably the wise idea.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah.

PATIENT X750
So @@@.

SECOND PERSON X750
It really bothers him.

DOCTOR X750
Okay I'll put you on the hydrochlorothiazide take 25 and the Losartan you were taking 100.

PATIENT X750
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X750
So you just take two pills so there's a combo pill that has both your medicines in it and you just take two pills of that in the morning.

SECOND PERSON X750
So you take it, the dose is two pills.

PATIENT X750
The dose is two pills once per day.

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh yeah.  So each pill has 12.5 of hydrochlorothiazide and 50 of the Losartan.

PATIENT X750
I got it, gotcha.

DOCTOR X750
(Someone knocks on the door)  Come in.  Okay thank you.  Okay and then I'm gonna have you check your blood pressure at home and then I can call you in a couple of weeks.

PATIENT X750
Okay.

DOCTOR X750
And just ask you what it is.  That way you don't have to come back in.

PATIENT X750
Okay.

DOCTOR X750
And if it's not controlled we might just start you on amlodipine again.

PATIENT X750
Okay.  I'll start checking.

DOCTOR X750
Alright.  So I put your labs in @@@ and that should be good enough for the renal people.  They'll ask you for some urine.

PATIENT X750
Okay.

DOCTOR X750
I'll put everything they might want in.  Do you have any other questions?  Do you need anything else?

PATIENT X750
Uh just um, I think there were two things.  So the first thing is what's the point of contact if I run out of medicine again that I can get a hold of you?

DOCTOR X750
You can call here, the nurses or and they can usually just have the doctors like usually DOCTOR can refill it from here.

PATIENT X750
Okay alright so just call the main clinic.

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X750
And that'll work it out.

SECOND PERSON X750
And then the thing if he decides something in the combo pill doesn't work like the other one did or something he works with, he's unhappy with.

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.  And I plan to see him back in two months just to like sort that out.

PATIENT X750
Okay that's fine yeah.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.  This will sort it out and as long as you're stable you can just come like a regular doctor's visit once a year.

PATIENT X750
Okay sure.

DOCTOR X750
Okay.  But just to check on your meds and everything.

PATIENT X750
No that makes sense.

DOCTOR X750
Alright.  Any other questions?

PATIENT X750
No it's just uh @@@.

DOCTOR X750
The fish oil.

PATIENT X750
Oh yeah fish oil is probably a good thing to put me on.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah.

PATIENT X750
Is there um uh so I have been having like acne issues.  I was wondering if it was possible to see a dermatologist?

DOCTOR X750
Yeah you should be able to come in and see them.  But your fish oil is a good thing.  You remember if it was 1000?

PATIENT X750
Yeah it was 1000.

DOCTOR X750
Twice a day.

PATIENT X750
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X750
Okay and I can put in a referral for the dermatologist but um let me see if I can give you something.  Have you tried anything before?

PATIENT X750
Oh my God.

SECOND PERSON X750
He has been dealing with this.

PATIENT X750
Years.

DOCTOR X750
Years.

PATIENT X750
Yeah when I was in high school I started out on tetracycline and then that got moved up to minocycline at some point.

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X750
Uh so it's kind of been @@@.

DOCTOR X750
Have you tried like Retin A and all that other stuff?

PATIENT X750
Yeah I did try Retin A once that was kind of nasty.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah.

PATIENT X750
Not good.

DOCTOR X750
Dried you out pretty good.  Have you tried, but can @@@ and see if that works.  Do you think it @@@ some kind of service connection for @@@.

PATIENT X750
I think I'm like at 0% for derm.

DOCTOR X750
You're at 0% for derm?

PATIENT X750
Yeah.

DOCTOR X750
I think that'll work, let me just see.  Have you tried, so you've tried hydrogen peroxide, you've tried?

SECOND PERSON X750
And he's tried a lot of things but @@@ felt that he should see Derm regularly.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X750
@@@.

DOCTOR X750
Yeah and he can be referred to them and so.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X750
I think it's @@@ acne because it's not just regular acne.  It was really bad when you were in Iraq right?

PATIENT X750
That's true, then why it's a 0% service connection?

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.  And you saw DOCTOR so they'll see you, so I'll put it in.  There you go and okay.

SECOND PERSON X750
12.5 @@@.

PATIENT X750
It's 12.5 x2, so that's 25 and then the 50 times two is 100.

SECOND PERSON X750
So which one is which?

PATIENT X750
So it's 12.5 of the hydrochlorothiazide.

DOCTOR X750
Okay yeah I put it in.  Let me put it on here and they can just schedule the appointment.  @@@ they'll call you.  That's okay.

PATIENT X750
Okay well thanks so much, sure appreciate.

DOCTOR X750
No worries.

PATIENT X750
So are you a resident here?

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X750
Oh good luck with everything I hope you survive.

DOCTOR X750
I hope so too.  It's hard to say.

PATIENT X750
Well no I mean I know all the pressure on the MDs and like.

DOCTOR X750
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X750

DOCTOR X750

PATIENT X750

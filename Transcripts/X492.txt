DOCTOR X492
PATIENT?

PATIENT X492
@@@.

DOCTOR X492
I'm DOCTOR, it's nice to meet you.

PATIENT X492
@@@.

DOCTOR X492
How you doing today?

PATIENT X492
Feel good uh but I see that my blood pressure is high.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah it's a little off huh.

PATIENT X492
I don't understand that.

DOCTOR X492
Well, so tell me what your on for blood pressure right now.

PATIENT X492
Say again.

DOCTOR X492
What medicine are you taking for blood pressure right now?

PATIENT X492
Well I was taking this metoprolol.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
And that's cause I was @@@ in my heart.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
Then they bumped it up for another 25, what do you call it?

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh the milligrams so.

PATIENT X492
Okay milligrams the last time but.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
What I don't understand is this blood pressure business; see I don't shake a salt shaker.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
I haven't did that in about 30 years.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.  So.

PATIENT X492
I know everything what you say, all processed food.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
And frozen things.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
Cause but I would say, I saw the dietician.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
And I got a little book so I could understand uh.

DOCTOR X492
Perfect.

PATIENT X492
My boneless, skinless chicken.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
I @@@ that might have had and I do frozen vegetables and stuff so I don't, I kind of monitor my sodium.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
So this @@@ me how it's up like that.

DOCTOR X492
Well here's the thing, in some people there is, in most people it's a genetic one okay in that your parents have had it.  They might not have known that they had it or not but your family has it, their family has it so and as you age it just becomes a little bit harder to control.  Now the dose that you're on of the metoprolol.

PATIENT X492
Yeah.

DOCTOR X492
Is very little.  It's actually very, very, we can go up to 200 you know.

PATIENT X492
Well how much is it now?

DOCTOR X492
You're only at 50.

PATIENT X492
Well that's alright with me, it's 50.

DOCTOR X492
I'm saying that there's a lot of room to go up and in a lot of people they have to use multiple medicines.  You're only on one so.

PATIENT X492
Well what is it; I don't understand why I got to use the medicine.  This is what's losing me.

DOCTOR X492
It's nothing to do with you.  People can exercise as much as they want, they can eat you know the best food that they can possibly get and have no fat, no salt, nothing.

PATIENT X492
Does it come with age?

DOCTOR X492
It can come with age and it can come with your family inheritance with your genetics okay.

PATIENT X492
Well okay if you look at here you can see how at mostly one time it was taken for my heart.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
You know my @@@ lisinopril.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
but it was not agreeing with the allergies.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
So then you could see what my blood pressure was then can't you?

DOCTOR X492
You can but @@@.

PATIENT X492
And that's @@@.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah you can but the thing is that was also years ago right?

PATIENT X492
Yeah, yeah, yeah, years ago.

DOCTOR X492
And as you age it gets worse.

PATIENT X492
Oh yeah?

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
Them birthdays make some oh okay.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.  As you age it gets worse.  It's nothing you're doing wrong.

PATIENT X492
But it's kind of scary, I tell you I mean like okay now what is this today, its 145 or something over 81.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
Is that high blood pressure or is that the high end of normal?  I need the exact language.

DOCTOR X492
So it's high blood pressure okay cause for you, anybody who has blood pressure, your goal should be less than 130/80 okay.  So you're about 15 over which is not horrible but obviously could be better.

PATIENT X492
Okay now, now I ate breakfast and took my medicine at 1 o'clock so does that have anything to do with it?

DOCTOR X492
No cause the only thing you're on is extended, I know you're fishing for it aren't you?  We're like a what if kind of day.

PATIENT X492
I'm trying to.

DOCTOR X492
I know.

PATIENT X492
I'd like to know.

DOCTOR X492
You know I appreciate that you're, you know you're just trying to help yourself.  It's okay.  Don't worry about it.  Um it's just.

PATIENT X492
But my @@@.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
Just one day, gonna see you next time and I'm gonna see him when I can and get all the blood tests @@@.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
Did you see that?

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
Well that day I fainted, now what does that mean?

DOCTOR X492
Well @@@ it will happen.

PATIENT X492
I was cooking right and I take medicine oh shoot I got to the point where you know I couldn't stand up anymore so I told my son I said listen uh you go on and eat I'll get back to it later.

DOCTOR X492
Was it hot where you were cooking or what happened?

PATIENT X492
No it wasn't hot.  You know it's like the lights went out but I could feel it.  I was on my feet and all of a sudden then I went to the bed and I sat up and was talking and then I just keeled over okay, but maybe a second as I was coherent like I.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
Could use some water or something you know, I get me some water.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.

PATIENT X492
And so we got me some water and then so I gets back up it continues.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
And then I know I had to lay back down cause I could see that I hadn't been down there long enough.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
But so anyway then I @@@ so then I came up here.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
And then I saw the Emergency Room doctor and then they gave me uh a what's it called, a machine so I could do my own blood pressure.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
And then I @@@ checked my feet and then sometime they do it over here, well I don't understand that you were told to do it over here.

DOCTOR X492
You can do it on this side.

PATIENT X492
Now all the information I got say you do it on this only.

DOCTOR X492
They want you to do it in one arm and stick to that one arm.

PATIENT X492
Yeah so they say.

DOCTOR X492
But you can take it on the other one, it's.

PATIENT X492
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah it's alright.  Well let's just take a look at some of your old stuff real fast.

PATIENT X492
Well @@@ but it's better than the current shoot, at least not as it looks.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah and @@@.

PATIENT X492
@@@ was doctor what's his name DOCTOR or whatever.

DOCTOR X492
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X492
I think it was the doctor's name, it was borderline then and then for some reason I was able to work with it but then when DOCTOR became my doctor just, it got out of hand.  Sometime I comes here and I haven't had my medicine that day but I had it today.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
But you said next time that matter though huh?

DOCTOR X492
Not honestly that much. Um now my question for you is when you were having that dizziness did you have any pain in your chest at all?

PATIENT X492
Oh really no.  It's just @@@ um I was kind of telling my son, I was explaining it to you uh. 

DOCTOR X492
@@@ next time.

PATIENT X492
Not too high but I got @@@ though.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
And it seemed like the room just, so what it was I hadn't eaten yet that day.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
And it was almost 4 p.m.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah I mean that most likely is what did it.

PATIENT X492
You know.

DOCTOR X492
You know, just not having, cause what happens if you don't eat you don't have any nutrients in your body that can break down whatever you already have in just in the muscles.

PATIENT X492
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X492
And the liver and people, at your age, are not as good at accommodating to it.

PATIENT X492
Yeah.

DOCTOR X492
You know.

PATIENT X492
I mean he thought it was an emergency and he said dial 911 and I said no it don't seem that serious.  I know I got to get the medicine and I got to.

DOCTOR X492
Do you feel like your heart was racing at that time?

PATIENT X492
No not at that time.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
Not at that particular time but it has raced one time, just once only but not that time.

DOCTOR X492
When did it race?

PATIENT X492
Oh maybe between um about 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock one night.

DOCTOR X492
How long ago was this?

PATIENT X492
It was over a couple of years ago because I put my @@@ my sister.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
And it was not last year.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.

PATIENT X492
Maybe in 2008 that happened.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.

PATIENT X492
And you know I was playing a computer game and it started and so I just stopped playing the game but I didn't know what might of made that.  It only happened one time though.

DOCTOR X492
Okay, okay.  Then it hasn't happened.

PATIENT X492
Yeah but.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.

PATIENT X492
But this fainting deal uh, I just.

DOCTOR X492
I know.

PATIENT X492
I mean, my legs felt strong but you know I just feel faint.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.  Have you felt like that at all since then?

PATIENT X492
No, not since then but seemed like after a while, I eat the same breakfast, I eat uh @@@ and one substitute egg, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
Egg whites and uh oatmeal so and uh fiber bread but I don't get an appetite for it, I don't necessarily like it but it's good for me so I wait until I get hungry and that be at least 11 or 12 o'clock so that's when I eat but that particular day I wasn't for the appetite and that's why I ended up eating at 4 o'clock.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
You know what I mean but that was between 11 and 12, to get something in me but that particular day it just happened to be 4 o'clock and when I could of @@@ you know but I understand if you.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
Cause I know what's healthy for me on the breakfast side to eat oatmeal every day so that's like a stress food and it's oats and grains and fiber.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
But I want it in me but you know I don't have the appetite for it.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
You know what I mean.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.  It's not very tasty is it.  Let me take a listen to you @@@ okay.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
Lean forward; see if I can hear through this.  Take a big deep breath.

PATIENT X492
Well do you want @@@.

DOCTOR X492
No it actually doesn't sound that bad.  Take a big deep breath and out again.  And again, last time, good.  Your lungs sound nice and clear.

PATIENT X492
They do?

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh they actually sound good.  Alright well let me talk with my boss and I'll be right back.  @@@.  Did you ever smoke?

PATIENT X492
Yes.

DOCTOR X492
Do you still smoke?

PATIENT X492
No.

DOCTOR X492
Good for you.  Um did they ever check, there is one thing that we, it's more of a new recommendation that just kind of came out in that people who have ever smoked they should get what's called an ultrasound of your stomach uh.

PATIENT X492
For the aorta?

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
Yeah.

DOCTOR X492
@@@.

PATIENT X492
Was that, when was that a year ago or so?

DOCTOR X492
Uh it was a year and a half and it was normal so that's perfect so we do not have to get that.  Okay.  

PATIENT X492
Good.

DOCTOR X492
Alright, let me check in with my boss and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  21:51  DOCTOR IN:  28:42)

DOCTOR X492
Hello.

PATIENT X492
Hello.

DOCTOR X492
How are you today?

PATIENT X492
Good.

DOCTOR X492
Good.  @@@ DOCTOR went over your history and you're doing really well other than you had this isolated episode of where you felt a little bit like you might pass out or you're gonna pass out.

PATIENT X492
Yeah.

DOCTOR X492
Um but you didn't end up on the floor so @@@ felt that maybe you can.

PATIENT X492
Yeah I got feeling like you know I'd be better off in the bed.

DOCTOR X492
Okay and then @@@ well when that happened.

PATIENT X492
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.  Then that's probably what it is of course we're going to do a couple of things to make sure on this end @@@.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
And you haven't had @@@ ever before.

PATIENT X492
Right and then after that I came in and seen the doctor and got a blood pressure machine and so that's what DOCTOR told me.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah, you know what it sound like, it sounds like it's not that bad but it could be a little better, your blood pressure so.  @@@ I don't think @@@ though.  Your dizziness, I don't think the blood pressure is why that happened.

PATIENT X492
Oh no.

DOCTOR X492
I don't think so.

PATIENT X492
Well I know it was about 4 p.m. and I had not fueled myself yet you know.

DOCTOR X492
That's the more likely thing than the blood pressure. Blood pressure you know we see a lot of headaches, sometimes ringing in your ears and you can get a little dizzy.

PATIENT X492
Well that day, that was nine months or so ago, it's probably on record here.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
The next time I @@@.

DOCTOR X492
I'm sure that must be part of it. I mean really it's probably just like a normal isolated event that happened right after you skipped a meal.  If it seemed obvious, it's probably what it is but it's just you know we'll do some things that we probably, it's probably time to do anyway just to be on the safe side but I really wouldn't be concerned unless it happens again.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
But I do want to make sure @@@.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
Take care.

PATIENT X492
Okay.  I had something in mind and it had slipped @@@.  Okay go ahead, maybe it'll come to me.

DOCTOR X492
Okay, so we'll start with your blood pressure okay.

PATIENT X492
Yeah.

DOCTOR X492
We are going to go up on that metoprolol okay.  Like I said you've got plenty of room so don't worry about it.  So we're going to go up from 50 to 75 okay.  It's a @@@ increase, not too bad.  Alright.

PATIENT X492
Oh here's my question.

DOCTOR X492
Yes.

PATIENT X492
Okay you might see in there I'd had a @@@ cholesterol right.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
Well I fixed that well what helped me to fix that was to cut down on that egg and eat the egg whites and a whole lot more stuff and then another thing that helped me was apple cider vinegar.

DOCTOR X492
Oh.

PATIENT X492
The apple cider vinegar could those throw my blood tests out?

DOCTOR X492
Unlikely.  Unlikely.  I know you're trying.

PATIENT X492
Cause that's the thing.  @@@.

DOCTOR X492
It is but.

PATIENT X492
@@@ water.  I tell you what's going in that water.

DOCTOR X492
I'm not going to tell you @@@.

PATIENT X492
@@@ something.

DOCTOR X492
I don't think so.  You know if you want to try it without it then we can.  

PATIENT X492
Cause I got scared of that medicine and I stopped taking it and I had low sodium but I had to read that there wasn't no sodium in there cause I didn't know but I was drinking @@@ there was no sodium and I could not @@@ salt @@@.

DOCTOR X492
I know but @@@ itself that does that.  @@@.  Alright so.

PATIENT X492
@@@.

DOCTOR X492
So that's the blood pressure issue.  Now the other.

PATIENT X492
How did I do that, now I got a pill and I cut it in half?  Is there another pill or something?

DOCTOR X492
Yeah, so what we're going is um, you can take the 50 until you get the new one in the mail okay.

PATIENT X492
Oh and then the new prescription.

DOCTOR X492
Then you'll get.

PATIENT X492
Will take the old one out.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah exactly.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.  Um and then as far as your dizziness, you're just going to have to @@@.  Now as far as your dizziness is concerned, there's a couple things we want to check.  We want to check your labs again to make sure you're not like having anything like low potassium or low magnesium that could cause that dizziness okay.

PATIENT X492
Yeah.

DOCTOR X492
But actually we'll do that.  Okay so we'll do that. The other thing I want to do is you know where you had that ultrasound of your heart done a long time ago?

PATIENT X492
Yes.

DOCTOR X492
So let's just check it again to make sure that nothing new is happening.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
Cause that can also sometimes cause someone to get dizzy okay.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
And I want you to come back and see me in a month okay.  So when you come in and see me in a month we'll see how you're doing with your blood pressure, we'll see how you're doing with that @@@.

PATIENT X492
Well I just go because you know if it's on the schedule cause you can do that 30 days.

DOCTOR X492
Yes you could do it right now before you leave actually.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492
And go get your labs done today and.

PATIENT X492
Well wait a minute, when I gonna get my labs done it may not should I eat before I come.

DOCTOR X492
No it's okay, you don't have to worry about that.

PATIENT X492
@@@.

DOCTOR X492
No we have a new test that actually we can just measure directly in your blood.

PATIENT X492
Good.

DOCTOR X492
@@@ so it's actually nice.

PATIENT X492
It is.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah it is.

PATIENT X492
After this, don't worry about eating and just come in I mean I used to fast sometimes you know.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah.

PATIENT X492
And something like that.

DOCTOR X492
No that and give me a phone number to reach you at in case these tests.

PATIENT X492
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X492
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X492
Okay.  We're all set.  So go ahead and give this to them out front and they'll make you an appointment to come back and see me in a month.  Go get your labs done today and then we can schedule that echo, that ultrasound of your heart.

PATIENT X492
Okay.  Now do I go somewhere to get this echocardiogram, do I do that, go to this schedule.

DOCTOR X492
I think they can tell you up front.  You might have to go to the Heart Station, have you been there, but they'll point you the way.  I'm not sure cause I know sometimes they can schedule you for you here and sometimes it's there.

PATIENT X492
Okay so how many things will I be doing before I leave?

DOCTOR X492
Schedule an appointment with me.  Get your labs and then schedule an appointment with the ultrasound, the echo.

PATIENT X492
Okay now that's sounds @@@.

DOCTOR X492
@@@ not to worry.  Okay.

PATIENT X492
Okay then you'll take it up my prescription?

DOCTOR X492
Uh yes, your prescriptions are done @@@.

PATIENT X492
I mean you know they'll be done in the mail in other words.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

PATIENT X492
So what they do send me 150 and I cut that in half?

DOCTOR X492
I don't know what they do.

PATIENT X492
@@@.

DOCTOR X492
I know they might be.

PATIENT X492
@@@ half pill.

DOCTOR X492
Half pill I know.  I think it usually depends on um, I think it usually depends on what they have on stock you know.

PATIENT X492
Oh I was taking 25, they send me the 50 and half that so when they put in the 50 I just @@@ 100 and cut it in that half.

DOCTOR X492
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X492
@@@ take it all.

DOCTOR X492
I don't know right.

PATIENT X492
@@@ might have to get an increase on the phone huh, emergency now.

DOCTOR X492
Well maybe.

PATIENT X492
And they say okay you got it just take the @@@.

DOCTOR X492
Okay they'll actually watch that so go ahead.  @@@ and I'll see you in, okay, take care sir.

PATIENT X492
Okay.

DOCTOR X492

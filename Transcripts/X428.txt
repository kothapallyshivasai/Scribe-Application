DOCTOR X428
So we haven't seen you since September huh?

PATIENT X428
Was it September, okay.

DOCTOR X428
Uh-huh.  Back then you were having some, you were getting shortness of breath when you were walking so we had you.

PATIENT X428
Oh yeah and that was when uh they took me off those water pills. 

DOCTOR X428
Oh right.

PATIENT X428
Yeah and that seemed to did it.

DOCTOR X428
Really.

PATIENT X428
You know, it looks like they was making me feel tired.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.

PATIENT X428
Yeah so I feel better now but uh.

DOCTOR X428
You feel better now?

PATIENT X428
Yes.

DOCTOR X428
So you think it was going off that water pill that did it?

PATIENT X428
I think why.  At first I thought it was the @@@ but it was doing it, it make me feel tired you know.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.

PATIENT X428
But uh the water pills, he cut me, he took me off the water pills.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.

PATIENT X428
I was taking a half of them.

DOCTOR X428
Right, right and we just stopped it all together.

PATIENT X428
Right.

DOCTOR X428
Right.

PATIENT X428
And then too I had a little notation here that, uh I was a little tired and @@@ a little stronger.  Okay it was a medicine that I may cancel, uh @@@. 

DOCTOR X428
You want to get rid of some medicines?

PATIENT X428
Yeah I wants to know if there are any that I shouldn't have, shouldn't take.

DOCTOR X428
You shouldn't have any more.

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X428
Well what are you taking right now?  Cause I have a list here but.

PATIENT X428
I take uh about six different medicines now, including the aspirin.  I take uh omeprazole and not the white pills.

DOCTOR X428
Lisinopril?

PATIENT X428
Yeah for the cholesterol.

DOCTOR X428
The simvastatin.  You need that one.

PATIENT X428
Yeah I need that one and uh.

DOCTOR X428
The lisinopril you need to.

PATIENT X428
The what?

DOCTOR X428
The lisinopril for your blood pressure.

PATIENT X428
Oh right yeah.

DOCTOR X428
Um I was actually thinking we might want to increase that today because your blood pressures have been high.

PATIENT X428
Yeah and there too, I got a notation of my blood pressures.

DOCTOR X428
Oh good that you have this.

PATIENT X428
Uh it's somewhat yeah but he was changing it the last time but he said I was a little late.  

DOCTOR X428
Yeah so it's just, it's running a little on the high side.  Not bad but you know 140s, 150s, I'm seeing a lot of those.  So I think we could go up on the lisinopril cause I think you need to uh.

PATIENT X428
Okay and uh you know I don't feel no pain or nothing but for the last about couple two or three weeks it feels like a little blood around my @@@.

DOCTOR X428
Blood in there.

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh I told the lady about it that was taking my blood pressure a while ago.

DOCTOR X428
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X428
And she said tell the doctor.

DOCTOR X428
Yeah that's fine.  But it feels like, does it feel like it's going back or?

PATIENT X428
Uh it feels like, just like when I take a belch it uh, then it feels better you know.  There's no pain just a lot of @@@ right here.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.  Can you feel it beating?  Does it feel like it beats faster or does it skip beats or?

PATIENT X428
It now that seems like a little thing and then sometimes it will skip a lot of beats though.

DOCTOR X428
It feels like you skip a beat okay.  @@@.  When does it usually happen?

PATIENT X428
Oh it just, it mostly uh when I do a little extra work uh moving around you know.

DOCTOR X428
When you're moving around.

PATIENT X428
I feel it.

DOCTOR X428
Do you exercise?

PATIENT X428
No, no.

DOCTOR X428
Do you up stairs much?

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh I got stairs.

DOCTOR X428
Do you get it more when you go up the stairs?  At that point?

PATIENT X428
Just when I get a little tired, doing a little extra work or something.

DOCTOR X428
Doing a little extra work okay.  

PATIENT X428
There's no pain just it feels like it's just a flutter.

DOCTOR X428
Fluttering.

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X428
Right.

PATIENT X428
And when I think that like I belch or something like that uh and then it feels like it goes away.

DOCTOR X428
Better when you belch okay.  It feels regular now but you don't feel it right now right?  

PATIENT X428
No.

DOCTOR X428
You're not feeling it right now the flutters?

PATIENT X428
No, no.  Off and on.

DOCTOR X428
Off and on.  How many times do you get it?  The flutters?

PATIENT X428
Oh practically uh every day.

DOCTOR X428
About every day.

PATIENT X428
Yeah off and on.  And sometimes I was wondering if wasn't gas or when I'm having it or something.

DOCTOR X428
Well I mean it's getting better with belching it sounds like it could be gas but the fluttering and feeling like it might skip a beat.

PATIENT X428
Hmm.

DOCTOR X428
That's sounds more like the heart and it's not uncommon actually to have skipped beats.

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X428
I get them sometimes too.  I can feel it.  Um if you get it, it's a normal thing.  It's not a big deal.

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X428
Um but when it happens more often or you start to feel short of breath.

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X428
Or pain or you start to have symptoms because of it then we start to worry.

PATIENT X428
Hmm.

DOCTOR X428
Um so I don't know.

PATIENT X428
There's no pain.

DOCTOR X428
No pain at all.

PATIENT X428
No pain.  Cause I have a certain alert related to my service that uh you know before I went in the service the doctor told me I had to go to a doctor once and he said uh the Army would never take you.  Oh I said why and he says because you have a weakness of the heart and then he said well if you happen to live right he says because at your age you would outgrow it.

DOCTOR X428
Oh okay.

PATIENT X428
So like when I went into the service I took my physical to go into the service and in the service the doctor looked at what the other doctor had told me a few years ago and he said no, he said your heart is alright now.

DOCTOR X428
Yeah.  We've looked at your heart a few times and it looks okay.

PATIENT X428
Yeah.

DOCTOR X428
Actually it looks okay.

PATIENT X428
He said if you had a weakened heart we would not take you in here.  I think I have all of the questions that I had to ask you right here oh yeah.  And you think I should increase what'd you say the, what is that uh cholesterol.

DOCTOR X428
No the lisinopril it's the blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT X428
Oh for the blood pressure.

DOCTOR X428
And it helps you with depression too.

PATIENT X428
Yeah.

DOCTOR X428
It helps your heart.  It's a good medicine.

PATIENT X428
Hmm.

DOCTOR X428
Alright so what I'll do here for you so I think we can increase that.  Do you need refills on anything else?

PATIENT X428
Oh, oh I think I actually I need refills on practically all of them but see I have some medicine but I think they all is low.  They need to be updated.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.  Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X428
No, no, I don't smoke and don't drink no more cause they told me not to drink and don't smoke.

DOCTOR X428
When did you quit smoking?

PATIENT X428
Oh 201, that's when I was told.

DOCTOR X428
Oh great.

PATIENT X428
And then I told them I quit drinking then they asked because I was a heavy drinking and I said I wasn't gonna throw it away but I said when I finish I would stop.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.

PATIENT X428
Then I ended up stopping for maybe a couple years and then I started back for about six months and then I stopped again and that's it.

DOCTOR X428
Okay so you've stopped for good.

PATIENT X428
I have.

DOCTOR X428
That's great news.

PATIENT X428
Hung it up for good.

DOCTOR X428
Well that's great.  Okay.  And you never and you've had high blood pressure for now long?

PATIENT X428
Oh I don't know but it was during the time I was drinking they said that my blood pressure was high but I think it was because I was a heavy drinker.

DOCTOR X428
Yeah.

PATIENT X428
And uh that had something to do with it but now it, at first it was would kind of be normal like you know.

DOCTOR X428
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X428
But then all of a sudden it started going back up again.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.  So yeah.

PATIENT X428
And I know she checked it over here just a while ago and it seemed to be high.  I guess because I told her I had been drinking some coffee this morning and then she took it again and it was, it was much better.

DOCTOR X428
It was better yeah.  Still a little high.

PATIENT X428
Yeah.

DOCTOR X428
We can get it better but it's not bad.  It's actually not bad.  Have you thought about whether you want to do a colonoscopy for the colon cancer screening?

PATIENT X428
Uh.

DOCTOR X428
We talked about it last time.

PATIENT X428
Yeah for the colon uh now I don't have no problem uh you know, no pain around my rectum and I don't have no bleeding and nothing like that but.

DOCTOR X428
Yeah.

PATIENT X428
So uh I'd just rather hold off on that for a while.

DOCTOR X428
You don't want to do it okay.

PATIENT X428
And what you call the other prostate I had that and it came out good.

DOCTOR X428
Yeah, yeah it looks okay alright.

PATIENT X428
So I had that.

DOCTOR X428
Have you had your flu shots?

PATIENT X428
No.  I had one shot she gave me but they didn't have the swine flu, you know what you call it, the swine.

DOCTOR X428
H1N1?

PATIENT X428
Yeah they didn't have that in at the time.

DOCTOR X428
You want to get that today?

PATIENT X428
Yeah I can get that shot.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.

PATIENT X428
If it's not free I don't want it.

DOCTOR X428
I had to get it.  It's actually a little bit more mild than the other two shots.

PATIENT X428
Yeah.

DOCTOR X428
Depending on where you have it.

PATIENT X428
I know that they was talking about it they had to send it back in and it wasn't right or something like that.

DOCTOR X428
Oh yeah right.

PATIENT X428
But I guess they got all that straightened out.

DOCTOR X428
I think they got it straightened out.  They got it straightened out.  So you were taking medicine for your stomach for your acid reflux before called omeprazole.

PATIENT X428
Yes.

DOCTOR X428
Or Prilosec or Prevacid kind of thing.

PATIENT X428
Yeah that's what I was concerned about.  Now what was that really for?

DOCTOR X428
You were having reflux, the acid reflux symptoms.  I think that was why you were on it.  Do you tend to have it?

PATIENT X428
It was a capsule.

DOCTOR X428
Yeah.

PATIENT X428
No uh I think I was taking it because I was a heavy, used to be a heavy drinker and it what is it for, for gas or what?

DOCTOR X428
It suppresses the acid in the stomach so there's less acid in the stomach which means you get less symptoms of reflux coming up that would cause you know like burning you know belching, getting up at night, mainly burning pain at night and after meals.

PATIENT X428
Now I.

DOCTOR X428
Are you having any problems with that?

PATIENT X428
The only problem I have mostly is like a try to clear my throat like that.

DOCTOR X428
Okay.

PATIENT X428
And.

DOCTOR X428
But at night do you get burning sensation or a taste in the back of your mouth?

PATIENT X428
No.

DOCTOR X428
Okay so you probably don't need it anymore.

PATIENT X428
Yeah that's the only thing.  I thought it was for; for like to clear my throat like at sometime I had the and uh do that.

DOCTOR X428
Hmm.

PATIENT X428
But otherwise if it was for acid or something coming up I mean.

DOCTOR X428
You don't need that okay.  

PATIENT X428
But I still have some, @@@.  You know I taste them.

DOCTOR X428
But you can take it you want to if you feel that.

PATIENT X428
Uh it'd be up to it's just really up to me.

DOCTOR X428
Yeah you can choose.

PATIENT X428
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X428
I mean if you start to get that burning, acid reflux.

PATIENT X428
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X428
You know right after you eat a meal you just.

PATIENT X428
The gas.

DOCTOR X428
Gas.  Pain you can take then.

PATIENT X428
Sometime I was wondering if that was caused my heart you know.

DOCTOR X428
Well the fluttering probably not but you know like if it's skipping a beat.

PATIENT X428
Yeah and it just goes like something like fluttering when I'm.

DOCTOR X428

DOCTOR X428

DOCTOR X279
Is that's true?

PATIENT X279
That's true yes.

DOCTOR X279
Okay so what brings you to the clinic today?

PATIENT X279
Well blood pressure basically, chest pains.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  Okay so tell me when does it start, what's happening?

SECOND PERSON X279
Did read any of the prior notes?

DOCTOR X279
So let's see.

SECOND PERSON X279
We faxed some tests results.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Been talking back and forth with DOCTOR um, he's had some elevated blood pressure readings.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
Uh chest pain.  Uh he had an epidural on Friday and because we were here they told us to come in after he was done.

PATIENT X279
Done here.

SECONDD PERSON X279
And of course because he had @@@ um his blood pressure was fine when he was here.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Over this weekend uh, quite frankly, he had a horrible weekend, especially Friday night.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
Tachycardia of 122, uh blood pressure was quite elevated, uh 180/112 um.  He didn't have increased respirations.

DOCTOR X279
@@@.

SECONDD PERSON X279.
He didn't have increased respirations but um I had him taking nitro.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
Which he's not prone to do because it gives him such a headache.  Um but uh this is something that's been going on for a while.

DOCTOR X279
So all of a sudden your blood pressure goes up and then you have chest pain?

SECOND PERSON X279
No it's been going up uh on a regular basis.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Um.  Spoke to her.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
Um couple of times, uh she said well we'll do a follow-up appointment, that's not until March 16th.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
Things got worse, I gave her a call um, faxed her the test results and she said um she could talk to the attending and get back to me and I never heard anything.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
So then I spoke to NAME several times trying to get down to the bottom of it because um quite frankly, well Friday night on a scale of 1-10, uh he probably was at a 20.

DOCTOR X279
In pain?

SECOND PERSON X279
In pain.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Uh, continuing over the weekend, his blood pressure was elevated.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Pulse anywhere from 90 to 102.

DOCTOR X279
And the whole time you're having chest pains?

PATIENT X279
Yeah I have, actually dear I'm having chest pain right now.

DOCTOR X279
Right now you're having chest pain?

PATIENT X279
Yeah.  They don't, they elevated.  They come but they don't ever completely go away.  They've been that way for a while now.

DOCTOR X279
And on a scale of 1-10 how bad is the chest pain?

PATIENT X279
Right now, probably a 5.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
And that's about the lowest that they go.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  Okay and how long has, you said this is gradually getting worse.  How long has this been happening?

PATIENT X279
Probably the better part of a good month, maybe a little longer.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
I see DOCTOR in the fall.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah and he gave.

PATIENT X279
And my blood pressure was starting to give me problems then.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
And she decided to add another blood pressure pill to the regimen I was already on.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
So I take like 20 mg at night when I go to bed.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
But regardless taking it in the morning or taking it at night together, uh it's like all weekend long my blood pressure was systolic wise it was in the 150s, low 160s.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah, so it's been suddenly just been going up?

PATIENT X279
Yeah.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  So what are you on, let's see you're on diltiazem, why are you on diltiazem?  Is that just for blood pressure?

PATIENT X279
No my heart.

DOCTOR X279
Well why?

PATIENT X279
I have a bad valve.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
And he has coronary artery spasms.

DOCTOR X279
So how did they diagnosis the coronary artery spasm?

SECOND PERSON X279
Angio.

DOCTOR X279
Okay and they saw that.

SECOND PERSON X279
Right at the time it was happening.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Cause he's had heart attacks in the past but they could never find anything.

PATIENT X279
Because they never could catch it when it was going on at the exact time.

DOCTOR X279
Okay and then they did a cath and it was negative and that was in 2009.

PATIENT X279
No in 2009 they did a cath.

DOCTOR X279
Yes.

PATIENT X279
And it was.

DOCTOR X279
They saw spasms.

PATIENT X279
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
They finally saw it.  He had had prior heart attacks.

DOCTOR X279
Oh.

SECOND PERSON X279
But nobody ever saw anything.

DOCTOR X279
Oh and finally.

PATIENT X279
Yeah DOCTOR found it, that was down at xxx xxx Hospital.

DOCTOR X279
Oh.

PATIENT X279
xxx xxx xxx, Florida.  Yeah when NAME took my blood pressure at home, we got here, what was it against the VA.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah it was 148/102.

PATIENT X279
And she took it just before we left the house to come here and it was 161/102.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  Well yeah, you're not, it's not really been under control hmm.  Okay, well a couple of things.  When was the last time you had an EKG and a lot of other things for you?  And if you're having active chest pain.

PATIENT X279
I mean when I had the epidural on Friday.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
They hooked, because of my heart the way it is, they didn't want to take any precautions so they made me have the epidural in the OR.

SECOND PERSON X279
Basically he's had no testing.  

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
She did say to me when was his last stress test?

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
I said it was probably at least 2 1/2 years ago.
PATIENT X279
It would have been in November of 09.

SECOND PERSON X279
Yeah.

DOCTOR X279
So then okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
And again she was going to talk to the attending and get back to me and I have never heard.

PATIENT X279
But we never heard from her.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah what testing have you gotten so far?  You said that you had.

PATIENT X279
DOCTOR when I first started coming into the VA.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
Now you said that you faxed something to us, what did you fax to us?

SECOND PERSON X279
I faxed um.

PATIENT X279
I bet it's not in the computer.

DOCTOR X279
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X279
An EKG, an echocardiogram report um.

PATIENT X279
You brought it with you didn't you?

SECOND PERSON X279
Yeah.

PATIENT X279
Yeah that's what I thought.

DOCTOR X279
May I take a look at those?

PATIENT X279
Those were just done in January.

DOCTOR X279
Now this chest pain is it worse when you're walking around or do you just notice it worse when your blood pressure is higher.  Is it chest pain and where is it?  Is it on the left side; is it on the right side?

PATIENT X279
It moves.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
So like right now it's bothering me like right in here.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
Sometimes it's in here.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
Sometimes it's in here and goes down my arm.

DOCTOR X279
Oh okay.  And is it worse with the blood pressure, you notice if the blood pressure is high that's when your chest pain is worse?

PATIENT X279
If I'm just sitting down totally relaxed, we'll say watching television or reading a book.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
I could still be sitting here having chest pain.  I get up and move around, especially here of late maybe the last week, 10 days, all of a sudden I'll find myself getting short of breath.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
And then the pain elevates so I'm sure if I go back and take my blood pressure or have NAME take it.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah, it would be high.

PATIENT X279
Uh.

DOCTOR X279
So you think it's associated with your blood pressure.

PATIENT X279
Oh I don't think there's any way around it.  I, but like I was saying when I had the epidural on Friday morning.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
And they had me all hooked up, I don't know if that's actually the case, but they were watching my heart.

DOCTOR X279
Well yeah but that's not an EKG.

PATIENT X279
So what they didn't see anything per se or they wouldn't of did the epidural.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
So.

DOCTOR X279
And that was your blood pressure right, @@@ in the clinic.

PATIENT X279
Right.  Now I see DOCTOR this week as a matter of fact.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
Thursday.

DOCTOR X279
So one of the things is your chronic low back pain is why they did the epidural.

PATIENT X279
Correct.

SECOND PERSON X279
Lower back pain.  He has a right rotator cuff.

DOCTOR X279
Oh.  So what's wrong with your mitral valve?  Do you know?

PATIENT X279
I got everything that DOCTOR ever did on my heart but I didn't bring all that in here.  It should be in the computer from DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
She had all my records at one time.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah and none of this, any of this, there's no echo or anything here.  This is all from different things.

SECOND PERSON X279
There's an echo there.  It might be on the other side.

DOCTOR X279
Oh I see.  They're all double-sided.

PATIENT X279
Yeah see this number right here concerned me.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
So.

DOCTOR X279
Okay here's your echo.  So where did you get all this stuff done?

SECOND PERSON X279
xxx.

DOCTOR X279
Did you see a doctor at xxx?

SECOND PERSON X279
No it was uh basically to get a baseline for ourselves.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
Cause he has a triple A.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
And because he has such severe back pain I kind of wanted some, I'm an RN.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
I kind of wanted to know when it was back pain and when we had to worry about triple A.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
So, DOCTOR you now.

PATIENT X279
So basically what we did was.

SECOND PERSON X279
To know the size of the aneurysm now.

DOCTOR X279
You have results.  Well why have them, all this could be done here at the VA?

SECOND PERSON X279
Good question.

PATIENT X279
I begged DOCTOR to send me to a cardiologist last fall and she came back in and said they didn't.

SECOND PERSON X279
She could take care of it herself.

PATIENT X279
Yeah and they never sent me to him.

DOCTOR X279
Okay so how did you get this?  Who did you see at xxx?

SECOND PERSON X279
This was just like a clinic where you pay for it.

DOCTOR X279
Oh you didn't get all the like.

SECOND PERSON X279
It's a Sunday clinic, some yeah.

PATIENT X279
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
We didn't get with DOCTOR you just have to pay for it.

DOCTOR X279
I see.  Um so how long ago was all this?  Oh January 11th.

PATIENT X279
Yeah, what a month ago.  A month and what two days.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
It would have been wonderful that they did something here but it's not from the lack of us asking for it.

DOCTOR X279
The way they are reporting these things are kind of sketchy.

SECOND PERSON X279
Yeah.

PATIENT X279
Basically though that's more like a baseline to like bring to you or to a cardiologist.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

PATIENT X279
So that they have an idea because there's stuff in there that should have been followed up on so.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah and you have some diastolic dysfunction but that's kind of expected when you've had a history of heart disease and that whole thing.

SECOND PERSON X279
She made a comment about um, uh because of his triglyceride level.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
That she should change him off the simvastatin and put him on something else but she said again she needed to talk to the attending and then I never heard nothing.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.  I'm actually looking at your most recent lipids and you look okay.  They actually look more than fine.

PATIENT X279
Those were a year ago.

DOCTOR X279
February yeah.

PATIENT X279
So it was a year ago, DOCTOR ordered all that blood work.  That was a year ago.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
There's a lipid panel in those papers.

PATIENT X279
Yeah see I wouldn't, she was, what then NAME told us on Friday when we came in.

DOCTOR X279
Now this just says that, it doesn't give me the numbers it just said that your numbers were normal.

SECOND PERSON X279
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X279
Yeah I mean she said she was going to talk to DOCTOR Friday afternoon cause she wasn't here when we were here.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
And have her call us and.

SECOND PERSON X279
Never called.

PATIENT X279
Then again we never heard from her.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
So I.  NAME did get this appointment scheduled today.  Obviously we're in here seeing.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

PATIENT X279
To see you because it was the only thing she could find available.

DOCTOR X279
It was the only thing open.

PATIENT X279
Right.

SECOND PERSON X279
And the EKG here was faxed in with his symptoms which.

DOCTOR X279
And the EKG.

SECOND PERSON X279
They didn't really give us; they didn't really give us a report on the EKG so.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah and you're triglycerides look like they're a little high but actually we don't really treat triglycerides other than.

SECOND PERSON X279
@@@ what she said yeah.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.  So they're not really, we wouldn't do anything about that.

SECOND PERSON X279
Well she may be telling us about the simvastatin so.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.  Um let's see.  And then you're @@@ asthma too.

SECOND PERSON X279
And then that obviously we need to get the blood pressure more under control and we got that.

DOCTOR X279
Right.  Well okay and right now you're saying you're having a 5 out of 10 chest pain?

PATIENT X279
Uh-huh.  If I get up and start moving around very much it'll get worse.

DOCTOR X279
It does.

PATIENT X279
Oh yeah.  I guarantee you it will.

DOCTOR X279
Is it similar to the coronary stabbing pain you had before?

PATIENT X279
Um you mean as far as me actually having, like call 911 and have the ambulance come and get me?

DOCTOR X279
Yes.

PATIENT X279
Normally if it goes all the way out, I mean it looks, it feels, it's the worst pain you could ever imagine in your life.  It's like an elephant sat down on my chest.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
But normally it'll make me sick and then it's like I'll break out into what a hard sweat within seconds, maybe a minute, you'd think somebody poured a bucket of water on me.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
If I'm laying in bed the whole bed will be soaked.  If I'm sitting on the chair like this, there'll be a puddle underneath me.

DOCTOR X279
Well what I would do is get a troponin and EKG.  If you're having active chest pain we have to look at that.  Um and then I would order a stress test and if you're really having chest pain with angina and you know sometimes we would consider sending people with these symptoms to Cardiology to get a cath.

SECOND PERSON X279
Okay.

DOCTOR X279
Um so let me talk with my attending.

PATIENT X279
Yeah because see I don't know if DOCTOR showed him any of this stuff.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
Or her or what @@@.  I haven't cause she never responded back to us again.

DOCTOR X279
And maybe because, you know the residents aren't always here so I'm not sure what rotation she's on, you know a lot of these things um.

PATIENT X279
I don't know what she said.

SECOND PERSON X279
No I know she was there that afternoon, Friday afternoon and we left at 12:30 and she was just coming in so I know that she had that afternoon she could have called me and I had talked to her on Wednesday.  Thursday she was there.

DOCTOR X279
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X279
Um so I mean, I don't want to completely uh says she you know.

PATIENT X279
It's more; again she didn't return any calls.

SECOND PERSON X279
And DOCTOR had NAME call me and tell me we're not sure what to do yet.

DOCTOR X279
Right.  Well have a seat here, let me just examine you.  I'm going to send to get another EKG for our records and I'm going to have @@@.

PATIENT X279
You need me to take my shirt off here?

DOCTOR X279
Yeah that would be helpful.  Either way when they do the EKG they'll probably need that.

PATIENT X279
Oh they'll have me take it off, yeah sure.

DOCTOR X279
But I don't know they may not do it in here though so, actually just keep it on, I'll lift it to examine and then they'll have you take it all the way off cause you may have to move to the front room so.  Deep breath.  You said about a month you've been noticing this right?

PATIENT X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
Sometime about a month, around there yeah.

DOCTOR X279
Can I get you to lay back down here?  So it's worse with exertion and when your blood pressure is up?

PATIENT X279
Yep.

DOCTOR X279
And right now how's your back pain?

PATIENT X279
Um I'm a little sore but I mean that's why they gave me the epidural.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  So no.

PATIENT X279
I'm not in as much pain in my lower back.

DOCTOR X279
No belly pain?  And point to your chest pain again?

PATIENT X279
Right now?

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

PATIENT X279
It's right in here.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
It's right here.

DOCTOR X279
Alright.  Does it hurt when I push down at all?  Any pain to that area?

PATIENT X279
I can feel that, yeah.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  Did it feel like the pain that you're having?

PATIENT X279
Yeah.

DOCTOR X279
It does?

PATIENT X279
Yeah.  See like you hit right here I feel that.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
When you get down in here I feel that.

DOCTOR X279
So that's the pain that you're feeling?

PATIENT X279
Yes.

DOCTOR X279
Okay so that actually makes me a lot less concerned.  When you have something, so what this is called is reproducible chest pain and when you have something reproducible chest pain it's a lot less concerning.  They think it's more of a muscle spasm versus your heart.

PATIENT X279
Ah, I disagree.

DOCTOR X279
Well when I push down it hurts right?

PATIENT X279
No not necessarily.  I feel it.

DOCTOR X279
You feel it but it's not the same pain that you're feeling?

PATIENT X279
No.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  Cause you feel it here too right?

PATIENT X279
Yes.

DOCTOR X279
Okay but it's not the same pain that you'll have in your chest.

PATIENT X279
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X279
He usually has it like right here.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X279
And then right epigastric.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Oh left I'm sorry.

DOCTOR X279
Left chest okay and its worse when you're running around, going upstairs and its worse with high blood pressure.  What about eating or laying down, does that bring relief?

PATIENT X279
Yeah, I mean.  I'm smart enough to know because I take something for stomach anyway.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah for GERD or something like that.  This is definitely not that.

PATIENT X279
No, no.  Um it's not gastric.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
If that's what you're asking me.

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

PATIENT X279
So that's what, in the beginning that's what I thought.

DOCTOR X279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X279
That it was gastric pain because I was getting so much of it in here.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.

PATIENT X279
But no and it's different.  I know I've had going back and forth in my stomach for years.

DOCTOR X279
Okay.  Well let me, um come with me cause I want you to get an EKG and I'll talk to my boss.  DOCTOR will see you and he'll bring you back to my room when he's finished.

SECOND PERSON X279
Okay thank you very much.

(DOCTOR OUT:  91:00 DOCTOR IN:  95:54)

DOCTOR X279
After you get the EKG um, it's @@@ with me right now okay. So I talked with my attending and we think its best that you actually go to the Emergency Department right away.  There's a couple of lab tests that I wanted to order and it just happens a lot quicker if you just go there.  So after you get, you are going to get the EKG right now and then just go.

PATIENT X279
Do you agree with it?

DOCTOR X279
Yeah.

PATIENT X279
Okay.

DOCTOR X279
And we can make sure that there's not any, it's just easier like if you're there to just hook him up to get another EKG there.

SECOND PERSON X279
Okay.  Why is that?

DOCTOR X279
And then after that go to the Emergency Department.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X279
So what blood tests?  

DOCTOR X279
So it's like a Troponin, that kind of thing.  They'll evaluate @@@, they'll get a chest x-ray right away, right away so the doctors can look at it right away um you know and they'll see the EKG that we did.

SECOND PERSON X279
Will they send that to you?

DOCTOR X279
You mean the EKG that we ordered?

SECOND PERSON X279
Will they send that on to you or?

DOCTOR X279
Yeah, um they'll contact DOCTOR since she's your doctor but they'll take care of you down there, anything they can do to help me and like that stress test I'm just going to go ahead and order it now.

SECOND PERSON X279
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X279
Um and they'll schedule that for you.

SECOND PERSON X279
Okay.

DOCTOR X279
Okay but after NAME does this we'll send you down there.  I just want to make sure there's nothing very obvious on here okay.

SECOND PERSON X279
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X279
Okay I'll be right in here.  

(Patient is getting an EKG in the room)

Patient is taken to the Emergency Department.

Time is 12:25.

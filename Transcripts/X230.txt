No, not really.  I uh just got back from Arizona.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
I spent eight months over there.  Uh they got me here with some medication that I couldn't get here but I got it over there, why I don't know.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.  Are you still working out?

PATIENT X230
I try, yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.  How many times a week?

PATIENT X230
Well right now I'm trying to go twice a week.  I used to go three times but uh the last 2 1/2 years, I don't know if you remember but my wife had those strokes and she had another one in 09.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
That's why we went to Arizona for the winter last year.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
And uh we had to come back here because uh Medicare.  We had to be here in Illinois.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
We just got back here in December.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
Which I hated it, to come back.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.  Well let’s see here, so you're still getting your alprazolam here.

PATIENT X230
There's one medication that came here a couple of weeks back that one of the doctors wanted canceled.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
Uh, well I don't pronounce those words.

DOCTOR X230
Doxycycline?

PATIENT X230
Yeah.

DOCTOR X230
Now why are you taking that?

PATIENT X230
Because of my nose, it breaks out.

DOCTOR X230
Oh okay.

PATIENT X230
I get uh blisters.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
And uh this was recommended by Dermatology.

DOCTOR X230
Right.

PATIENT X230
Now when I, this doctor said it's no good, it could cause problems later on.

DOCTOR X230
Well it can.  How often do you use it?

PATIENT X230
Well as long as nothing pops up on my nose I don't take it.

DOCTOR X230
Right.

PATIENT X230
Sometimes I take three times a week, sometimes twice, all depends.  When I see my nose breaking out that's when I take the medication.

DOCTOR X230
So are you taking 100 mg of metoprolol now?  Cause we have you on 200 here.

PATIENT X230
Uh, what does that say 200?

DOCTOR X230
It says 100.

PATIENT X230
100 yeah.

DOCTOR X230
And we have 200.

PATIENT X230
Yeah but I've been taking half of it.

DOCTOR X230
You take half a pill?

PATIENT X230
I've been taking half of it right.

DOCTOR X230
Alright let me just change that cause.

PATIENT X230
I should have brought the bottle.

DOCTOR X230
Alright.

PATIENT X230
Now this here, this one here.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
Medication.

DOCTOR X230
The oxybutynin?

PATIENT X230
Yeah uh was given to me because a couple of times I find myself uh wet at night.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
The pajamas or I couldn't hold it so I stopped at the VA over there in Arizona and they says no you don't have an infection it just could be your bladder and I've been taking that too as I need it.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
Now one thing I don't understand.

DOCTOR X230
Yeah.

PATIENT X230
Uh the VA Hospital, as far as I understand, regardless of where they are, you should honor the other place, their instructions or whatever.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
I was there and I didn't have no problem.  They registered me right away.  Uh I went to the hospital; they assigned me to a doctor.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
I came here and I ran a couple medications and they wouldn't give them to me, they said no, no you have to see a doctor.

DOCTOR X230
Well you know I have to actually renew the medicines.  I have to put in the order otherwise the Pharmacy can't fill it.  So that might have been what happened.

PATIENT X230
Yeah but if I, I can see if I'm out completely that I have to renew it but if it's still good, the bottle says renew a couple of more times or whatever.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
Why when I.

DOCTOR X230
I don't know the answer to that.  That's weird cause.  I don't really know.

PATIENT X230
Why isn't that particular medication that I'm telling you about my nose?

DOCTOR X230
Yeah that one had expired in our system.  That's why you couldn't get it.

PATIENT X230
Oh.

DOCTOR X230
So it needed to be reordered by a doctor and I've done that.

PATIENT X230
And then he only gave me enough, he gave me nine pills only.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
Like I say I take that when my nose breaks out.

DOCTOR X230
Right.  Alright and then are you doing the aspirin through the VA?

PATIENT X230
No.  

DOCTOR X230
You're just buying that over-the-counter?

PATIENT X230
You cut me off.

DOCTOR X230
Well you can get it here.  It's probably cheaper to just buy it over-the-counter.

PATIENT X230
Its cheaper buying over-the-counter yes, that's alright.  I can handle that one.

DOCTOR X230
I mean I can order it for you through here.

PATIENT X230
No I'll get it.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
Uh the uh, the softener.

DOCTOR X230
Yeah.  I reordered that.

PATIENT X230
You did, good.  Cause they canceled me here one time and then I just noticed I still got it here.  Now the other medication that I'm taking is um like complex vitamin B.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
And stuff like that.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X230
Those were recommended by the cardiologist.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
And I'm still taking that.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
Yeah the one medication that is.

DOCTOR X230
The saw palmetto that's an over-the-counter thing.

PATIENT X230
Uh the one medication that I don't have here.

DOCTOR X230

PATIENT X230
Yeah.

DOCTOR X230
Yeah we don't have that here.  That's not in our pharmacy.

PATIENT X230
And that baby's expensive.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.  That's why we don't have it in our pharmacy.

PATIENT X230
And I been taking that since I had my bypass.

DOCTOR X230
Uh-huh.  I can see if I can get it.

PATIENT X230
I had a uh blood work over there and I'm always concerned about my prostate and according to them it was real good, it was 1. something.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.  How much of the Lovaza are you on?  Do you remember?

PATIENT X230
No it's not, I don't have it here.  I'm surprised, yeah wait a minute, wait a minute.  That's my wife's list.  I thought I had everything in order, 1 mg.

DOCTOR X230
Is that daily?  Once a day?

PATIENT X230
This?  Again I take it three times a week, four times a week because it's expensive.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.

PATIENT X230
See the metoprolol, I got it here as a half.

DOCTOR X230
Okay.  Alright, have you eaten today?

DOCTOR X546
Cause it looks like I don't see you're running low for your medication though so, why was your blood pressure high?

PATIENT X546
I don't know.  I'll be honest, I won't lie, I been taking my medicine, the blood pressure probably every other night.

DOCTOR X546
Why?

PATIENT X546
Because some nights I just forget.

DOCTOR X546
You forget?

PATIENT X546
Yeah and I like taking it at night rather than getting up and taking it in the morning, you know since I @@@ well I got to take my medicines at night and then you fall asleep and don't take it.

DOCTOR X546
But like this one, do you take the one for your stomach in the morning?

PATIENT X546
For my stomach, let's see.  I have so many pills.

DOCTOR X546
The omeprazole the one for your reflux.

PATIENT X546
Is that a little white pill?

DOCTOR X546
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X546
I take it at night.

DOCTOR X546
What are you doing taking it at night cause you're not eating it isn't doing any good?  It works better to take them during the day.

PATIENT X546
I could switch it around and take them all in the day.  I want to be able to take them all at the same time.

DOCTOR X546
Um let's see.  I guess the only one, I mean you just want it so you don't forget and your blood pressure right now, I don't know if it's because you're not taking it or if it's not working.

PATIENT X546
No it's working cause the last.

DOCTOR X546
That's not what it said though.

PATIENT X546
Right, the last time I been here they said it was super good.

DOCTOR X546
That it was good.

PATIENT X546
Right.

DOCTOR X546
Okay.

PATIENT X546
It's working, it's just I got to get back on my, get on my horse and my schedule to take it.

DOCTOR X546
Okay.

PATIENT X546
I need some more of that heartburn medicine.

DOCTOR X546
Uh-huh I'll give you all of them.

PATIENT X546
Mail them cause I need to get to the cashier before 4 o'clock.

DOCTOR X546
Do you need insulin too?

PATIENT X546
Uh.

DOCTOR X546
Do you everything refilled?

PATIENT X546
I remember about them telling me about the insulin that I was warned that it could pull, I been taking it and it would be too much for me.  In other words insulin brings down your blood sugar correct?

DOCTOR X546
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X546
Okay.  They were concerned if I would be taking the insulin bringing it down too low.

DOCTOR X546
Um well the last time we did the hemoglobin test it was really good so it's more like it's maybe too good.

PATIENT X546
It's too good?  Alright I cut back on the insulin like every other day.

DOCTOR X546
What are you using right now?

PATIENT X546
30 units Humulin N.

DOCTOR X546
Oh and how long were you doing this?

PATIENT X546
If I go back to shooting myself every day I can order me another bottle because I went back to taking it every other day.

DOCTOR X546
So what are you doing right now?

PATIENT X546
Every other day.  I'm going to go back to taking it.

DOCTOR X546
Once a day?

PATIENT X546
Yeah.

DOCTOR X546
And that's it?

PATIENT X546
Right, that's what I'm going to go back to taking it once a day instead of every other day.

DOCTOR X546
How about this, give me your phone number, we'll check today to see what your sugar has been in the last three months.  If it's a lot worse then we'll go back to every day okay.  So keep doing what you're doing now.

PATIENT X546
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X546
And then I'll call you and let you know what to do.

PATIENT X546
Okay you have my phone number don't you?

DOCTOR X546
Is it the same one?

PATIENT X546
Yeah it hasn't changed.

DOCTOR X546
Uh NUMBER.

PATIENT X546
No.

DOCTOR X546
NUMBER.

PATIENT X546
That's it, that's it.

DOCTOR X546
So this one and this one.  If you get this bottle of insulin though @@@  make sure you check your sugars every other day.  You can refill them @@@ in the future.

PATIENT X546
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X546
Cause once it's low.

PATIENT X546
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X546
You can go in and get a full bottle.

PATIENT X546

DOCTOR X546
Yeah but.

PATIENT X546
For you I will take it every other day.

DOCTOR X546
Are you going to pick them up?

PATIENT X546
No mail everything.  I got to get to the cashier before 4 o'clock so I have child expenses to pay back home.

DOCTOR X546
Okay.

PATIENT X546
Cause they don't stay open when you got 3 o'clock appointments, they close at 4 sharp.  Is it normal for me to be tired when I wake up in the morning cause by 11 o'clock then I'm ready to go?  You know I have energy.

DOCTOR X546
Are you sleeping okay?

PATIENT X546
Uh I usually have to get up twice during the night to go to the washroom.

DOCTOR X546

DOCTOR X546

PATIENT X546

DOCTOR X546

PATIENT X546
Oh right, I'll go back to taking the aspirin.

DOCTOR X546

DOCTOR X95 
PATIENT?

PATIENT X95
Oh.  Hi.

DOCTOR X95
I'm DOCTOR; I think we met once before.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
It's been a pleasure once before.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Sit right here sir.  Have a seat.  Alright, so how have things been since I last saw you here?

PATIENT X95
Uh, a little rocky.

DOCTOR X95
It was almost a year ago huh.

PATIENT X95
Almost a year ago.

DOCTOR X95
Almost a year ago.  Did you finish your hepatitis C treatment?

PATIENT X95
Yes I finished that and it didn't work.

DOCTOR X95
Oh gosh okay.

PATIENT X95
It didn't take and so uh I had a liver scan done and a liver biopsy and I'm in final stages of cirrhosis and level 3 hepatitis.  So tell me what that means.

DOCTOR X95
Well it basically means that the hepatitis has kind of taken over your liver.  So your normal liver tissue has been replaced by basically scar tissue.  

PATIENT X95
Alright.

DOCTOR X95
So you still must have a little bit of residual function yet cause I see you've had some labs and things that actually show that your liver functions kind of holding.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Which is good um, so basically it just means that you're operating on very little normal liver left.

PATIENT X95
Okay and uh, is that uh is it pushing bile into my body?

DOCTOR X95
Not necessarily yet no.  

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
There are stages of cirrhosis in terms of like stages, I don't necessarily, essentially your liver will stop being able to detoxify the blood and things which is what its primarily responsibility is, it helps to do that, helps manage the lower blood sugars and things like that too.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
But its main goal is to get rid of all the impurities and the bad stuff that basically when eat, drink certain things.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
That's just how our body metabolizes and your liver helps you kind of get rid of some of that stuff.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Eventually as the cirrhoses progresses, even actually in the end stages of cirrhosis um, at some point your body won't be able to get rid of that, the toxins and then they can start building up and start causing side effects.

PATIENT X95
Can you get dialysis and takes @@@?.

DOCTOR X95
Unfortunately no.  Kidneys yes, when your kidneys fail you can but unfortunately we haven't developed a good way, a good substitute liver if you will that can help with detoxifying the body like we've managed to come up with for the kidneys.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
So only curative treatment for end-stage cirrhosis, when it gets to that point um, that's a transplant so.

PATIENT X95
And I can't get transplant cause I can't get rid of the hepatitis.

DOCTOR X95
So.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Although they do sometimes make some exceptions and things in certain circumstances.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
You know with having the hepatitis because hepatitis is the number, actually not number one, one of the top few reasons why people develop cirrhosis.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Of the liver because we know that that particular virus does that.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Um and so it's not an absolute contraindication being able to get a liver although it does put you at a much higher risk.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Because if you have hepatitis, you put in a new liver, the changes are you'll develop hepatitis in that one, but that's not to say that you wouldn't at least you know buy yourself some time in terms of things.

PATIENT X95
I don't want to buy time.

DOCTOR X95
Now, now.  Don't say that now you're a younger guy so.

PATIENT X95
Yeah and what am I gonna do, get old and hurt all the time, stay sick?

DOCTOR X95
Well certainly you know.

PATIENT X95
You know, I'm pretty fortunate.  I can die a young man instead of an old man and I won't have to worry about all those other aches and pains cause I tell you what the pain doesn't get easier the older you get, it gets worse.

DOCTOR X95
True.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Sometimes it's not about the quantity of life per say, it's the quality of life.

PATIENT X95
Right.

DOCTOR X95
If you're quality of life is going to be poor then you know like what's the push for the quantity part.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
But I'd agree with you there, I'd agree with you there.  

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
But so far your liver, in terms of you know its function for the most part its holding.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
You know a lot of people can go many, many years, even in end-stage cirrhosis and still live you know, many many years down the road without having a lot of the problems.

PATIENT X95
Counting back I got this 35 years ago.

DOCTOR X95
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X95
In bootcamp.  I have pictures showing the guns they used, the air guns.

DOCTOR X95
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X95
So what's the max life of hepatitis in your body, 40 years isn't it?

DOCTOR X95
Its @@@ times, @@@ times.  

PATIENT X95
Well what is a life time?

DOCTOR X95
You never ever get rid of it so however long you live the virus can live.

PATIENT X95
But how long before it kills you, 40 years is that the max you can keep it?

DOCTOR X95
Ah.

PATIENT X95
Before it kills you?

DOCTOR X95
Uh I'm thinking a little bit different.  Everybody is different.

PATIENT X95
I need an answer, I need an answer.

DOCTOR X95
I wouldn't be able to, I wouldn't be able to give you one cause some people get hepatitis and you know they're dead within five years some people get it and it never actually kills them.  They die of other things you know, we see old people.

PATIENT X95
I know, I know now though uh I don't have any energy and I can be sitting and all of a sudden I just go totally blank.  I can't do nothing, I can't hardly get up and then a little while later I'm okay and I can get up and I can walk again and.

DOCTOR X95
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X95
But I have these energy spells where I just lose it all.  Is that from the sugar and the diabetes or is that from the hepatitis and the liver because I know the liver causes fatigue.  The hepatitis does.

DOCTOR X95
It can definitely cause fatigue as well as.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Different things in your blood sugar with the diabetes can do that too but also the treatment that you're on for the hepatitis.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
It and of itself, even after you stop treating, in the treatment with it can have some longer lasting side effects, particularly like with those energy.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
You know you feel miserable when you were getting that treatment.

PATIENT X95
Right.

DOCTOR X95
Um.

PATIENT X95
This is a different type of fatigue, I still have that but this fatigue I can be doing something and all of a sudden it just hits me all at once and I can't do nothing.

DOCTOR X95
You kind of have to just sit and let it pass.

PATIENT X95
Yep, yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
That could be related to you know the liver.  It could be related to the sugars too.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
But uh you know you don't have any yellowing of your skin or your eyes.  I can tell you what we worry about you know when you have cirrhosis.

PATIENT X95
I've never turned yellow.

DOCTOR X95
Which is good, which is good.  Um can you go like this for me @@@.  So you don't have a weak sort of a flap that people develop when the toxins are building up in their body.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
And so you go to do this and you're not able to actually keep your hands up, they just keep falling.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Too.

PATIENT X95
Huh.

DOCTOR X95
Yeah no that's actually good so.  I think for the most part @@@ hold them which is a good thing, uh-huh it's a good thing so.  I think you've still got a few years left.  Even if you're in the end stages in terms of you know the liver itself meaning that there's not much good tissue left.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Um, what good tissue you have its still working.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
The liver can be you know a pretty remarkable organ in that it can hang on for quite some time even when a lot of it is uh.

PATIENT X95
I've been taking care of myself for a long time too and that might have a lot to do with it.

DOCTOR X95
Definitely can, definitely can sure.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.  How will I know whenever my liver's getting worse?

DOCTOR X95
Blood tests that we check periodically, at least twice a year and then looking for signs of um liver dysfunction so like I said like if you suddenly notice it.  Most people won't necessarily notice this but um, particularly yellowing of the eyes, yellowing of the skin uh things like that.  Those are the signs of the liver signs of the liver starting to not work as well as it should.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh and what.

DOCTOR X95
That'll be the number thing you'd look for.

PATIENT X95
What about my kidneys um with the diabetes uh.  Will I know whenever my kidneys are getting ready to shut down, is there any signs?

DOCTOR X95
You probably won't but we'll notice if your kidneys are starting to worsen because that's something else that's a part of the routine follow-up when we manage the diabetes, we check your kidney function as well and then we keep an eye on it because we do know that diabetes over time, one of the number one reasons a lot of people end up on dialysis is because their kidneys fail.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Um but by keeping a close eye on it and managing things when we see it in terms of keeping your sugars controlled and keeping blood pressure controlled, keeping things like that, all the things kind of keep your kidneys as healthy as we can.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
While we're dealing with the diabetes, that's the best way we can to try and prevent that from ultimately happening for sure.

PATIENT X95
And another thing uh my eye doctor said I have glaucoma and she said it wasn't that bad so I don't have to worry about it.  Is there any such thing as not worrying about glaucoma?

DOCTOR X95
There is.

PATIENT X95
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X95
Yes with your health there is.  So you know, there are different types of glaucoma.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
First and foremost but the most common type most people we just need to monitor it as well as because you have diabetes, you need to make sure you're seeing an eye doctor at least once a year.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
And so when you have the findings of glaucoma, they just need to monitor the pressures in the eye over a period of time.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
And if they start to get to a level where it's getting high, too high, then we start the different drops and medications that we start to use but initially.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
It's good to know that you have it so that we know that we need to monitor the eye pressures and to monitor the glaucoma development at the time.

PATIENT X95
Yeah my eyes have been really dry lately and I got some drops one time and I got this just a little bitty bottle and you gave me a prescription but I've run out of it, can you get.

DOCTOR X95
We can get refills.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
Yeah, yeah basically it's just this artificial tears.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
But they work really really well.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Um you know we can order those for you.

PATIENT X95
Yeah my eyes were.


DOCTOR X95
Not a problem at all.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
Now as far as you're other medicines that you're taking, taking a baby aspirin every day?

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Good uh and then your insulin regimen.  How much of the Glargine are you using now?

PATIENT X95
I'm using uh 25 units now.

DOCTOR X95
25 now and how have your sugars been doing at home?

PATIENT X95
It's been running 115-120.

DOCTOR X95
Good, good, very good, very good.  Um still taking the metformin twice a day?

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Good.

PATIENT X95
I'm taking a half a pill.  I'm taking 500 mg now.

DOCTOR X95
Okay.  But still taking it twice a day right?

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Okay good and then the insulin you said you're doing 25 units now.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
And then are you still taking the acid reflux medicine, the omeprazole?  Not taking that one anymore.

PATIENT X95
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X95
And then are you still using the Xanax three times a day or not using that either?

PATIENT X95
No I'm not using that either.

DOCTOR X95
Okay.  So basically the aspirin, the insulin, the metformin and you have the nitroglycerin tablets in case you need them.

PATIENT X95
That's it, just in case.

DOCTOR X95
Okay.  I saw that you had couple of bouts of the chest pain but everything turned out okay because the stress test and everything looked good.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Which is good.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
You do have the nitroglycerin just in case?

PATIENT X95
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Okay.  Have you had to use any more of it?

PATIENT X95
Uh one time.

DOCTOR X95
One time.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
So just the one time.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
And did it help when you used it?

PATIENT X95
Yeah, yeah it did.  I took it right away.

DOCTOR X95
Good, good.  Alright.  And are you still seeing any of the doctors on the outside or you primarily come through the VA?

PATIENT X95
I'm going to come to the VA mainly.

DOCTOR X95
Now that you've finished the hepatitis therapy and everything.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh, right.

DOCTOR X95
Okay.  You had some problem with mental health as well.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
You been trying to stay clean and sober?

PATIENT X95
Yeah I'm trying to keep my head right you know.

DOCTOR X95
Good, good, cause you gotta do that, you gotta do that in order to take care of yourself.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Gotta be healthy up here to be healthy everywhere else.

PATIENT X95
Exactly.

DOCTOR X95
Good, good.

PATIENT X95
And tell me something uh three doctors have told me that you can get these uh marijuana pills that's got the same thing in it as marijuana does and I was wondering if you can give me that because the marijuana actually kills the pain in my body and I was smoking when I was on the treatment and it took off the edge of the treatment and I, my bones didn't hurt as much.  It took away the nausea and the vomiting and stuff like that.

DOCTOR X95
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X95
And uh then when I went back to work they're saying no you can't do that you know and uh they had a big stink about it and uh I'm not working now though but uh, um, I told some other doctors and they're saying you know you can get pills for that that have the same thing in it and it'd do the same thing for you and you don't have to smoke marijuana.

DOCTOR X95
Uh-huh.  I admit I'm not familiar with it here.  Now there is a similar compound that uh we use for appetite stimulation but they don't have any for like sedatives or like pain relieving effect that are made from a marijuana @@@ compound.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Uh but I don't know, it doesn't sound like that would be the type of pill because they said it's mainly, so we use it like in cancer patients.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
For example when they have very very poor appetites and we need to stimulate their.

PATIENT X95
Yeah that's what I, I was going three days without eating at the time and I couldn't remember to eat and so uh.

DOCTOR X95
But if I remember correctly they're restricted medications so our Oncology Department.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
That's not something that we just have here unfortunately.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Illinois has not jumped on the bandwagon for like I said medical marijuana use.

PATIENT X95
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X95
Some other states yes.  Unfortunately Illinois has not and neither have the VA's here either.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
So I apologize I would not be able to do that.

PATIENT X95
I would a lot rather have something like that rather than Xanax and.

DOCTOR X95
Sure, sure, no I mean that's understandable.

PATIENT X95
Those kind of things.

DOCTOR X95
Now I don't know if you know the Mental Health Department if there's something that maybe they could offer you that might be similar uh, they may have options that aren't available to me as a, you know an internal medicine physician.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
So it might be worth asking about that, especially if it's like in terms of like helping to manage the mood and like if you're overwhelmed.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
It might be worth asking them.

PATIENT X95
It takes away the anxiety.

DOCTOR X95
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X95
It takes away the anxiety and uh it takes away a lot of the pain in my spine and my hip and knee.

DOCTOR X95
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X95
And.

DOCTOR X95
It might be worth it, worth asking about.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
You follow up with them already you know, it might not be a bad idea just to say hey is there anything other than you know resorting to actually you know smoking marijuana that you know I can maybe use to kind of help me manage these things.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Unfortunately um the substances, the pill that I'm familiar with.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Is solely an appetite stimulant that's uses.

PATIENT X95
Appetite stimulant uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Used as a force that was actually in the marijuana but obviously gives you the munchies you that sort of thing.

PATIENT X95
Yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
So that whole part of things but without any of the @@@ you know sedating or anxiety or any of the side effects that actually marijuana does.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.  Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
And it helps your food for sure.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
The Oncology Department @@@ chemotherapy would treat you for something like that.

PATIENT X95
Right.

DOCTOR X95
They do treatment like that so.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Oncology would be able the help you out there.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
But Mental Health Department might be able to because they definitely have different medications up their sleeve and might be more familiar with some of these alternatives too.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
But they may actually be able to help.

PATIENT X95
I'll tell you what, start mixing pain pills and Xanax.

DOCTOR X95
That's not a good combination sometimes.

PATIENT X95
Yeah your head just you know.

DOCTOR X95
Yeah.

PATIENT X95
It don't work right.

DOCTOR X95
No @@@ either.

PATIENT X95
They gave me those uh depression pills and they're saying these are the weakest ones we got.  I said I have bad side effects on this stuff and sure enough they gave me the weakest one and.

DOCTOR X95
And you still have the worst side effects with them.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.  I have real bad side effects and I took them.

DOCTOR X95
Yeah.

PATIENT X95
Two times.

DOCTOR X95
You're that sensitive to things.  

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
It just does, it makes it hard to find options that work for you.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Sure.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Well come have a seat up here, let me take a listen here to your hearts and lungs and everything.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
Deep breaths in and out.  It's nice and clear.  I'll take a listen here to your heart and just breathe normal.  You get a lot of swelling in your legs or anything like that?

PATIENT X95
Yeah I'm retaining water right now but.

DOCTOR X95
Retaining a little bit.

PATIENT X95
Yeah but I think it's because I haven't been working.  I had to quit work because I just couldn't do the job anymore.

DOCTOR X95
Yeah, everything's kind of taking its toll.

PATIENT X95
Yeah, yeah and I have a required mandatory 48 hour week and six days a week and.

DOCTOR X95
Oh gosh.

PATIENT X95
I told them, I gotta have two days to recover you know I can't do it in one day.

DOCTOR X95
No I hear you.  If I had to do that indefinite no.  I mean our hours are kind of crazy while we're training but.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Goodness gracious, if I had to do that for.

PATIENT X95
This guy has been working there 45 years, one day off a week all their life.

DOCTOR X95
I mean great for them, they're working, if that's the way they want to live.  I don't think I could do it either.

PATIENT X95
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X95
So.

PATIENT X95
Yeah I did it for over six years and.

DOCTOR X95
Okay.

PATIENT X95
And now that I got sick.

DOCTOR X95
Time to throw in the towel and focus on other things.

PATIENT X95
Yeah it is.

DOCTOR X95
Hopefully, let me take a quick peek here.  I think everything else @@@, pull up.  So you think we'll hold off until next time you come we'll check your labs again.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
And at that point we'll check and get an idea what the level of your hepatitis virus and everything too.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
Um check your liver function tests, make sure everything's still holding the same.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Um so in the meantime we'll keep going with the same medicines that you're taking.  There's @@@ with diabetes and everything so you don't take, take a quick peek.

PATIENT X95
Yeah.

DOCTOR X95
Okay, yeah it was last year when we checked your diabetes number it was perfect it's 5.7.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
We want below 7 so that's great.  So we'll check that again next time you come in alright.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
And then otherwise I think you need to come back in about six months or so and we'll check some blood tests, check your diabetes, check your liver, check your hepatitis status and all that stuff.

PATIENT X95
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
And we'll go from there but I'll make sure you've got plenty of refills that will get you through until then.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
If you start to run low on something and you're running low just call our clinic here and you can leave a message and we can call in the refill for you.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95
Alright.  So I would check with Mental Health @@@.  Medical marijuana alternative that might work for you.

PATIENT X95
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X95
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X95
Okay.

DOCTOR X95

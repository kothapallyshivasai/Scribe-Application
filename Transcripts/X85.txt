DOCTOR X85
PATIENT?  Hello.

PATIENT X85
How you doing?

DOCTOR X85
Good.  How you doing?

PATIENT X85
Good.  Good as can be.

DOCTOR X85
So it uh seems you've had some action.

PATIENT X85
Oh yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Recently huh.

PATIENT X85
Yeah I had the stones busted up.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah.

PATIENT X85
I must of had them a long time and just never knew it.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah usually you'll have them until they get to a certain size then they you know of course cause you pain.

PATIENT X85
It comes to note the pain.  Well the last couple of months, around I don't know how long but uh I would get blood in my urine once in a while, then it'd go away so I didn't pay any attention to it you know and then I went on a trip and I felt real weak and I was having back pains you know and I thought I must have sprained my back or did something you know and then when I got home it really hurt and the rest is history.  I'm still having the problem.  You know @@@ I still get this burning sensation now I don't know if it's from the stent that's still in there or what and uh I still got this prostate thing driving me nuts.  I have no time to get to the bathroom you know.

DOCTOR X85
You just keep going, going, going?

PATIENT X85
No it's not that, it's when I got to go, I got to go, like I got 15 seconds to find a can somewhere, otherwise I'm wetting in my pants you know and uh that's starting to be real irritable.  I take those pills, the terazosin.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
Or whatever they are and it's usually good enough to @@@ while but and then I'll stop into a friend of mines.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
He was in the Marine Corps and uh he just found out he's got prostate cancer.  He had a removal.

DOCTOR X85
Right.

PATIENT X85
He had it so bad.

DOCTOR X85
Well it doesn't look like you're on anything for your prostate.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.  Terazosin.

DOCTOR X85
The terazosin?

PATIENT X85
Terazosin yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Okay, yeah @@@.  There's another one we can use that actually treats the prostate.

PATIENT X85
@@@.

DOCTOR X85
As far as prostate cancer goes um we've been checking your PSA.

PATIENT X85
Well he told me his PSA was always good and then I don't know what the problem was, it developed into you know a little more and he had cancer throughout his entire prostate and he had it removed, got to take it out you know so I thought the PSA test was.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah, it's rapid.  Even if it's low enough it increases by, if it doubles.

PATIENT X85
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X85
It's supposed to be normal, let's say it was 1 and then it goes up to 2 then uh you know you get alarmed about it but yours has always been 0.76, you know maybe 0.87 so we're not concerned.

PATIENT X85
No he did tell me that, he was at 1. something then it shot up to 3.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah even when it's normal it's still a big increase that we'd be concerned.

PATIENT X85
Yeah okay good then I don't have to worry about that.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah and we'll check it again this year.

PATIENT X85
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Um.

PATIENT X85
But uh my uh my big thing is that it's just holding my urine back you know till I get to the bathroom.  Uh sometimes when I do go I've got a very weak flow you know.  Some point @@@ I'm gonna get a pain you know.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
Cause I got to go so bad and I'll wet the pants then.  It's starting to get my @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Did they initially put a catheter in there?

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Is that out now?

PATIENT X85
Yeah that was out.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
The catheter was only in there for one day.

DOCTOR X85
For one day okay.

PATIENT X85
And now when I go to the bathroom @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah, @@@.

PATIENT X85
I had @@@ from before but this one was @@@.  I felt bad for the nurse I started pissing all over the place you know.

DOCTOR X85
How's your sugar doing?

PATIENT X85
Actually I'm gonna tell you, @@@ since I had this kidney stone removal.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
My sugar has dropped down quite a bit.

DOCTOR X85
You check it like in the morning?

PATIENT X85
I check it in the morning and the evening.

DOCTOR X85
What is it usually in the morning?

PATIENT X85
The mornings are a little bit on the high side around 180.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
But the last couple of weeks, since I've had @@@ the evenings are from anywhere from 70-130 which is pretty good for me.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah, sounds like its pretty.  Sounds better.

PATIENT X85
Oh yeah, you know especially in the evening before I go to bed I check it I'm in the 120 you know.  Usually in the range of 100-120.  Every so often I'll be at 70 or 80 but, it's a lot better than it was you know months ago.

DOCTOR X85
Good.  Well we checked that test to see where it stands, that hemoglobin A1c.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
@@@ tests that you got @@@.

PATIENT X85
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X85
It's down in the, yeah we want less than 7; you got 8.5 the last time.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
You know so this is new here.  When I got to you it was 10.7.  You've got it down to 6.7 which is under 7 but then @@@ know what happened and it's coming back up so hopefully now we can get it, get it controlled.

PATIENT X85
Well I already had a bypass surgery.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah.

PATIENT X85
See I've been having a lot of stress like for a while you know.  Basically mainly this year.

DOCTOR X85
Is your daughter living with you?

PATIENT X85
No.  She's moved out.  She got her own place now.

DOCTOR X85
Well.

PATIENT X85
She had lost her job and everything was going bad for her then things started going bad for me you know cause now I got put up with three little kids running around and I mean stuff like that I have no place to hide you know.  Then with the kidney stones you know I have more stress and pain and I think that's my sugar is jumping all over the place.  @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Um I'm going ask you a question, @@@.  Um.

PATIENT X85
It depends what it is.  @@@.

DOCTOR X85
You need to be truthful with me, you know @@@.  I've @@@ or anything but uh you uh you had a urine test.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
In February.

PATIENT X85
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X85
It tested positive for cocaine.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Can you tell me anything about it?  @@@.

PATIENT X85
Yeah, once in a while I do it you know.  I don't do it a lot, I get together with a couple of guys and you know have a beer or two.

DOCTOR X85
Do you smoke it or snort it?

PATIENT X85
No no I snort it, if I do it at all.  It's just, it don't bother me and once in a while I just do it you know.

DOCTOR X85
The thing is that it tested positive for marijuana too, that's, more of the cocaine stuff.  Was the cocaine just because you do have the heart you know issues, you know with that past surgery stuff.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Cause a lot of guys, @@@ get a heart attack from the cocaine.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
So I don't want you to @@@ I prefer that you know.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
You really want to uh you know.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
That's whatever but the cocaine I would try not to.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Cause I don't want you showing up with a heart attack.  If you weren't you know, you have the heart issues to begin with and you're diabetic and.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
It's not the best you know thing for you.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
To probably, you know you can probably get a lot of damage.

PATIENT X85
You know I had been using, I would take it, I just happened to do it that week you know.

DOCTOR X85
Well I appreciate you being honest with me.

PATIENT X85
@@@.  I'm 64 years old.

DOCTOR X85
Right.

PATIENT X85
My lying days are over.  I don't know how much longer I have.  I have a lot of problems with everything you know.  I got a problem with life, until I found out my problem @@@. 

DOCTOR X85
Otherwise your mood is okay, everything is good?

PATIENT X85
Yeah for the most part.  For the most part yeah, especially lately I just was feeling real good you know.

DOCTOR X85
Good.  And uh how much Lantus are you taking now, your insulin?

PATIENT X85
Lantus uh I'm taking like every evening around 25 units.

DOCTOR X85
Okay. 

PATIENT X85
And I'm thinking the way I'm going.

DOCTOR X85
Do you still have some of it?

PATIENT X85
Oh yeah, yeah.  I have one more bottle of it.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.  It looks like somehow they got you up to 30 units, @@@.  Well good okay.  Otherwise did you take your blood pressure pills this morning?

PATIENT X85
No, I forgot all my medications.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
I was driving halfway here and I had it on the countertop so I wouldn't forget it and I just forgot it.  Normally I take it around 7 a.m. or so.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah your blood pressure.

PATIENT X85
It was a little high yeah.

DOCTOR X85
A little high.  

PATIENT X85
But usually once I take my meds.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
And I check my blood pressure and I'm right on the money.

DOCTOR X85
You're on the money.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
Like I said the sugars at the end of the day, before I go to bed I check it and uh the last couple of weeks I've been laid up since the day I had the stones @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
Uh I came in and my sugar was like 300.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
Yeah it was real high.  But after they did the stones, I dropped down to 114.

DOCTOR X85
Good.

PATIENT X85
And they couldn't figure out and neither could I you know.  Like maybe @@@ sugar off you know.

DOCTOR X85
You know any stress on the body like you said.

PATIENT X85
Well that's you know, I've been like I said, the last couple of months I've been under a lot of stress and it's been causing a little havoc @@@.  @@@ sleep apnea, you know @@@ to that.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
I turned that thing in, I just cannot use it.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
All it does it uh I wake up about two hours after using it and my mouth is so dry it feels like my throat is sticking shut and @@@ and I've had apnea a long time @@@ to get a full night's sleep out of it you know.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
So I just kind of brought it back and told them look I can't use this thing.  You know. 

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
He says well you got to try it for a while.  I said I've had two years or so.

DOCTOR X85
You don't feel like it's worked for you at all?  Have you talked to the breathing people upstairs?

PATIENT X85
Uh I think I talked to them once about it and they said well you got do @@@ this and that.  Oh yeah then I was supposed see DOCTOR, you know how it is, @@@.  Yeah.  I don't know but the last time I went to see her I really got pissed off.  I got there; I had a 3:30 appointment, so I get there a little early.  I sat there and I'm watching everybody get up and get seen and it's like almost 5 o'clock.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
And there's me and another guy that walked in about 45 minutes you know after me and she calls him and tells me I'm next.  I looked at my watch and I said I'm next, its 5 o'clock already.  I just got pissed off and got up and left you know.

DOCTOR X85
Hmm.

PATIENT X85
I couldn't stand sitting there no more.  I mean I know doctors are busy and they're gonna be late but for Christ's sake I was sitting there for almost two hours and some guy walks in later than me and she takes her in.

DOCTOR X85
@@@.

PATIENT X85
What am I chopped liver?  So I just got up and left and I haven't nothing else.  All I ever do with her is I'm in and out of her office ten minutes but @@@.  She could have called me up and told me that.

DOCTOR X85
True.

PATIENT X85
But otherwise you know suddenly.  @@@ prostate that's you know, I've been having trouble with it for quite a while now.  It's definitely getting to the point where I got to watch when I go out and how long it takes you know.  Then I got to carry a big milk bottle around in case I got to pee, I just pull over cause I just can't hold it.

DOCTOR X85
Well what about the finasteride.

PATIENT X85
Huh?

DOCTOR X85
You're on another medication.

PATIENT X85
@@@.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah, yeah.  It's supposed to help shrink your prostate.

PATIENT X85
Yeah cause it's just terrible and like I said the flow in the morning is really @@@.  It's like @@@.  But on April 2nd I got to come back for my, for the kidney stones and they're gonna check them out.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
See there was one more big one or one more lodged in my kidney and I guess they couldn't keep on blasting them because the kidney only takes so much but I was checking my urine with the screen and I don't know if passed, the whole passed or not.  I have to get those chunks cleared away.  Boy did that hurt, @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Do you feel like @@@.

PATIENT X85
@@@.  I hang on to the wall and I looked in the mirror while I'm making these animal faces from the pain you know but the pain has subsided a lot.  You know I still have a little bit of burning sensation and I can handle it but I @@@ with the catheter or what you know.

DOCTOR X85
Have you had an eye exam recently?

PATIENT X85
No I'm about due for that.  Yeah it's been over a year now @@@.

DOCTOR X85
And did they any pictures of your eyes or @@@ seeing a doctor, do you remember?

PATIENT X85
Uh the last time they gave me an eye exam @@@ ask him about the one eye.  See what happened with my eyes, I had cataracts.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
One doctor worked on my one eye, he was an Oriental doctor, the guy was great.  I mean he got done and I almost had 20/20 vision and I was supposed to get the same thing in the other eye but with the other eye I had another doctor, but the day of surgery he wasn't in so some other guy took over and @@@ he poked my eyeball out.  Cause I got nothing but trouble with it and one @@@ after another.

DOCTOR X85
Right.

PATIENT X85
Then finding another doctor, reset the lens a little bit and uh that helped a little bit with the little floaters I was seeing but yeah it's still not right, the lens and I guess they tell me there's nothing they can do so.  But I can still see @@@ but my right eye is useless.  Just a bad @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah.

PATIENT X85
And between you and me I'd like to hit that other guy.  Put my finger in his eye.

DOCTOR X85
I think you're due for a colonoscopy too.  @@@.  You had one in 2005.

PATIENT X85
Was it really that long ago?

DOCTOR X85
Yeah.  Five years ago and you had small polyps it said.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
And there's one of those polyps that you don't expect but it was small so.

PATIENT X85
Well I know they removed it.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah they removed it but uh, I think we need to get it done again.

PATIENT X85
Okay.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
That's always a lot of fun.

DOCTOR X85
You like that don't you?

PATIENT X85
Oh yeah I love it.  @@@ another guy was sitting there @@@ and @@@ finally one day I said hey what kind of work you do.  @@@ I'm a lawyer and @@@ no kidding.  Wow that's interesting, let me tell you what I am and he goes @@@.  So what kind of job you doing?  The guy goes no I'm a musician and the other guy goes what, a musician.  He says @@@ since I was a kid.  @@@ well it's kind of hard @@@ and the lawyer being a lawyer says oh yeah, he says if you were a real musician you would @@@ he says no bend over, so I bend over and he says now can you feel my thumb in your ass and the lawyer goes yeah and he goes da da.

DOCTOR X85
I've never heard that one.  @@@.  If you don't mind stepping up here.  I like your shoes are they new?

PATIENT X85
You know I buy these at a wholesale place called xxx; I got them out of the VFW Magazine.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
These were $29 bucks.

DOCTOR X85
They look pretty good.

PATIENT X85
Yeah and they've got pants.  They've got clothes half of what I was paying for all the time.

DOCTOR X85
@@@.

PATIENT X85
I mean like these pants.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
You know knock arounds.  They were cheap, I bought a couple pair of these and then the shoes, they're all like Dr. Scholls, @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Comfortable?

PATIENT X85
Yeah comfortable.  In fact I get more comfort out of these than I do when I go to the shoe store.  It seems like everything in the shoe store is @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Yeah it doesn't. It takes a while to get used to it.

PATIENT X85
Like a Chinese lawyer.

DOCTOR X85
Say @@@.  Take a deep breath.  Let it out, again.  Again and again.  Have you @@@.

PATIENT X85
You like what I was going to tell you.

DOCTOR X85

PATIENT X85
It seems like I'm having a lot of trouble with my @@@.  Like if I sit a while.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
And when I get up and try to walk.

DOCTOR X85
@@@.

PATIENT X85
No just achy, real painful like you know.  But I know when I was in the military I got hit in the back and uh it's nothing that really bothered me a whole helluva lot but I can tell, I'd say the last couple of years, one or two years, once I got a job @@@ why it's like I get up and just getting up it feels like I'm really straining though.

DOCTOR X85
Where does it hurt?  You don't feel this?

PATIENT X85
No in the side.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
On this one side it hurts @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Right.  And you don't have any numbness or tingling?

PATIENT X85
No.  It feels like a @@@ and I do exercises and stuff.  Once I start moving around its fine.

DOCTOR X85
Are you still employed?

PATIENT X85
I haven't been because of the kidney thing.

DOCTOR X85
Right.

PATIENT X85
I @@@. 

DOCTOR X85
Any blood in your stool or @@@?

PATIENT X85
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X85
Can I have you take your shoes and socks off so I can check your feet?

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
You keep good care of your feet?

PATIENT X85
Yeah I uh, you know I @@@.  My wife bought me special @@@ for diabetics.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
You know for the feet.

DOCTOR X85
Right.

PATIENT X85
So I use that.

DOCTOR X85
I'm gonna do this test where it's going to feel kind of funny.  You tell me when you feel it okay.

PATIENT X85
Okay.

DOCTOR X85
You say yes.  

PATIENT X85
Yeah I felt it it's like a bump.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
@@@.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Okay.  Tell me whenever you feel it.

PATIENT X85
Yeah, yeah uh I can feel it a little bit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Okay good.  You haven't lost any of your, @@@ nerve problems from your diabetes.

PATIENT X85
Yeah.

DOCTOR X85
Any circulation problems in your feet that uh.

PATIENT X85
I do notice though on occasions uh my feet get a little sweaty.

DOCTOR X85
Sweaty?

PATIENT X85
A little sweaty.

DOCTOR X85
Let me give you a hand there.

PATIENT X85
Either sweaty or real cold.

DOCTOR X85
You can put your shoes and socks back on.  I want to talk about your case with @@@ doctor.

PATIENT X85
Okay.

DOCTOR X85
Um otherwise did they tell you what kind of stones they were?

PATIENT X85
No.  Well I don't think they uh, I don't know.  I have no idea what kind of stones they were.

DOCTOR X85
It was a uric acid stone.

PATIENT X85
What does that mean?

DOCTOR X85
Um well it uh, it's uric acid stones.  Uric acid, you've never had gout before?

PATIENT X85
No.

DOCTOR X85
No.  It happens when you have uh a high level of uric acid in your blood.  When you have high uric acid sometimes you can get gout, sometimes you can get stones.  You haven't had gout before.

PATIENT X85
No.

DOCTOR X85
But it's pretty painful.

PATIENT X85
@@@.

DOCTOR X85
In your big toe and stuff uh so we can think about putting you on a pill that decreases that level and this is not the first time you've had stones is it?

PATIENT X85
Well actually yeah this is the first time I ever got treated for them.

DOCTOR X85
Treated for them but you've had them for a long time.

PATIENT X85
I was just amazed, uh surmising I guess you know.  I really don't know.  I always get pain in the back for years but I always thought you know I worked construction and I worked pretty hard my whole life

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
I just figured I twisted a muscle or something you know and I never thought about stones at all.

DOCTOR X85
Stones are.

PATIENT X85
Cause my wife had them and the pain she was going through was something else and I didn't have that pain.  Like I said a couple of times I'd say the last few I've had blood in my urine.  I mean not real heavy.

DOCTOR X85
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X85
You know I noticed the color had changed.

DOCTOR X85
Right.

PATIENT X85
But that kind of cleared up so I never paid attention to it.  As far as the real serious pain I didn't have up until January and then I didn't know what it was.

DOCTOR X85
Well I'll be back okay.

PATIENT X85
Okay.  I'll be fine, talking to myself.

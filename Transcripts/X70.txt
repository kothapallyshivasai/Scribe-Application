DOCTOR X70
To the Lab?

PATIENT X70
Oh to the Lab no.

DOCTOR X70
Okay so I'll have you stop by the Lab on your way out so you don't have to make an extra trip.

DOCTOR X70
Yeah I'm saying so you don't have to make an extra trip since you've done that a lot.

PATIENT X70
Yeah.

DOCTOR X70
Are you fasting today?

PATIENT X70
No.

DOCTOR X70
You're not okay.  Um you know it helps when you come to the VA to be fasting cause usually we check your cholesterol and that way you don't have to make an extra trip while you're fasting okay.

PATIENT X70
How many @@@ cholesterol @@@.

DOCTOR X70
Less than two.

PATIENT X70
@@@.

DOCTOR X70
@@@ uh-huh.  @@@.

PATIENT X70
Alright @@@ so one of them @@@.

DOCTOR X70
We could probably do that, if you wanted to fast next time and come and then we can just check one lab today, the diabetes lab, the A1c.  You don't have to be fasting for that so we'll check that today and then the other one can be checked when you come.

PATIENT X70
Sounds good.

DOCTOR X70
Okay.  @@@.  So the diabetes lab we'll check today okay?

PATIENT X70
Yeah that's fine.

DOCTOR X70
Okay.  

PATIENT X70
They're billing Blue Cross/Blue Shield and they're trying to collect $440 from me.

DOCTOR X70
From you?

PATIENT X70
From Blue Cross/Blue Shield.

DOCTOR X70
Oh really.

PATIENT X70
They told me to @@@.

DOCTOR X70
Huh.  Well how's everything else been?

PATIENT X70
(Laughs).

DOCTOR X70
@@@.  And then I'll order that shingles vaccine for you.

PATIENT X70
Most of the time they'll send me a letter saying you're due @@@ two weeks from now @@@.

DOCTOR X70
@@@ at the time of the next visit with DOCTOR.

PATIENT X70
Great.  @@@.  Now if I get in trouble with this medicine should I call you?  Who do I call?

DOCTOR X70
Um you know I don't know how much I'll be able to do because of the rules and their limitations.

PATIENT X70
Okay.

DOCTOR X70
So for a few days if you're running low you may have to take your glipizide just twice a day @@@ okay.  I'm sorry about that.

PATIENT X70
@@@.

DOCTOR X70
@@@ talk about?

PATIENT X70
Yeah I'm getting some trouble with my joints.

DOCTOR X70
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X70
@@@ straight.

DOCTOR X70
Is @@@ in your hands or?

PATIENT X70
In my hands.

DOCTOR X70
Just in your hands okay.  @@@ which thumb?

PATIENT X70
Mainly this one.

DOCTOR X70
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X70
And this one.

DOCTOR X70
And this one.

PATIENT X70
But uh.

DOCTOR X70
Does that hurt when I do this?

PATIENT X70
No but it's @@@.

DOCTOR X70
@@@ when I go like this, squeeze my hand, squeeze my hand okay good.  @@@ and you said they feel stiff?

PATIENT X70
Yes.

DOCTOR X70
Okay.  When do they feel stiff, when you're actually use them?

PATIENT X70
No, @@@ just if I @@@.

DOCTOR X70
Okay.

PATIENT X70
@@@.

DOCTOR X70
Have you okay, so it doesn't look like you have sort of inflammation changes, inflammatory arthritis so you probably have an osteoarthritis at this point, @@@ generations.  Um have you tried Tylenol or anything for the pain?

PATIENT X70
I tried @@@.

DOCTOR X70
Okay well, it's the anti-inflammatory medicines called ibuprofen, Aleve, Motrin those are the medicines they don't want you to take, those are bad for your stomach.  Tylenol is okay with the stomach but it's bad for the liver.  They don't want you to take large amounts of Tylenol but if you need to take an occasional Tylenol or a Tylenol once a day that's okay.  Tylenol Arthritis, if you did take one or two Tylenol that's not gonna be a big deal.  It's not going to affect your liver.

PATIENT X70
@@@.

DOCTOR X70
You don't have liver disease so.

PATIENT X70
That would help @@@.

DOCTOR X70
It'll help with the pain uh-huh and it may help to some degree with the stiffness.  The anti-inflammatories will help more of the stiffness but I don't want you to take those cause those are bad for your stomach and bad for the kidneys so Tylenol @@@ if you need it okay.  Does that sound alright to you?

PATIENT X70
That sounds good.

DOCTOR X70
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X70
I thought maybe you had a magic pill or something.

DOCTOR X70
No, unfortunately I don't.

PATIENT X70
Okay.

DOCTOR X70
Okay so let me show you when you need to go for your shot.

PATIENT X70
Yes.  (Patient and doctor are walking someplace)

DOCTOR X70
@@@.  You can take a seat here and they'll come and get you for your shot.

PATIENT X70
Okay.  So @@@.

DOCTOR X70
Yeah.  @@@.  Take care.

PATIENT X70
You too.

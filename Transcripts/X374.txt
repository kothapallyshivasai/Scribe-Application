DOCTOR X374
PATIENT? 

PATIENT X374
Hi doc, how you doing?

DOCTOR X374
Actually @@@ right?

PATIENT X374
Well I think it's a little more than that doc.  I @@@ that'll help.

DOCTOR X374
Isn't that why you called?

PATIENT X374
Yeah the ankle and from here to the ankle.

DOCTOR X374
Okay, let's take off the shoes and look at both of them.  Tell me what happened.

PATIENT X374
I don't know.  Uh you know they get and the swelling in these ankles and in the ankle for a while but I'll ice it and it'll go down.  I injured it in the military and it never really healed.  When I was in the Army I had a cast on it.

DOCTOR X374
I understand this has been going on since 1998 or something?

PATIENT X374
Uh.

DOCTOR X374
So what's the deal here?

PATIENT X374
You know it was off and on.  If I twisted it or something usually but since the last couple of months.

DOCTOR X374
Alright so the last couple of months.

PATIENT X374
Well it's more and not going down.

DOCTOR X374
Last couple months having more swelling.  And pain or just swelling?

PATIENT X374
Well it was just swelling there, for the past three weeks.

DOCTOR X374
@@@, last three weeks.

PATIENT X374
And a coloration change.

DOCTOR X374
In the last three weeks with a color change and some pain.

PATIENT X374
No, not some pain, it's a sharp like pin sticking pain.

DOCTOR X374
Oh oh.  You got diabetes?

PATIENT X374
Yeah diabetes.

DOCTOR X374
Like needles?

PATIENT X374
Yeah.

DOCTOR X374
Worse at night?

PATIENT X374
It's also worse throughout the day and I'm having numbness too in the area.

DOCTOR X374
Since I'm not your doctor so I don't know your background but it could be that your diabetes is getting worse.

PATIENT X374
Yeah much worse.

DOCTOR X374
And you're having so alright.  So you got some nerves right.  This is your leg right.  You have arteries and you have nerves right.  These are the nerves.  What do you think the nerves do right?

PATIENT X374
Probably sensation yeah.

DOCTOR X374
Sensation that's one.

PATIENT X374
@@@.

DOCTOR X374
One is moving them right.

PATIENT X374
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X374
And some of the nerves go up to the artery alright.  So there's nerves going everywhere right.  So with the diabetes your circulation isn't great.

PATIENT X374
Right.

DOCTOR X374
Alright.  The less controlled you are the blood it's not @@@ very well.  That's why they want you to check your blood pressure.  That's why they want that.  You don't have that, you're gonna have disease.  What's gonna happen, you're gonna have venous stasis, this chronic lower extremity edema and that's in relation like if somebody's not controlling themselves they're going to have ugly looking feet right.

PATIENT X374
Right.

DOCTOR X374
You know when it gets all red and scaly.

PATIENT X374
Uh-huh.  @@@.

DOCTOR X374
And then there's more that do control themselves, they don't get that so.  Every time I show this @@@ control that kind of thing.  The nerves they need to nutrition.  It's just like how your muscles need nutrition to move so if your nerves have poor circulation to them they start getting damage and that's where the pins and needles and numbness, so they're getting damaged.  Why because the circulation is bad.  Why is the circulation bad, because of the diabetes @@@.  Some of it is irreversible.  Once we get to that point there is no more going back, so you just damaged it you know.  So the only hope is try to prevent it from getting worse and try to control your sugars.  So let me see how your sugars have been.

PATIENT X374
Yeah.

DOCTOR X374
Like I say I'm not your doctor so I have no idea of your history so on June 8th you were 8% which is not good.  Do you know what your A1c is?

PATIENT X374
I only know it was done at @@@ where they did a health fair and it was 7.4.

DOCTOR X374
And that was when?

PATIENT X374
That was one month ago, July they had that.

DOCTOR X374
They did a spot check?

PATIENT X374
No they took blood.  They took blood, sent it to a lab and sent me the results back within about two weeks.

DOCTOR X374
So 7.5.  So you've been averaging about 159 fasting glucose for the last three months.

PATIENT X374
Usually they're 162.

DOCTOR X374
So then with an 8 on June 15th you were averaging like 180 fasting.  So it's not very well controlled.

PATIENT X374
But I haven't been able to exercise cause @@@.  I used to just ride a bike @@@.

DOCTOR X374
Have you been taking your insulin?

PATIENT X374
I been taking insulin.

DOCTOR X374
And have you been watching what you eat?

PATIENT X374
Now I can't say I've been watching greatly but I have been yes watching it.

DOCTOR X374
What have your uh, what has your fasting glucose been like in the morning.  Like this morning what was it?  Do you check it every morning?

PATIENT X374
Oh yeah.  @@@ I check it, I usually try to check it every morning but I'm usually in the 120s and many times lower in the morning.

DOCTOR X374
What was it yesterday?

PATIENT X374
Uh yesterday it was 119 yesterday.

DOCTOR X374
Okay.  

PATIENT X374
I have, like I say, I'll get up into the high 120s sometimes.  It's just the way.

DOCTOR X374
What's the highest it's ever been?

PATIENT X374
In the mornings 137 I believe it was.  Over this last couple of months.

DOCTOR X374
Yeah that A1c that you got from @@@ was like 130s, 120s you know.

PATIENT X374
It's during the day I think that it spikes on me pretty bad.  Uh I've had lows in the middle of the night uh when they first gave me that Aspart, then I'd have to get up and I'd have to drink something, some sugary drink or get some hard candy and I noticed that affects me when I take my morning sugar.  Uh but and I'm not eating much in the morning.  Yeah but when I eat.

DOCTOR X374
It doesn't help yeah.  For diabetics, like for other people it doesn't matter but for diabetics, it's more important that you eat every day @@@.

PATIENT X374
Yes but what I do @@@.  But I eat; I may have dinner at 10-10:30 a night.  I think that affects me because of the way I work.

DOCTOR X374
What do you do?

PATIENT X374
Uh I do network stuff and I work odd hours, depends on when I'm called and what I'm doing.

DOCTOR X374
But think about it if you eat late and then you go to bed late.

PATIENT X374
Yeah.

DOCTOR X374
You know.

PATIENT X374
I think that's one of the main problems right there.  I've got this, I'm trying to change jobs right and I change what I do to get expanded out but I find myself eating @@@ constant now and I told my other doctor the same thing.  I mean I got to work and that sort of work is not really four or five @@@ there but never that late and I know that's the problem.  

DOCTOR X374
You didn't hurt your leg, like you didn't have.

PATIENT X374
Oh no, no, no.  @@@.  No it just started hurting @@@.

DOCTOR X374

PATIENT X374
Yes.

DOCTOR X374
Alright.  Have you ever been started on gabapentin?

PATIENT X374
What is it, I had the gabapentin, I think it caused me some problems.

DOCTOR X374
Okay, that's the only thing that'll relieve some of the numbness and burning.

PATIENT X374
Uh.

DOCTOR X374
That's for a diabetic otherwise there's nothing else then.

PATIENT X374
Yeah well I might have to start taking it again then.

DOCTOR X374

PATIENT X374
But I'm trying to remember what the gabapentin did, I don't remember.

DOCTOR X374
Sleepy?

PATIENT X374

DOCTOR X374
Did you have a cut on your feet?

PATIENT X374
Huh, no I didn't have.

PATIENT X374
Cause of what?

DOCTOR X374
Your toes.

PATIENT X374
On the nails?

DOCTOR X374
Well you know on your skin and your feet.  The thing is when people have fungus it cracks your skin and because it cracks bacteria can get in and then it @@@ the bacteria up.

DOCTOR X374

PATIENT X374
The fungus?

DOCTOR X374

Whenever you get something that's cracking like in cold winter and it kind of gets raw and cracks open.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
For bacteria and guess what, you're a diabetic and @@@.

DOCTOR X374
You can put on your shoes now.

DOCTOR OUT:  28:10   DOCTOR IN:  35:42

DOCTOR X374
Alright sir.  So I'll have you come back in a week to visit the nurse and see if that infection is looking better, so I'll have come back for a nurse visit in one week and then I think we need to see you, just to see your primary care physician.  So I know you take a bath every day but I'm gonna try to mark it and see if you can try to avoid cleaning the mark off so when the nurse sees you in a week she can see if that redness has gone down, right in here.

PATIENT X374
Yeah.  All I take is a shower uh.

DOCTOR X374
Just kind of dab around it and try to avoid @@@.

PATIENT X374
Getting the water on it.

DOCTOR X374
Yeah or at least washing the marker so we can see if um.

PATIENT X374
So what I need to do is wash around that area.

DOCTOR X374
Yeah I think so yeah.  I would say right here, right like that.

PATIENT X374
Yeah.  All around the bone area.

DOCTOR X374
Okay.

PATIENT X374
A little soap.

DOCTOR X374
You should try to wash, does it hurt here?

PATIENT X374

DOCTOR X374
Tell me when it does.

PATIENT X374
Yeah right, right there.

DOCTOR X374
Okay.  Alright well you know just clean and try not to wash off and we'll see, we can see if it's, you know what I mean.

PATIENT X374
Keep in front of the mark there.

DOCTOR X374
Yeah.

PATIENT X374
Alcohol would take it off at the end of the day.

DOCTOR X374
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X374
Let me ask you a question, if you get @@@ stand in here this is a skin infection you say?

DOCTOR X374
Yeah.  It's called cellulitis.

PATIENT X374
That's exactly the area where the pins sticking me.

DOCTOR X374
Oh yeah.  

PATIENT X374
Okay that's why I can see.

DOCTOR X374
And uh cellulitis is not like cellulitis on you see on girl's butt hanging down.

PATIENT X374
There on the rear.

DOCTOR X374
So it's uh @@@ I just want to make sure @@@ so of the underlying area of the skin.

PATIENT X374
So what am I supposed to do?

DOCTOR X374
You're gonna pick up Keflex antibiotic and gabapentin, I'm gonna start you on a low dose alright.  @@@.  Do have your doctor, you're real doctor @@@ put you on a higher dose based on your symptoms and titrate it a little bit up.

PATIENT X374
The gabapentin?

DOCTOR X374
With the gabapentin.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
Okay.  Uh get it at the window and then you can let them know that you want it mailed, that you want it mailed out to you.

PATIENT X374
No I want @@@.

DOCTOR X374
No like I know that it's at the window and then you tell them at the window make the changes to mail it that you have to go someplace, you know what I mean.

PATIENT X374
Okay, yeah.  Could I have been bitten by something also?

DOCTOR X374
Well this is another thing sometimes yes it could be spider bites.

PATIENT X374
Yeah because I had a rat and I had to have the house fumigated.  

DOCTOR X374
Right.

PATIENT X374
White spiders.

DOCTOR X374
But the most common reason might be because of that fungus.

PATIENT X374
Fungus yeah okay.

DOCTOR X374
And because you're a diabetic.  The likelihood of it being a spider bite is really low.

PATIENT X374
Okay.  @@@ anything you know @@@.

DOCTOR X374
Oh of cellulitis?

PATIENT X374
No the uh.

DOCTOR X374
Fungus?  @@@  So I @@@ give you medication for the fungus for now, I want to treat the infection first.

PATIENT X374
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X374
And then once everything starts resolving you should definitely 
bring it up with your primary care physician.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
Or your doctor, whoever it is.

PATIENT X374
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X374
I don't know, @@@ he said I had fungus and I have cellulitis.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
He'll give you something for it.

PATIENT X374
Put that in, you got that in there right?

DOCTOR X374
Yeah I'm gonna write in there but I'm not gonna give you anything for the fungal yet but I'm gonna give you the antibiotics.  I'm primarily looking to see anything else that @@@ really better so.

PATIENT X374
Well we'll see if it's from a bit or from @@@.

DOCTOR X374
@@@ having some pus or anything like that.  We'll see you in seven days.

PATIENT X374
@@@ antibiotics, think that'll do it?

DOCTOR X374
Huh?

PATIENT X374
Think that'll do it?

DOCTOR X374
Yeah so you're saying five so @@@.  Given this is my first time but you can't go @@@.  If you take care of your sugar it'll @@@ faster.

PATIENT X374
@@@.

DOCTOR X374
So why would you do that?

PATIENT X374
Yeah I think this @@@.

DOCTOR X374
Do you smoke?

PATIENT X374
No.

DOCTOR X374
Oh that's good.  Um how about at least for this week you like check your sugar a little more often, just for this week.  I mean you should do it all the time.  I'm just saying.

PATIENT X374
I usually try to get it at night and in the day and sometimes I have time to get it done.

DOCTOR X374
And try to avoid the potatoes.

PATIENT X374
@@@.

DOCTOR X374
I know, I know @@@.  Something, let's help this along.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
I know this is bad to tell you this but I just at least to help you for this week why don't act like you're a good patient right now for the week so this could get better alright?

PATIENT X374
I'll do that.

DOCTOR X374
So what you could do is avoid bread this week.

PATIENT X374
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X374
Try to eat like more wheat if you don't eat bread, try to avoid potatoes, macaroni and cheese.

PATIENT X374
I don't even like macaroni and cheese.

DOCTOR X374
No pasta, spaghetti and noodles and the white rice.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
So no chicken fried rice from you know a Chinese restaurant.  So do that for this week so your sugar is being monitored because I want you to take that insulin because your body's like whoa I'm not having carbs and that insulin really works too little alright so you've got to be careful.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
You need to understand what I'm saying cause if you're avoiding the bad stuff your sugars will start getting lower.

PATIENT X374
I'm gonna have to adjust the insulin.

DOCTOR X374
Yes exactly.

PATIENT X374
So if I eat more of the vegetables.

DOCTOR X374
Yes, if you have any steaks boom.  Um green beans.

PATIENT X374
I eat not too much steaks, I don't take too much anymore.

DOCTOR X374
Or chicken with green beans and with vegetables instead of that nice baked potato.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
So make sure that's.

PATIENT X374
But some nice veggies.

DOCTOR X374
Well you know just a week so we can help this out for the @@@.

PATIENT X374
I will do that.

DOCTOR X374
Okay and then after that it's up to you but let's give it at least start a habit.

PATIENT X374
I'll start a habit.

DOCTOR X374
Just give it a chance alright.

PATIENT X374
Okay.

DOCTOR X374
Otherwise you have the medications, the orders.

PATIENT X374
And I'm just coming back in a week to see the nurse.

DOCTOR X374
Yeah.

PATIENT X374

DOCTOR X374
Well try to see what they can arrange for you, tell them it's because of an infection.

PATIENT X374

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  I'm not trying to torture you.

PATIENT X731

Can I put it down?

DOCTOR X731
Yeah you can put that down now.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731

PATIENT X731
No.  There's no actual swelling in there.

DOCTOR X731
No.

PATIENT X731
But it swells up and goes down you know.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  When that happens, if it does swell up you can always put ice on it.

PATIENT X731
Right.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  You can always put a bag of ice or a bag of cold peas or whatever.

PATIENT X731
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X731
Something like that.  Um but what I'm gonna do is maybe get an x-ray of this.

PATIENT X731
Oh wow.

DOCTOR X731
Okay because I want to see if you have osteoarthritis.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Osteoarthritis is when the space in between two bones shrinks.

PATIENT X731
Right.

DOCTOR X731
When you get bone on bone.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  That's very painful to people okay.  Um and it's painful kind of all the time, anytime you move.

PATIENT X731
Right @@@.

DOCTOR X731
Yeah I mean it doesn't seem like there is one particular thing that makes this a lot worse uh it just kind of bothers you.

PATIENT X731
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Um it's a tough thing to treat, I'll just tell you.  It's a tough thing to treat because there isn't a good surgery for this.

PATIENT X731
No.

DOCTOR X731
Uh you know so the thing that I need to make sure is that your bones, the health of your bones overall.

PATIENT X731
Right.

DOCTOR X731

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Uh let me just look at your last set of labs that we got for you okay.

DOCTOR X731
Um you know you can get that anywhere but I can, I mean I can do that too through the VA.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
No PATIENT let's talk about the chest pain.

PATIENT X731
Okay good.

DOCTOR X731
Okay because the chest pain is not from your heart.

PATIENT X731
Just from my old appointment you said.

DOCTOR X731
Well you've got an aneurysm but that that doesn't cause chest pain.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  We're gonna continue to monitor that.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Okay probably with you know maybe we'll get a picture about every year.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
And follow you for that.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Um but there's nothing new.

PATIENT X731
Right.

DOCTOR X731
And that's not the cause of this pain.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
So but you're still having pain.  I believe you.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
So we've got to figure out what.

PATIENT X731
What do we do?

DOCTOR X731
Uh what is that pain and what can we do about it.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Now I need you to think really hard.  Does the pain that you get in the chest is it ever related to food ever?

PATIENT X731
No.

DOCTOR X731
Never.

PATIENT X731
No.

DOCTOR X731
And when I mean that, I mean.

PATIENT X731
Primary pain.

DOCTOR X731
Is there pain with particular kinds of food?

PATIENT X731
No.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Are there, is there any relation like you eat a meal and between 30 minutes or an hour later you have pain.

PATIENT X731
You mean do I get gas or something like that?

DOCTOR X731
Yeah.

PATIENT X731
No I don't get gas.

DOCTOR X731
Well it's not just gas.  There's something called acid reflux.

PATIENT X731
Let me tell you what it is.  Sharp pain.

DOCTOR X731
It's sharp pain.

PATIENT X731
Right in here.

DOCTOR X731
And how long does it last?

PATIENT X731
Well sometimes it lasts four, five hours.  Sometimes it can come @@@ it will cause me to take aspirin every once in a while.  I took them up but it still hurts.  The aspirin don't do anything you know, like when I'm just about really go do it, @@@ you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X731
You don't okay.  Um not, no spicy foods, it makes this worse?

PATIENT X731
No, no.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Coffee even.

PATIENT X731
Well I drink a lot of coffee.  I don't know what's been making it going on.

DOCTOR X731
How much coffee do you drink?

PATIENT X731
About two cups a day.

DOCTOR X731
Oh that's not too bad.

PATIENT X731
Hmm.

DOCTOR X731
I thought you were gonna say like ten.

PATIENT X731
No. No.

DOCTOR X731
Okay so two cups of coffee is okay.

PATIENT X731
Maybe two big cups, you know I only take it to try to get up in the morning you know.

DOCTOR X731
Yeah okay.  Um and you smoke.

PATIENT X731
Right, right.

DOCTOR X731
Okay um.

PATIENT X731

DOCTOR X731
Ever?

PATIENT X731
Now I had a beer about two, three days ago yeah.

DOCTOR X731
Okay so just rarely?

PATIENT X731
Rarely, very rarely cause I don't want to drink nothing I my son and his wife and there's gonna be a birth of a baby coming up.  I could give you one thing and that's what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X731
Uh cocaine, marijuana anything @@@.

PATIENT X731
No, that stuff will kill me.  No.

DOCTOR X731
No, no.

PATIENT X731
When I was a kid I used to have marijuana you know.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Now I want you to go forward, I want you to go up.

PATIENT X731

PATIENT X731
A little pain, but not much.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Well.

PATIENT X731
It sure is not gas was it.

DOCTOR X731
No I think it's a muscle.

PATIENT X731
Hmm.

DOCTOR X731
That, just doing that much and it causes pain.

PATIENT X731
No not this one over here does.

DOCTOR X731
That one over there?

PATIENT X731
Yeah.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Okay.  Um what do you do with that arm?

PATIENT X731
What do I do with that arm?

DOCTOR X731

PATIENT X731
Sleep on it.

DOCTOR X731

DOCTOR X731
You.

PATIENT X731
@@@.

DOCTOR X731
Okay like do you like, do you have you know small children or anything you have to pick up?

PATIENT X731
Oh yeah, yeah, my grandson's he's at least six months so I tell her I can't hold him too long, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X731
Yeah.

PATIENT X731
That's why, he weighs about 20 pounds, 25 pounds, something like that.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  My friend, I think that this is a muscle pain.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
So what I want you to do is rest and ice it.

PATIENT X731
Hmm.

DOCTOR X731
I want you to keep something cold on there.

Okay.

PATIENT X731
Hmm.

DOCTOR X731
This is gonna get better.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  If it persists then maybe it is something like gas.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
But I'm not gonna give you another medicine right now cause I'm not suspicious that this is gas.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
I'm more suspicious that this is a muscle.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
I do think it might be worth getting a picture of the knee just to see that there isn't anything that is really abnormal and to see if this could be osteoarthritis.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  Um and again this has been a long term pain issue for you.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  I think that you moving is a great idea because being around lots of cockroaches and mice.

DOCTOR X731
Okay well it could be a headache.  But I mean it could be migraines.

PATIENT X731
Hmm.

DOCTOR X731
Um there are medicines that are available that you can take once the headache starts.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Um I haven't prescribed it to people here at the VA cause I haven't had too many folks that have true migraines.

PATIENT X731
Yeah.

DOCTOR X731
This could be true migraines um, let me see if they have them.  

PATIENT X731
And I hate to tell you this but before you gave me some Viagra.

DOCTOR X731
Yeah.

PATIENT X731
One pill cause that what worked, come on I had the only one pill, one pill?

DOCTOR X731
I didn't give you just one.  Now listen the VA restricts me.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
Okay.  I'm only allowed to give you two pills a month.  If it was only one that was a mistake.  It was meant to be two.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Um but the issue, here I'm changing this right now.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Um I don't know why the VA does this.  You know you were in the Army you know or some service and now they want to control every part of your life.  I don't know what the story is behind that but they only let me prescribe two pills a month.

PATIENT X731
I only got one.  Now you see what I'm saying, one pill.

DOCTOR X731
Yeah.

PATIENT X731
One pill, one pill you know get your girlfriend or something, you know what I mean and she want to do some more.

DOCTOR X731
Yeah.  Okay my friend.  Um when I look at this uh the medicine that I was thinking I wanted to give you.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
It turns out I can only give to you if I'm a neurologist.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.  Well is the fact that @@@ well you the doctor, @@@ what do you think about that?

DOCTOR X731
We talked about that.  They want to monitor that in a year.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
There's nothing to do.  There's no problem related to your heart.

PATIENT X731
Right.

DOCTOR X731
You're heart's healthy but you do have a little bit of dilation of the aorta.

PATIENT X731
Right.

DOCTOR X731
And there's nothing to do about it.  We're just gonna monitor it.

PATIENT X731
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X731
To make sure that it doesn't, if it gets bigger, eventually you might have to have a surgery.

PATIENT X731
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X731
But right now there isn't any indication to have to do that okay.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
I can uh you know, I can refer you to the neurologist.

PATIENT X731
No, no.

DOCTOR X731
For the headache and they can prescribe you the medicine for, specific for migraines.  From the sound of it, it could be migraines.

PATIENT X731
Hmm.  Let's hope it is cause I don't want to take @@@.  I can't come over here, I got to stay all the way.

DOCTOR X731
Right, right, right @@@.

PATIENT X731
Hospital @@@.

DOCTOR X731
You're not taking the right medicine for migraine.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
I want to give you something but the VA is limiting me.  I can't give you this medicine unless I'm a neurologist so I can send you to the neurologist and they can assess your headaches.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
And see if they will do it.

PATIENT X731
Alright, alright, alright, alright.  I was telling you that.

PATIENT X731
Okay.

DOCTOR X731
Yeah well it's kind of you're getting to the end of the flu season but do you need a flu shot?

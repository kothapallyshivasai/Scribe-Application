DOCTOR X477
Right.  You know if you need to follow up with them, you can always do that.  Actually they did want to see you again you know and maybe they'll go into @@@ okay.

PATIENT X477
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X477
They probably think, if it comes down to it, what they can do is take a sample, like a you know a small biopsy and review it under the microscope.

PATIENT X477
Why they have to do all that?

DOCTOR X477
No sometimes.  They, that's why they didn't do it yet but if its something that's really bothering you and it's not getting better you know we can, do you know what I mean?

PATIENT X477
Yeah.

DOCTOR X477
Okay.  Uh yeah they actually wrote in their note that they want to see you another time.  That's what they said.

DOCTOR X477
Okay, see if they can, they'll probably have to reschedule though.  Can I do a quick exam?

PATIENT X477
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X477

PATIENT X477
No.

DOCTOR X477

PATIENT X477
Same amount, a pack a day.

DOCTOR X477
Pack a day.  Want to quit?

PATIENT X477
Yeah that's why; I don't want to take this medicine with the nebulizer.

DOCTOR X477
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X477
Get rid of this cough and then use the patches I got.

DOCTOR X477
You have the patches already?

PATIENT X477
Yeah.

DOCTOR X477
I think you should try using them.

PATIENT X477
Yeah.

DOCTOR X477
And you don't have to wait until the cough is gone.

PATIENT X477
Yeah.

DOCTOR X477
If anything that's probably a good time because the smoking is probably going to make the cough worse.

PATIENT X477
Yeah but that's @@@.

DOCTOR X477
Take a deep breath.  Is there anything new about the cough or is it just @@@?  Are you coughing up junk?  You got any mucous?

 
DOCTOR X143
PATIENT?  Hi, how you doing?

PATIENT X143
Uh tired.

DOCTOR X143
Tired, @@@.

PATIENT X143
Yeah no I'm not sleeping good these days.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  What's wrong with the sleeping?

PATIENT X143
I wish I had an answer for you.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
Uh some of it I can anticipate.  Whatever, I'm waking up in the middle of the night with pain laying on my side, roll over the pain goes away but uh that doesn't happen all the time, just rather infrequent and I just can't sleep.  Last night I got about four hours sleep.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  Are you sleeping at all during the day?

PATIENT X143
Occasionally I'll take a nap but that's occasional.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  Um how much coffee do you drink?

PATIENT X143
Uh let's see maybe a cup or two in the morning.  I make sure I don't drink anything late at night.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
I even stopped drinking iced tea to uh you know do it early in the day.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  What time do you try to go to sleep?

PATIENT X143
Generally about 9:30 after the news.  Last night it was at 11 o'clock cause I was watching the Cubs game.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  Um so number one, your sleep hygiene is pretty decent um.

PATIENT X143
My sleep hygiene, I'm sorry?

DOCTOR X143
So uh sleep hygiene is taking no naps during the day.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
And um limiting caffeine intake.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
So um those are two things that you can do to help yourself sleep better.

PATIENT X143
Obviously I'm doing that but it's not working.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.  Um so I can give you medications to help you fall asleep at night um but one the medications can make you feel a little drowsy when you wake up.

PATIENT X143
I'll hold off on that just so you're aware that I'm having problems but uh.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  Um, all I can say is try to uh, limit even more so maybe your caffeine intake in the morning.

PATIENT X143
Hmm, two cups?

DOCTOR X143
And I know.  I, if somebody told me to stop drinking coffee I'd probably say no but if somebody said okay now put yourself in the shoes of not being able to sleep at all.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
Then I'd consider it then.  Um and then no naps during the day.  Um, obviously no caffeine at night um and then trying to eliminate any sort of distractions like closing the windows or.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
Um shutting any doors.

PATIENT X143
Sounds, drown out sounds right.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.  Uh I can give you medication to help you get to sleep um.  What I tend to do with medications is sleep aids, is any sleep aid is a possibility of becoming addictive, meaning if you take it long enough, eventually you need that to get to sleep.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
And you can't sleep without it.

PATIENT X143
Therefore I will say no at this point.

DOCTOR X143
But what I tell my patients who have problems sleeping is and I give them sleep medication is the medication is not for every night.  The medication is for one or two nights a week in which you say oh my God I didn't sleep last night and I didn't sleep well the night before and I got a big test due tomorrow and or I got a big thing to do at work and I have to get some sleep tonight.  I cannot deal with you know staying awake all night.

PATIENT X143
I don't want to take any of it right now period.

DOCTOR X143
Okay, that's fine.  Um how about, what else is going on?

PATIENT X143
Well I'm curious to know what was the results of the two tests that I had, the CAT scan or whatever else that I had.  Haven't heard anything.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.  Um so you had an ultrasound of your thyroid.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
It was normal.  

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
It still sees that you have some nodules on your thyroid.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
And that your thyroid is a little bit enlarged but it's not any different from the last time they checked it.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
It's about a millimeter bigger.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
Um.  There's a CT scan.  You have some evidence maybe of some sinusitis.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
Which is inflammation in your sinuses.  Did you have surgery on your sinuses before?

PATIENT X143
Long time ago.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  They mentioned that you had some results with some surgery.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh, many years ago.

DOCTOR X143
Uh.  You have a polyp in your sinuses.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
Um, the polyp is uh can possibly cause some uh sinus congestion and if you wanted to I can refer you to the ENT surgeons and they can look at possibly removing that.

PATIENT X143
At the moment it's probably a lot better than it has been in years.  The congestion that I've had literally, I've been here twice in the Emergency Room and uh that has almost completely cleared up.  the only time I have a problem is when I'm first waking up in the morning and one of the nostrils will be uh basically clogged and it's you know.

DOCTOR X143
Are you uh using the spray?

PATIENT X143
The spray, yeah.

DOCTOR X143
Okay good.

PATIENT X143
It's working.

DOCTOR X143
And how about the pills?

PATIENT X143
Which pills are you referring to.  I got so many of them.

DOCTOR X143
The loratadine, it's basically Claritin.

PATIENT X143
I believe so.  I got a list; let me see, which did you say it was?

DOCTOR X143
Loratadine.  Lorat

PATIENT X143
Lor, okay, take one tab oh yeah okay.  It comes wrapped in a silver foil yeah.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.

PATIENT X143
They have me cut that yeah.

DOCTOR X143
Then great, then they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing.

PATIENT X143
They were yes okay.

DOCTOR X143
I'm glad you took them regularly.  Some people take them for three, four days and then they say this doesn't work at all and they throw it away or they take them for like whenever they have a problem and it doesn't really fix the problem.  It's a medicine that's meant to be taken every day or every day during the season.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
In which you have problems with nasal congestion or something like that.

PATIENT X143
I should mention that I had uh two infected toes after I clipped my nails, soaked them in Epsom salt and groin salve and it cleared it up so.

DOCTOR X143
Good.  

PATIENT X143
I'm trying to understand what's going on with my thyroid.  Uh a week or so ago we were going out to eat so I took my blood sugar before we went out.  It was at 186.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
Uh I went to the restaurant, ate, figured it was going to shoot way up, came back uh it was down to 111.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
Took my evening medication, it went back, so it was about an hour and a half between the first and second reading, about an hour after, for the third reading and it was up to 116 after I'd taken the medication.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
So it didn't seem to make sense that it would be 186 and then drop down to 111 without medication then go back up to 116 with the medication.  

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
I don't understand that.

DOCTOR X143
Uh I don't have an explanation for it either.  That's not usually the way the medications work.

PATIENT X143
That.

DOCTOR X143
I don't know if maybe it took a while for the medication to.

PATIENT X143
You know what I'm saying is I hadn't had the medication since that morning and I go out in the evening to eat and it's 186.

DOCTOR X143
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X143
And I had a fairly regular day so I didn't see any reason why I should and I still don't understand why it went down to 111 without medication.  I am really concerned about just how accurate or what is going on.

DOCTOR X143
Well the meters can be inaccurate uh.

PATIENT X143
That I can believe yeah.

DOCTOR X143
But if you get an inaccurate number you can always recheck it again and see if you get the same number um.  Usually if you recheck it and you get the same number, the machine is fairly accurate if you repeat the value.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
And if it's the same it's.

PATIENT X143
So what you're saying you really can't be, you don't have enough information to be able to say.

DOCTOR X143
Exactly.  If you were in the hospital and this sort of thing happened you know, I would have a more controlled environment.  I'd be able to know exactly what you ate; I'd be able to know
when you got your medication and.

PATIENT X143
I'm going to cut you off and everything.  When I was in here in the Emergency Room I was in here for three days.

DOCTOR X143
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X143
One time they came in did a blood test and the technician who did the blood test, ah you've been cheating and I hadn't basically been out of the room.  I hadn't had anything but what had been served to me.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
So literally I'm saying something doesn't seem right.

DOCTOR X143
You mean cause your blood sugar was high?

PATIENT X143
Yes.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.

PATIENT X143
Yeah.

DOCTOR X143
I don't know if it was because uh the carbs and that were more than what you should've gotten or what.

PATIENT X143
It doesn't make sense but you know I am concerned about it.  You know literally that it's just that inconsistent and I know I basically have been.  When I cheat I cheat okay, but I can account for it but there was nothing in this case, either of these cases.

DOCTOR X143
All I can tell you is that as long as your blood sugars aren't dropping to low levels where you're below 70s uh or they're not.

PATIENT X143
Once I think.

DOCTOR X143
They're not regularly really high like regularly above 200, I'm happy with things being in the middle.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
And uh I would adjust medications based upon your hemoglobin A1c, which is the number I measure in the clinic.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
That we measure which is a long term measure of your blood sugars and your sugars over 3-4 months, kind of what it averages and so that's a number that we like below 7.  We have good data that shows that if we keep people below 7 they have better outcomes.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.  Actually I was surprised I wasn't asked to come in for a blood test this time around but uh.

DOCTOR X143
Oh let's see when your last cholesterol panel was.  I was looking at you're thyroid hormone study.

PATIENT X143
How long ago was that, I'm trying to remember?

DOCTOR X143
The thyroid study was done on the 21st of April.  So it shows basically that, your numbers show that you might have a little bit too much thyroid medication, very, very little too much.

PATIENT X143
Okay.  If it's too much that could also relate to why I'm having trouble sleeping.

DOCTOR X143
Uh that's possible but it's only very slightly elevated.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
To the point that I might consider not even doing anything about it.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
Uh but let me look and see what the Endocrine doctor said.  Now I see normal is 0.76-1.46, you're 1.59.  It's just barely above the upper limit of normal.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
You take two thyroid pills every day right?

PATIENT X143
That is correct.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  And the endocrinologist said they wanted to see you back.

PATIENT X143
Hmm, I haven't heard anything so.

DOCTOR X143
I think you have an appointment coming up.  Your hemoglobin A1c was better last time.

PATIENT X143
What does that mean was good?

DOCTOR X143
So 6.9 um, our goal for this is less than 7.  This is a measure of your long term sugars over the last three months.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
The way it works is called glycosylated hemoglobin or hemoglobin A1c.  Hemoglobin is uh a compound that's inside of all of your red blood cells; it's what stores the oxygen in your blood.

PATIENT X143
So.

DOCTOR X143
So the higher your sugars are in your blood, cause sugar sticks to those hemoglobin molecules.

PATIENT X143
So basically we're on track is what you're saying.

DOCTOR X143
So we measure the amount of sugar that's stuck to those and that gives me an average of your sugars for the last three or four months.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
So uh 6.9 is below the guidelines of 7 so you're between 6.5 and 7 is the goal.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
Looks good.  So no change in those medications and blood pressure looks good.  I think we'll just uh keep everything there as it is.  Uh, did you start taking fish oil tablets?

PATIENT X143
Yes I have been.

DOCTOR X143
Oh good.

PATIENT X143
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X143
Good and you've had a colonoscopy before right?

PATIENT X143
Uh that's no surgery no.  Oh the colonoscopy that's the rectum.

DOCTOR X143
Right.

PATIENT X143
Yes, that's colon what am I thinking.  I've had it at least twice here.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah I was just looking at that.  Um.

PATIENT X143
I shouldn't need another one for a couple of years, for years maybe.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah you don't need another one for another six years.

PATIENT X143
Ah good.

DOCTOR X143
And I think everything looks good and I think, oh I was thinking you know what.  Another thing I want to my boss about seeing whether or not we should go down on that dose of uh Synthroid.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
Cause you've been having trouble sleeping and your numbers are a little bit high.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
I think that that would be a good thing to do.

PATIENT X143
Two things I have to mentioned really, on a scale of 1-10 I'm getting pains of about 1 level okay.  Uh I had gallbladder surgery, every once in a while, within a few hours after eating, I can feel pain in that same area.  It doesn't make sense.

DOCTOR X143
Which area?

PATIENT X143
Right about here is where I had the pain when I had the gallbladder okay.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
Uh the other one, this goes back 40 years, uh when I was in Vietnam I had my morning bowel movement and I happened to notice a lump in my left cheek.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
Went into the clinic, they looked at it, come back after where I'm taking care of everybody and the operator's right there, the local anesthetic pulled out a lump that was probably about that size and I remember a big mass.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
And I don't know, that was the end of that you know I got shipped home shortly thereafter so the paperwork probably got lost on the thing but literally it was just a slit over the part and excised.

DOCTOR X143
You probably had a lipoma.

PATIENT X143
Yeah probably but anyway that area is starting to feel sore again every once in a while and I can't figure, it doesn't make.

DOCTOR X143
Are there any lumps back there?

PATIENT X143
Uh I haven't been able to feel any lumps back there.

DOCTOR X143
Do you want me to check to see if I can feel any lumps back there?

PATIENT X143
Uh I would appreciate it yeah, you know.

DOCTOR X143
Um and then as far as the pain goes here, are you having any diarrhea at all?

PATIENT X143
My uh bowel movements are erratic.

DOCTOR X143
That's right I remember now.

PATIENT X143
The same thing you know literally hard to very loose and I basically cannot predict.  If I drink too much milk or diet I know it's going to be loose okay.  If I drink too much alcohol or even sometimes just a little bit of alcohol, it hardens up.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
So I can predict the cause of that anyway.

DOCTOR X143
Sure.

PATIENT X143
Control for it.

DOCTOR X143
Uh so the reason I ask is pain down on this side I think of two main things, one would be um hard stools and the other would be diverticulosis.  Diverticulosis is where your colon instead of being a nice even tube.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
For the stool, you get these little out pouching on the side of it, almost like a pocket for your pain.

PATIENT X143
I vaguely remember when I had the colonoscopy somebody made a, one of the technicians or whatever was doing it, a doctor I don't know, um made a remark about that.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  Let's just take a look at it.

PATIENT X143
I’m surprised I remember I'm supposed to be knocked out in there, it didn't knock me out so I was hearing a lot of things that maybe I shouldn't have.  

DOCTOR X143
Yes diverticulosis.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
So sometimes those can get irritated or inflamed.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
Uh and usually that stuff is self-limiting, it goes away.  If you start to feel really sick, like nauseous, sick to your stomach, having fevers, that would be a symptom that those burrows have gotten infected and so you need to come in to the hospital, but I think a little bit of pain down in that area, I wouldn't do anything about it at this point.  You might just have a little bit of a low grade @@@.

PATIENT X143
Yeah you know basically the reason I had the gallbladder out, I think it was the gallbladder yeah, it was the West Side VA Hospital.  Anyway I had been to; I hadn't been in there since the Light Castle.

DOCTOR X143
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X143
And so this very greasy food.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.

PATIENT X143
And within 24 hours I had somebody drive me to the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.

PATIENT X143
So and basically it's the same area of feeling the pain but definitely not as intense.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
So.  Anyhow, you want to look at and see.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah.  I'll take a look at it.

PATIENT X143
Okay.  Pull them down I guess right?

DOCTOR X143
Is it about here?

PATIENT X143
Yeah right where you had your thumb a second ago.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.  

PATIENT X143
As I recall it was more, yeah got something there.

DOCTOR X143
Hold on.  Probably just one of your muscles back there.

PATIENT X143
Yeah.

DOCTOR X143
I don't feel any tumors.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
So.  So uh lipomas are a benign tumor.  It's basically just fat cells in your body.

PATIENT X143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X143
That proliferate too much, they multiply too much.

PATIENT X143
That's one of two that I've had.  Another time I had another one, about two inches below my.

DOCTOR X143
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X143
Right on the spinal cord.

DOCTOR X143
Oh wow.

PATIENT X143
Yeah.

DOCTOR X143
Those are the problems with those is you get, they're benign but if they come into a spot that's.

PATIENT X143
Yeah.

DOCTOR X143
A delicate area.

PATIENT X143
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X143
Then removing it can become difficult.

PATIENT X143
Fortunately the girl I was dating at the time felt it and called it to my attention.  So you want me to wait while you check with your supervisor.

DOCTOR X143
Yeah exactly so.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
The only thing I think we're going to talk about with him is possibly @@@ the insulin dose.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
And then the endocrine doctor wanted to see you back um and they also wanted to see you back with a repeat ultrasound of your neck so what they wanted to do is give you more of the Synthroid medication and see if there are some nodules in the thyroid, see if they disappear.  @@@.

PATIENT X143
Will they notify me or what, I was going to ask you.

DOCTOR X143
So what I'll do is I'll put in a request and they'll call you.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
About uh setting up the Endocrine appointment.

PATIENT X143
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X143
Okay and I'll, I'll talk to my boss to see whether we want to repeat the ultrasound now or.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
Wait @@@.

(DOCTOR OUT:  162:4  DOCTOR IN:  168.18)

DOCTOR X143
Okie doke.  

PATIENT X143
Okay what happens?

DOCTOR X143
So he wants me to refer you or have you see DOCTOR um and then repeat your thyroid studies today and then based.

PATIENT X143
Oh go downstairs to the yeah okay.

DOCTOR X143
Lab, yeah get a blood draw.  Um and repeat those studies today and if they're still elevated.

PATIENT X143
Hmm.

DOCTOR X143
Or even if they're more elevated then I'll give you a call at home.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
To increase that dose.

PATIENT X143
Okay and I just happened to notice that this being up for a renewal, I only have one more refill between now and August.

DOCTOR X143
I'll go ahead; I go through all my patients' medications.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
When I read your note and I'll make sure all your refills are up-to-date.

PATIENT X143
So by the time I get downstairs to the Lab they will have the work order for me or whatever is required?

DOCTOR X143
Uh-huh, I'm putting it in right now.  When should I see you back six months?

PATIENT X143
Sounds good to me.  Unless something transpires between now and then regarding the.

DOCTOR X143
Okay.

PATIENT X143
Okay take that out there?

DOCTOR X143
Yep.

PATIENT X143
Thank you very much, see you in six months.

DOCTOR X143
See you in six months; try to stay out of trouble.

PATIENT X143
@@@ at my age?  Take care.

DOCTOR X143
And I put on the bottom there, I wrote on the bottom of that sheet that they should just set you up with DOCTOR.  I shouldn't have to put anything in the computer for it because you've already seen her, that it's just a follow-up appointment.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

DOCTOR X143
They should be able to schedule you with that okay, but should you have a problem just come back over here.

PATIENT X143
Okay.

PATIENT LEAVES:  171:30

What I've been thinking about at this point of time is to @@@.

@@@ from you is @@@ the problem you are having but from another @@@ you know, @@@ just because I don't want all this information @@@.

Just because @@@.

PATIENT X35
Okay, @@@.

DOCTOR X35
@@@ right.

DOCTOR X35
That is the reason okay.  Uh Actually I won't be able to give you an answer uh at the same time it would make very @@@ as far as your prostate problem is concerned, @@@ okay.  How do you take that?  Because @@@ possible for me to get all the information from there uh from the computer and at the same time

Oh, okay.

DOCTOR X35
And then you come up to the @@@.

PATIENT X35
@@@.

DOCTOR X35
@@@ right.

And that is how the @@@ work most of the time uh.  Because many of the times @@@ and @@@.  That is how it goes, okay.  @@@ prostate problem, this is not a small deal, this is something @@@ right.  I would need to gather the proper information from them, from you and from @@@.

PATIENT X35

SECOND DOCTOR X35

PATIENT X35
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X35
Um our question is whether you want to go ahead and start that @@@ at xxx Brown uh but ultimately we would like to maybe follow up with that, so I guess the question is do you want us to order that today or if you would want um, if you want to just have it over there, it's your call.

PATIENT X35
What kind of blood test are you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR X35
It's a blood test.  We'd check your thyroid levels, we'd check your um, um, @@@.  We'd check your thyroid levels, we'd check your iron levels um and we'd check your vitamin levels as well @@@.

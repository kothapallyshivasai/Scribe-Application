PATIENT X298
Good how you doing?

DOCTOR X298
Good.  @@@.

PATIENT X298
You the doctor?

DOCTOR X298
Yep.

PATIENT X298
A new one.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
A new one, every year I come here I get a new doctor.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah, sorry about that.  I'm going to stay uh.  @@@.  My name is @@@.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
I'm one of the residents here um.  I'm going to stay for three years so.

PATIENT X298
Oh well I have you a couple more years then huh.

DOCTOR X298
So, I'll be seeing you a few more times if you come in every year.  Um okay so PATIENT I looked at the chart.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
So that I'll tell you what I know so far.  Uh I see you have hypertension and you have some high sugars; otherwise you're doing fine basically.  Your weight is a little; you're overweight so I think we're working on the weight.  Um yeah so that's all I know so far.

PATIENT X298
Well this I got from my foot doctor okay.  Every, I don't know four, five, six months I get a little flare-up on the gout.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
And I'm going down to Florida.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
In another couple of months but I don't want to go down without my medicine.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
So I went to her to get the prescription renewed.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
Just so when I get down there I don't have to hunt around for a doctor if I have a flare.

DOCTOR X298
Okay sure.

PATIENT X298
And you know try and get the medicine and uh right off she told me to give this to my doc when I go there for my physical and I don't know what, I didn't read it.

DOCTOR X298
Oh so this is the lab.

PATIENT X298
This uh.

DOCTOR X298
It's uh January.

PATIENT X298
7 uh yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Recent lab.

PATIENT X298
Yeah I just went in January.

DOCTOR X298
Okay so that's, okay.

PATIENT X298
Anyway and then last time I was here.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
They said my blood pressure was a little bit high so they give me one of these light sort of things and they said to keep track of it.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
Okay so this morning when I took it, it was 125/68.

DOCTOR X298
Oh great, you have book here?

PATIENT X298
Oh yeah I got a plan.

DOCTOR X298
Awesome thank you.

PATIENT X298
It's high and then it goes low and then they put me on different pills and that doesn't work.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah it's generally high I would say.  You decided not to take it too much?

PATIENT X298
No I been taking the same thing.  They keep giving me different pills to take.

DOCTOR X298
What pill are you taking right now?

PATIENT X298
I'm taking three of them.

DOCTOR X298
Okay let me ask which ones.

PATIENT X298
Well lisinopril here I'll find them.

DOCTOR X298
Lisinopril 20 mg?

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Every day?

PATIENT X298
Every day I take all three of them in the morning.

DOCTOR X298
And then you take thiazide 25 mg.

PATIENT X298
Uh yep.

DOCTOR X298
Okay and amlodipine 10 mg.

PATIENT X298
Yeah I cut the pill in half.  That one I cut in half.  The 25 uh.

DOCTOR X298
The @@@ you cut it in half right?

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  So your blood pressure is still high a little bit today so.

PATIENT X298
Yeah but it'll go high just driving over here thinking about coming to this place.

DOCTOR X298
I know, I know.  So what I am going to do is I'm going to check on my own and check another one.

PATIENT X298
Let me ask you something.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.

PATIENT X298
Instead of keep, see every doctor I used to get, see I come back here once a year for my physical so every new doctor I get wants to change things.

DOCTOR X298
Right.

PATIENT X298
Now the first time I went here, when I go back to 2006 when I first started coming here.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
My blood pressure's just a little bit high.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
I got one pill, works fine and I come in the next year, I got a new doctor, now he says well let's try this, well let's try that, let's tweak this, let's tweak that.  Now he's got me taking two pills.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
The next year I come in, now he's got me taking three pills.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.

PATIENT X298
You know, I don't understand what the hell is going on here to be honest with you.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
So like I say everybody wants to change everything.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
You know the old concern if it ain't broke don't fix it.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
Why did they begin changing my medicine to begin with?

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  So, it's not because they want to change them or anything.  If they don't need to change them I think they won't change.  So basically your blood pressure when you come in.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
It's uncontrolled.

PATIENT X298
Right.

DOCTOR X298
So what that means um and although we add all the medication your blood pressure is not controlled.  So that means your blood pressure has worsened.  Though I think it's in the same range, we're adding the medication and you're still high, that means it's worsening.  That's why they added.

PATIENT X298
My blood pressure gets high just looking for a place to park out here.

DOCTOR X298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X298
I'm serious.  I mean it's just.  You drive around trying to find a place to park and you can't find a place to park.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah and then you get angry @@@.

PATIENT X298
You know and I say xxx Christ.

DOCTOR X298
I know what you're saying.

PATIENT X298
That's uh, I don't know I guess.

DOCTOR X298
I know what you're saying sir.  Okay.

PATIENT X298
Well I guess what I'm asking can they condense everything into one pill?

DOCTOR X298
No.

PATIENT X298
No.

DOCTOR X298
They got you on good medications.  If we can do that, we like to do that.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
But no, that's not possible.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
There are some combination pills.  Like @@@.  There's a combination pill that will have both of them.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
But if you're on a good dose, um you need to take three pills and it's not until you get a @@@ dose that we know that this is the right dose.  We can't titrate it if it's a combination pill, so we can't go up on one and we can't go up on one so usually we like to use um like single dose, single medication pills.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Until we get a good control okay.  And then what I'm seeing right now is that if.

PATIENT X298
See I can go home and I can do it in another couple hours and take my own blood pressure with the.

DOCTOR X298
Right.

PATIENT X298
Machine they gave me and it'd be normal.

DOCTOR X298
Do you the normal range of the blood pressure?

PATIENT X298
Yeah they tell me they wanted to keep it down around 140 or below.

DOCTOR X298
Right.

PATIENT X298
It’s those I get when I'm at home.

DOCTOR X298
Well okay, so today your blood pressure initially when we checked was 156 alright and then it came down to 148 when we took again.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
So I'm going to take it again.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
It's probably high now.

DOCTOR X298
Let me see.

PATIENT X298
Let me take off my shirt.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  Do you exercise?  

PATIENT X298
Do I exercise?  Not really.

DOCTOR X298
Not really.  So exercise.

PATIENT X298
This morning I was out shoveling.

DOCTOR X298
Exercises are good for blood pressure.

PATIENT X298
I take a walk every day.  So I walk down, I get my.

DOCTOR X298
About how long do you walk?

PATIENT X298
20 minutes maybe.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah that's good.  Every morning?

PATIENT X298
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Oh that's good.

PATIENT X298
I walk down and get the paper and oh I still work part-time on and off.

DOCTOR X298
So if you could put your arms here good.  Just relax.  It is 140/65, a little better.

PATIENT X298
Going down.

DOCTOR X298
Yes sir.

PATIENT X298
@@@.

DOCTOR X298
So.

PATIENT X298
I just gotta calm myself down.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah, try to calm down.  Part of it could be diet and then you exercise 20 minutes a day.

PATIENT X298
Yeah like I say I go out for a walk every morning.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  So and who do you live with?

PATIENT X298
Pardon?

DOCTOR X298
Who do you live with?

PATIENT X298
My son.

DOCTOR X298
Your son and uh do you have any family members who have had significant medical problems before?

PATIENT X298
No.

DOCTOR X298
Stroke, early heart attack, cancer?  Good and you have no allergies to medications?

PATIENT X298
Nope.

DOCTOR X298
And these three are the only medications you're taking right now?

PATIENT X298
That's it.  The only other one, like I say if I get a little flare-up of the gout.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
I take the.

DOCTOR X298
When did you get the flare-up last time?

PATIENT X298
Oh it's been a few months.  It's uh probably been four or five months.

DOCTOR X298
Okay and uh.

PATIENT X298
Like I say, you know I could go along.

DOCTOR X298
Where do you get the pain?

PATIENT X298
On the gout?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.

PATIENT X298
Usually around my ankle you know.  I did get it once in my elbow.

DOCTOR X298
The ankle or elbow okay and then how many times of flare-ups did you have so far in your life?

PATIENT X298
In my life since I've, oh I don't know.

DOCTOR X298
A lot?

PATIENT X298
No, no.  Like I say.

DOCTOR X298
More than 10?

PATIENT X298
No.

DOCTOR X298
About 5?

PATIENT X298
Yeah probably around five.

DOCTOR X298
Okay and uh for the last approximately one year, how many times did you have a flare-up?

PATIENT X298
Last year, I'd say once.

DOCTOR X298
Once okay alright.

PATIENT X298
Like I say and the only reason, I don't know again but I have a bottle with me.  I don't know what, she wrote down what I got on here.

DOCTOR X298
Uh-huh, okay.

PATIENT X298
Uh.  I don't know if she wrote it down there, wouldn't know if I seen it anyway.  But it's a little blue-greenish pills.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
You know and like I say, if I get it right away, if I feel it coming and I get it right away.

DOCTOR X298
It goes uh, goes away.

PATIENT X298
I take a couple of these pills.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.

PATIENT X298
Before I go to bed or during the day.

DOCTOR X298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X298
Then I take a couple you know.  I take maybe four of them.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
And it's usually gone overnight.

DOCTOR X298
And uh when you took the blood pressure today, did you eat this morning, you didn't eat yet this morning?

PATIENT X298
I haven't eaten nothing since last night.  They told me to fast.

DOCTOR X298
Okay thank you so much.  So for the next time when you come um you can fast and then before you see me.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
You can get labs that's fine.

PATIENT X298
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X298
I need the blood pressure readings okay.

PATIENT X298
Yeah they said I needed blood so don't eat nothing after midnight.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.

PATIENT X298
So.

DOCTOR X298
So that's, you know I'm sorry about that.  We have to do that when we do your cholesterol level.

PATIENT X298
Oh that's no big deal.

DOCTOR X298
But um you can eat lunch before you leave okay.

PATIENT X298
Alright.

DOCTOR X298
After we do blood tests.  So it's just a little blood test, it's not @@@.  Okay um and that's, that.  Your lipid levels look fine.  You're not taking any medication and this level is very good. Um your sugar is a little on the high side, that will cause diabetes okay.

PATIENT X298
How high is high?

DOCTOR X298
So your sugar is, you didn't eat anything and your sugar was 125, blood sugar.

PATIENT X298
What's normal?

DOCTOR X298
So normal if you're fasting I would see around under 100.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
So that means you have a little bit of resistance to the insulin that you give for the sugar so that means that I would say pre-diabetic.  So if you continue to be, continue this lifestyle or to continue the same foods, uh soon you'll become diabetic.  So as your primary care doctor I would like prevent that.

PATIENT X298
So what do you got to do, lay off the sweets?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah definitely.  So no sweets um pop, do you drink a lot of pop?

PATIENT X298
No I don't drink pop.

DOCTOR X298
How about cola or coke?

PATIENT X298
No.  I don't drink much pop.  Well once in a great while I'll have a pop.  Mostly, I've been drinking a little of that flavored water.

DOCTOR X298
Oh okay.

PATIENT X298
I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR X298
Okay that sounds good, that's not too bad.

PATIENT X298
Uh.

DOCTOR X298
Um but do you?

PATIENT X298
Once in a while Gatorade.

DOCTOR X298
Gatorade um, just once in a while is fine um.  Do you eat a lot of sweet stuff like um I don't know cookies or?

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
So that's definitely something you cut down on.  If you can do that, do you eat it every day?

PATIENT X298
No not every day.

DOCTOR X298
So once every few days?

PATIENT X298
Yeah you know once every few days I.

DOCTOR X298
Okay well if you could reduce that to once every week and uh what kind of foods do you have?  Do you eat a lot of meats and stuff or?

PATIENT X298
Well yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Hamburgers?

PATIENT X298
Hamburger.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah, so if you could stop, I mean reduce the, I don't think you can stop it but if you can reduce the amounts maybe you can eat some fish for a change, eat some more vegetables, eat some more fruit, those kinds of diet is something you want to follow.

PATIENT X298
No candy huh?

DOCTOR X298
No candy, no candy, no candy and then.

PATIENT X298
How about peanuts or something like that or?

DOCTOR X298
Peanuts are good but um, if you eat too much peanuts, they're very salty.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
And that raises your blood pressure.  You have two things, you have to eat for cheaper salt and you have to watch out for sugar.  So the salty stuff is like potato chips, um if you eat chips with hamburgers.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Hamburgers can have a lot of salt in there um, uh let's see, let's see, what else do you eat, I can't think of the salty stuff.

PATIENT X298
Uh I don't know.  I do put salt on some stuff.  I don't put a lot but just enough to flavor it a little bit.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.  So don't put salt.

PATIENT X298
Don't put salt.

DOCTOR X298
Or just put a little bit.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Because that kind of thing can make your blood pressure @@@ definitely.

PATIENT X298
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR X298
Okay and what I see from the blood test is I'd say you're pre-diabetic.  You're not diabetic but your.

PATIENT X298
I'm borderline?

DOCTOR X298
Borderline, you're borderline.  You're getting to it.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
And we want to prevent that and uh your kidney function has been a little higher than normal person.  Did you know that?

PATIENT X298
Yeah well @@@.

DOCTOR X298
Something called creatinine; we measure it to see your kidney functions.

PATIENT X298
Through my blood?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah through your blood.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
And that's been a little high but and it @@@.  That's most likely caused by hypertension in your case.  Usually the two major things that cause kidney issues.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
Is hypertension and diabetes okay and in your case you're not diabetic.  A lot of diabetes people they go onto dialysis, you know that right?

PATIENT X298
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X298
So initially we start seeing like a mild elevation of the kidney function, that's the first sign that we're injuring the kidneys and you're having that sign.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
Okay and then the next thing you see is that you start leak some protein from the kidney and those are the bad signs that your kidney's not doing well.  Um your urine test you had today actually showed a little bit of protein so this is not good as well.  So but those things all come down to the um the same things, is good don't be diabetic and have your blood pressure in good control so that's the main kinds of treatment.

PATIENT X298
Alright.

DOCTOR X298
So that's why we were worried about your blood pressure.  If the blood pressure runs high all the time that can injury your kidney okay.

PATIENT X298
Okay.  So in other words now, I'm still on the same medication right?

DOCTOR X298
You're still on the same medications but I would say um, so keep away from salt definitely because that will raise your um blood pressure.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
And as I said exercise helps.  So if you're walking 20 minutes that's great.  We need to have you do 30 minutes a day um, yeah I think those things would help and then if you're stressed out, as you said the blood pressure can rise.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
So stay away from stressors and uh have a good sleep, have a good sleep and good cycle of your life.

PATIENT X298
Good health.

DOCTOR X298
So I'd say, I recommend that.  Um your blood pressure is borderline high so if I see it, I would like to have it lower than this.  Uh normal range would be 140 and uh 140 is the systolic and the 90 is the diastolic but for people who are having some kidney issues, I would like to have it a little more lower.  So in your case I would like to aim a little lower.  So if I, I didn't know that you were upset about getting all the medication increased.

PATIENT X298
Oh know I was just curious because as I say every time I come in.

DOCTOR X298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X298
I have a different doctor and he'd want to say well let's tweak this or let's tweak that and.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.

PATIENT X298
You know and I think well shit now I started out on one pill, now I'm on three pills.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah, that's not because they want to tweak it, it's because it's getting worse okay.  So we have to do something for that.  Let's see.  So the thiazide, I think we can go up.  So you're taking only half a pill of the thiazide right?

PATIENT X298
The little orange one?

DOCTOR X298
The orange one yeah.

PATIENT X298
Yeah I tell you that's the one I'm cutting in half.  Yeah I take a half a pill.

DOCTOR X298
So let's see, amlodipine you're maxed out.  Lisinopril you're not maxed out.  So we can either increase this one or this one.  Uh I think since you're cutting the pill in half, you can just take that whole pill every day.

PATIENT X298
Just take the whole pill of it.

DOCTOR X298
A whole pill every day and then since you're telling me that your blood pressure is high when you come into the hospital, I would like to have it checked for the next two weeks if you don't mind and could you come to the hospital to see my nurse so that we can recheck your blood pressure?

PATIENT X298
It'll be high.

DOCTOR X298
Oh you think it'll be high?

PATIENT X298
Just coming over here yeah, I start thinking about it and uh.

DOCTOR X298
Or you know you can check at home for two weeks and then show me the records that you have two weeks and we won't check here.

PATIENT X298
Alright, well like I say it's uh.  I don't care if they check it here and every time I come in here it's, like I say I checked it this morning and it was 126.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah because I see here, I see that you've been running high for me too.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Right so probably if we take the average you're on the high side.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
So check it at home.  So I think that we will increase the medication if you don't mind.

PATIENT X298
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  

PATIENT X298
Whatever.

DOCTOR X298
Alright so, so uh let's see.  I think we can definitely increase this one and then I'm thinking of increasing this one was well.

PATIENT X298
Which one is that?

DOCTOR X298
The lisinopril.

PATIENT X298
The lisinopril okay.

DOCTOR X298
So you can go up to 80 mg of lisinopril and then you can go up to 25 mg on the thiazide those are all maximum dose.  So and then um let's see and then you can come and see us in a month.

PATIENT X298
Alright.

DOCTOR X298
Is that okay?

PATIENT X298
Yes.

DOCTOR X298
And uh you can, I don't know, you don't have to see me necessarily so you can just write in your blood pressure and you can come to see my nurse and then you can hand in the log that you have.

PATIENT X298
Yeah, well this one's full so, I'll have to keep checking on it.

DOCTOR X298
Right, usually do it for a time.

PATIENT X298
Alright.

DOCTOR X298
So if you could give us a copy so that we can um uh, we can leave it in the hospital, one sheet of paper at the hospital that'd be.

PATIENT X298
Yeah okay yeah.

DOCTOR X298
That'd be easier for us.

PATIENT X298
Keep a copy of it.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah just in case so that we can, if I get that paper, I'll just put that into the computer so we can know where the blood pressure is running.

PATIENT X298
Alright.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  So let's do that in one month.  Um and your blood pressure issue is okay and then the other thing I wanted to ask was, you had a flu shot, your shots are up-to-date.

PATIENT X298
Well I was gonna stop and get a flu shot on the way out of here.

DOCTOR X298
Oh yeah, you have that to do, you have a flu shot this year.  So you're going to get a flu shot today and then, how's your colonoscopy?  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X298
No.

DOCTOR X298
Oh never?  So how old are, you're 58.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
So probably you should have one.  Like everybody over 50 it is recommended.

PATIENT X298
Yeah I know and the last, you know I asked the doctor a couple years ago.  I had a little woman doctor.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
And she says you know I says I just don't really think about having one but she says you know if you get blood in your stool with a lot of blood or if it's black.

DOCTOR X298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X298
And it hasn't been black and I don't, I haven't had any blood in my stools so.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  So, but even if you don't have blood in your stools uh, everybody over 50 is recommended to do a scope.

PATIENT X298
Well I'm not really interested in having one right now.

DOCTOR X298
So the reason for this colonoscopy, colonoscopy is basically a camera.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
That goes in through the rectum.

PATIENT X298
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X298
Okay so they're going to give you some sedation.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
So that it won't be too painful.  The reason we do this is because you know that colon cancer is very prevalent in the United States, especially people who eat like American diets, high fatty foods and colon cancer, how it starts is like one small polyp, it starts with one small polyp and then as time goes, you know it grows, grows, grows and then it invades.  Invades, so if there's a colon here, it starts out like a tiny polyp.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
And then as time goes it grows, it grows okay and then it grows on this side too so instead of growing this side, there's a blood vessel coming into it.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
So usually when this thing reaches the point that it goes to the blood vessel, you're in trouble because there's a chance of going to the other places in the colon okay.  If you find out the polyp when it's this small, it's going to be a very simple surgery, you're already in the colon with the camera, you just put in some stuff that you can cut off the polyp so you can just cut off the polyp and that's it.  If you find it this big, okay.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
If you find it this big, it's too risky to go with the uh endoscopy procedure so in that case we need surgery.  What kind of surgery we do is that we resect the colon here to get a safe margin.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
If you find it in this stage, when it goes into the bloodstream and goes to the other organs, basically surgery won't cure this.  If it's in the other organ it's going to be chemotherapy and the prognosis is going to be very bad.  So, the reason behind this is that if we find colon cancer in the early stage, it's just staying as a polyp and it's not, it's gonna be a very simple procedure and you won't get recurrence.  If you find, if you find it later, if you find it more later the risk of doing a surgery or not even getting the surgery increases.  So that is the rationale of doing this colonoscopy in everybody over 50 years old.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
So we have a lot of patients that we just find a small polyp and we remove the polyp and every polyp that is removed is sent to the Pathology Lab.  They look in the microscope and they see if it's malignant or not and then there are polyps that we see, okay this has a potential to become malignant, it was great that we found it and we just removed it in a simple procedure and it's normal again.

PATIENT X298
I'll have to think about it.

DOCTOR X298
Okay so if you could think about and you could let me know and uh, um yeah and then I can just schedule it okay.  So that's about it.

PATIENT X298
Uh could I pick up these medicines, this prescription today?

DOCTOR X298
Sure, sure, sure.  You have, you're running out of all medications?

PATIENT X298
Nah, no, see I got them all at different times.

DOCTOR X298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X298
So one's going to run out before the other two.

DOCTOR X298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X298
And then the other one runs out and then.

DOCTOR X298
@@@.

PATIENT X298

DOCTOR X298

PATIENT X298

DOCTOR X298
Sure I can do that.  I'm going to give you like three or four refills so that you won't have to worry.

PATIENT X298
Uh I'll keep track, I'll keep track of my blood pressure.

DOCTOR X298
@@@.  Then have you ever talked about an Advanced Directive and stuff?

PATIENT X298
A what?

DOCTOR X298
Advanced Directive and a Power of Attorney?

PATIENT X298
Oh I got that through my kids and that yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Oh okay.  So you have the papers sent to the VA?

PATIENT X298
Do I have it done through the VA?  No.

DOCTOR X298
So you should read this, it's like authorization of what you want to do in case @@@.  

PATIENT X298
Uh.

DOCTOR X298
So you don't take any medication outside the VA?

PATIENT X298
No, like I say, the only thing I take is if I get a little flare-up of the gout.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
But other than that, no I don't take nothing.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
Other than an aspirin once in a while for a headache or something.

DOCTOR X298
Okay and then um so there's another screening, uh people over 65, have you ever smoked before?

PATIENT X298
Yeah I quit about 22 years ago.

DOCTOR X298
So have you ever had a screening of the ultrasound of the abdomen?

PATIENT X298
Yeah they did that, I think the last time I was in here.

DOCTOR X298
Okay, they did it last time?

PATIENT X298
Yeah, I remember they took a ultrasound of my stomach and that.

DOCTOR X298
Okay and that was normal?

PATIENT X298
As far as I know, they never said nothing.

DOCTOR X298
Okay, let's see.

PATIENT X298
I think it was last year.

DOCTOR X298
I'll just see it and I'm sure it's going to be uh for it so, oh there is uh okay, so you're good, you're done.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
Good.  

PATIENT X298
So no sugars huh, no sweets?

DOCTOR X298
No sweets, no salt.

PATIENT X298
And no salt.

DOCTOR X298
No salt.

PATIENT X298
Is pepper okay?

DOCTOR X298
There's the pneumonia vaccine if you want to do it.

PATIENT X298
I think I had that last time too.

DOCTOR X298
Last time too, okay, alrighty, that's good.  Okay so, I'll see you in six months is that okay?  Or is once a year fine with you?

PATIENT X298
No I think once a year is fine.  I come in to the VA, I spend the whole day here, I got other stuff to do.

DOCTOR X298
Okay, so @@@ started for you?

PATIENT X298
Did you want me to make an appointment for that blood pressure thing?

DOCTOR X298
Oh they're going to make that.

PATIENT X298
About a month you said.

DOCTOR X298
When you check out they're gonna make it.

PATIENT X298
Yeah I mean in about another month?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah about another month.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah and then at that time you have to bring the records of the blood pressure.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
Could you just sit down and I'll listen to your heart and stuff?

PATIENT X298
Oh.

DOCTOR X298
And I recommend keep working on your weight because losing your weight can help blood pressure be regular and also the sugar too.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
So that's all connected, everything is connected, your food, your lifestyle.

PATIENT X298
You're taking all the good things away from me though.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah I know so I have to do that, it's my job so. Deep breath, breathe out, once more, breathe out, that's good.  Okay so okay so I'll talk to my boss.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
And then I'll come back here okay.

(DOCTOR OUT: 96:10  DOCTOR IN:  106:24)

DOCTOR X298
Let me call the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X298
Do you want me to keep taking this other medicine till I run out that I got now?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah, I'll talk to you about that.  @@@.  (Doctor makes phone call)  Do you want to pick it up at the Pharmacy?

PATIENT X298
Yeah I'll pick it up as long as I'm here today.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.  (Doctor still on phone)  Okay, all the medications are done.

PATIENT X298
So you're saying no salt at all on anything or?

DOCTOR X298
@@@ no salt right?

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
If you can do no salt, I mean you put extra salt on the food?

PATIENT X298
Well like some places, just say Mcxxx's for instance, I know their fries they use a little packet of salt.

DOCTOR X298
They use a lot of salt.  They use a lot of salt.  

PATIENT X298
You know like I say if I order French fries or something, I'll put a little bit of salt on that or.

DOCTOR X298
No, no, no.

PATIENT X298
Oh.

DOCTOR X298
That's very bad.

PATIENT X298
That's bad.

DOCTOR X298
Yeah so that's very bad because they already have salt in there.

PATIENT X298
Alright.

DOCTOR X298
Then you're adding extra salt in it.

PATIENT X298
Okay.  No salt, no sugar.

DOCTOR X298
No salt, no sugar.

PATIENT X298
No sugar in the coffee or?

DOCTOR X298
It's possible, it's possible.  I would recommend getting used to no sugar.

PATIENT X298
No sugar and just milk or.  How about on cereal?

DOCTOR X298
On cereal, no, no, no, no.

PATIENT X298
No, no, no, no.  

DOCTOR X298
No salt or anything.

PATIENT X298
No sugar.

DOCTOR X298
No sugar, no sugar, no sugar.

PATIENT X298
No sugar. 

DOCTOR X298
So maybe you can work on that first, no sugar, no salt.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
And after a while you can think about decreasing because like I told you, everything down the line is going to be horrible if you have hypertension and diabetes.

PATIENT X298
What's hypertension?  Is that high blood pressure?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.  We see a lot of those cases like usually, it's like you, you're just like having high blood pressure.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Pre-diabetic and eventually when you end up in the hospital they have all the complications of diabetes so you can name everything and they have it, so if you have diabetes, you can lose your eyesight, can have dialysis because of the kidney problems.

PATIENT X298
Hmm.

DOCTOR X298
And then you have neuropathy so you don't feel anything in your legs or your hands and then sometimes that's painful and you get erectile dysfunction, you get difficulty in moving your GI tract after you eat and also because you don't have sensation, good sensation, you're at increased risk of infection and once you get an infection in the foot it's very difficult to treat.  When they go into the bone you have to amputate the foot.

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
So it's horrible, @@@.   So if you can stop here and prevent that from happening, that's gonna be, I think that'll be a great thing so.  So today.

PATIENT X298
Start eating fish though huh?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah.  Today, what I changed today is um uh, I said I'm going to go up on lisinopril too but it seems like the Pharmacy won't allow me to go up on the lisinopril.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
So I'm just going to increase the thiazide, the pill that you're cutting into half.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.  So I'll take one of those.

DOCTOR X298
Just start taking one of those and then the medication you want to pick up today is going to be the same pill.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
But um enough that you can take it every day.

PATIENT X298
Alright.

DOCTOR X298
Okay so like I gave you three refills and then you're going to come back in one month with your blood pressure log and if that is high I need to add another medication okay.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
Um and then for your gout there's a medication that can prevent gout from happening.

PATIENT X298
They gave me that once before here but it didn't work.

DOCTOR X298
Um.

PATIENT X298
This goes back a few years, maybe three, four years.

DOCTOR X298
Well maybe, yeah I'm not sure but sometimes it doesn't work.

PATIENT X298
Is it a pill you gotta take every day?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah because of treatment, you've done this before or even people who are taking, it doesn't happen.  Um but still it decreases the risk that we know, we know that it decreases the risk.

PATIENT X298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X298
Of happening so I think we'll just start that medication again.  We usually start in the lower dose and then we increase the dose as tolerated.  Um I'm going to check, I just added a uric acid level in your blood tests so that when the results come back and if it comes back and if it's high we'll increase the pills you're on.  This pill is only once a day, one tablet a day but you can increase to three pills a day if there's no issues.  Um so I'll let you know, I'll let you know about the results and uh I'll let you know if we're going to increase the medication or not but for now you can just take that one pill.

PATIENT X298
Well what happens if I get a flare-up of the gout, can I take this with the medicine that I'm taking?

DOCTOR X298
No this medication will prevent that, so if you get a flare-up this won't help.

PATIENT X298
So I could take the other pills that I've taken now for it?

DOCTOR X298
Yeah, yeah, the indomethacin.  Right, I probably, have you gotten indomethacin?

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
You can take that pain and if the pain is still uncontrolled you can call us and we'll give you other medications.

PATIENT X298
This is what I didn't want is all this medication for this and this cause I really don't understand how I had one pill you know, it's just you take a pill for this, a pill for this and a pill for this.

DOCTOR X298
So these three pills are for your blood pressure you know that right?

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
And what I'm adding is just one pill; it's for preventing from the gout from happening okay.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
Make sense?

PATIENT X298
I'll give it a try and see what happens.

DOCTOR X298
For now we'll see what happens okay.  So I'll see you in one year but um we're going to see you in Nursing in one month.

PATIENT X298
One month.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X298
Okay so you know how to check out right?

PATIENT X298
Yeah.

DOCTOR X298
Okay.

PATIENT X298
So I got to rid of this.

DOCTOR X298
Just give this to the check out.

PATIENT X298
Okay.

DOCTOR X298
Have a good day now.

PATIENT X298
You uh, now I can just go down to the Pharmacy and that stuff will be down in the Pharmacy?

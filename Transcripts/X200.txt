PATIENT X200

DOCTOR X200
Um vertigo gone yet?

PATIENT X200
Uh not too well.

DOCTOR X200
Oh oh.

PATIENT X200
And I took it.  @@@ I got some more coming up but, when I first used them, actually @@@.

DOCTOR X200
After you were done.

PATIENT X200
Yeah so @@@.  But I made it out to my car and fell flat on my face and I felt like a bird.  Thank God there was a guy there just parking.  He come running over and he figured I died or something.

DOCTOR X200
Yeah.

PATIENT X200
And he helped me up.

DOCTOR X200
How many times have you actually passed out since we last saw each other?

PATIENT X200
Just that once.

DOCTOR X200
Just that one time?  Okay.

PATIENT X200
Yeah.

DOCTOR X200
Because all the manipulations.

PATIENT X200
Yeah, yeah.  @@@ in the meantime my prescriptions filled.

DOCTOR X200
@@@.

PATIENT X200
And is there such a test, a test where I don't know how to say it, testosterone?

DOCTOR X200
Testosterone?

PATIENT X200
Yeah testosterone, what my level is?

DOCTOR X200
Yeah why do you uh?

PATIENT X200
Cause nothings working.

DOCTOR X200
Yeah.  Oh @@@.

PATIENT X200
@@@.

DOCTOR X200
How are uh things going you know?  I know that you were under a lot of stress and a lot of.

PATIENT X200
Yeah see my wife's doing much better now.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.

PATIENT X200
She still can't @@@ so I don't know, problems with her pain and what not but we're doing better than we were.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.

PATIENT X200
I went back to work thank God.  That took a little pressure off.

DOCTOR X200
Good.  Uh so nothing, have you seen the Urology doctor?

PATIENT X200
Yeah one time.

DOCTOR X200
One time you did?

PATIENT X200
Yeah a while back you sent me there.

DOCTOR X200
That's right and what did they say?

PATIENT X200
@@@.

DOCTOR X200
No @@@.  They just said to increase the Levitra to 20 mg but that's not doing anything for you?

PATIENT X200
No.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.  We might have something better, let me check.  How is your energy?

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
@@@.

PATIENT X200
Yeah.

DOCTOR X200
Your strength is okay?  Like your muscle strength?

PATIENT X200
Yeah.

DOCTOR X200
You don't feel weak or anything?

PATIENT X200
Uh uh, no.  @@@.

DOCTOR X200
What's that?

PATIENT X200
@@@ back.

DOCTOR X200
That's good.  They actually tested your testosterone levels back in January 2009 um and they were fairly normal.  It was normal.  I don't think that's the problem.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
I'm kind of out of things to do.  You know I've checked you for metabolic and @@@.  The only thing I can have you do is see the Urology doctors to see if there are any other options out there.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
@@@.

PATIENT X200
Any other pill that will work, Viagra or?

DOCTOR X200
Viagra, I don't know if I, they don't carry Viagra here but the medicine that, the Levitra is the same thing uh-huh. 

PATIENT X200
The same thing. 

DOCTOR X200
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
I wouldn't @@@.

PATIENT X200
Well I've never changed, whatever you were sending me or can't you go up, is that what we did?

DOCTOR X200
Now you're getting 20 mg.

PATIENT X200
Okay.  I think I was.  I had to stop taking it cause it wasn't doing anything.

DOCTOR X200
Sure.  Now you're taking that how soon before?

PATIENT X200
Half an hour or an hour whatever.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.  So you're doing that.

PATIENT X200
Yeah.

DOCTOR X200
I don't know, maybe we'll just have you talk with the Urology doctors again now that you're on the, you know tell them you're on the maximum dose of the Levitra and you haven't noticed any change.

PATIENT X200
Alright.

DOCTOR X200
Uh now you haven't had any headaches or anything like that, blurry vision, double vision?

PATIENT X200
Nope.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.  And your blood pressure, you've been off the lisinopril now correct?

PATIENT X200
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X200
Your blood pressure was not too bad here.

PATIENT X200
No I know it was 140 over.

DOCTOR X200
76 which is kind of high did you just walk in?

PATIENT X200
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X200
Yeah we'll recheck it here but I'm guessing that you could probably stay off the lisinopril.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
Uh well this appointment was made primarily to follow up with the vertigo to see how you've been doing with that.  Would you say it’s better?  Cause I remember last time you were getting frequent attacks so if you've only had one attack after the manipulation.

PATIENT X200
I have to watch everything.  Well especially when I'm in bed and try to get out of bed.

DOCTOR X200
Yeah.

PATIENT X200
That's when it happens.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.  We're going to give you a pill called meclizine that might help some of the symptoms.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
It's not going to eliminate it but it might help some of it.

PATIENT X200
Alright, I've learned by just taking things a little slower and I'm @@@ most of the time anyway but by slowing down a little bit I think it's helped and think before I move in bed.  But if I try to get up too quick I might as well lay on over on the floor.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.

PATIENT X200
Not out but down I mean I got, the other day I really, the first time I'd been sick to my stomach you know when the vertigo hit and it's been a long time since that's happened.  I didn't throw up but I was real close.

DOCTOR X200
Sure.  And you mentioned you've had an MRI and a MRA the last time.

PATIENT X200
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X200
Um you don't have those reports do you?

PATIENT X200
No.

DOCTOR X200
Maybe the next time we see each other just remember to bring those in.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
So I can get them into the VA System so we have records of them.

PATIENT X200
Fine.

DOCTOR X200
Let me put the notes in that we're going to try the meclizine.  It's not a medication that is common but you know it might have @@@.  Okay it's generally used for like motion sickness and things like that.

PATIENT X200
Yeah.

DOCTOR X200
But it's also used for vertigo.  It can cause you to be a little bit drowsy, that's probably the main side effect.

PATIENT X200
I'll be careful with it.

DOCTOR X200
We're going to start, we'll start with a low dose 25 mg um once a day and we're going to give you a 50 mg tablet and you can cut that in half.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
And see if that eliminates it.  Um if you notice that you're still getting a lot of vertigo, but maybe it's helping a little bit, you can take up to 100 mg a day.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
In divided doses so maybe do, you know if it's helping a little bit but um it's not away maybe you can increase it after about a week or so to 25 mg twice a day and try that.

PATIENT X200
Alright.

DOCTOR X200
Let's try it for a week with just the 25 mg.  If it's doing nothing then I don't know, like if it's making you drowsy then just stop it.

PATIENT X200
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X200
Yeah.  Okay.  Um and then everything else we kind of took care of the last visit.  

PATIENT X200
I am feeling a bit better, now that the pressure's off with my wife.

DOCTOR X200
@@@.

PATIENT X200
Stress really does affect you.  I know it was dragging me down.

DOCTOR X200
Yeah.

PATIENT X200
We're doing fine.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.

PATIENT X200
Alright.

DOCTOR X200
Let's get your blood pressure now.  @@@.  

PATIENT X200
Not bad @@@.

DOCTOR X200
@@@.

PATIENT X200
@@@ parking lot @@@.

DOCTOR X200
Oh.  Alright just rest your arm against me.  128/72.  @@@.  Your blood pressure is better than mine.  Deep breaths for me now.  @@@.  

PATIENT X200
No.

DOCTOR X200
Okay good.  Alright.  We're going to, we'll try the meclizine and hopefully that works for you.  When is your next appointment with Physical Therapy?

PATIENT X200
I think it's coming in another week.  @@@.

DOCTOR X200
Okay good, good.  I want you to see the Urology doctors.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
Um.

PATIENT X200
@@@.

DOCTOR X200
Just have a seat for just one second while I talk to my attending.

PATIENT X200
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  34:50  DOCTOR IN:  43:07)

DOCTOR X200
Alright so I talked with DOCTOR.  He said he was fine with the meclizine.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
But he's also recommending a couple other things.  Uh the omeprazole, the acid blocker that you're on.

PATIENT X200
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X200
Why was that started?

PATIENT X200
I have terrible reflux.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.  When was that started?

PATIENT X200
A long time ago.

DOCTOR X200
Have you ever tried going without it?

PATIENT X200
Yep.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.  Have you tried things like Zantac before?

PATIENT X200
No.

DOCTOR X200
Okay.  Omeprazole, if you've been on it for a while it can definitely contribute to some vertigo and dizziness and things like that.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
So it might be worth trying, you know trying you without it and then I'm going to check Zantac here um and then try the Zantac.  It's a similar, it's not a proton-pump inhibitor but it still blocks the acid production in your stomach.  We don't have Zantac here but you can get it over-the-counter.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
Um so stop the omeprazole; try taking the Zantac and see if that makes any difference.  Obviously if your acid reflux becomes severe and you don't notice any difference in the.

PATIENT X200
@@@.

DOCTOR X200
Yeah then switch back to the omeprazole.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
Lastly, you know he, even though you just had a MRI, you know we don't have any head imaging here so he was hoping that we could get a CAT scan of your @@@.  Um it's a CT scan so you know you're in and out, it doesn't take that long.  Just to make sure, especially with your history of head and neck cancer.

PATIENT X200
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X200
The likelihood of this being anything is hardly something but we're just being more conservative.

PATIENT X200
Sure.

DOCTOR X200
Well, I'm going to, are you able to get that done?

PATIENT X200
Yeah.

DOCTOR X200
Okay I'll order it then.  So definitely stay off the it's always good when you're getting rid of medications.

PATIENT X200
Yeah exactly.

DOCTOR X200
So stay off the lisinopril, looks like your blood pressure doesn't need any more help.

PATIENT X200
@@@.

DOCTOR X200
Good and then um we'll try you off the omeprazole.

PATIENT X200
The Zantac you take it just once a day or?

DOCTOR X200
Yeah just once a day.  Then we'll send you back to the Urology doctor okay?  Unfortunately I don't have any other, I mean there are some other drugs that they're more familiar with and they can check on that and then hopefully things will go well.  Oh there was one more thing that I want, he was also saying uh for, to get you know what's causing the bad erectile dysfunction and what's causing this extreme vertigo.

PATIENT X200
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X200
There are two main systems in the body.  The symphysis and parasymphysis, it's kind of like the sympathetic @@@ it slows down the metabolic processes so sometimes you might have a malfunction of those two systems um and that could explain the vertigo.  It can also explain the erectile dysfunction and how you test for that is something called autonomic testing uh which um they just do various tests like if you're going to be on a table and then ask you to get up and down.  It is a pretty extensive test.  They normally last about an hour, so it might get us some information that there's an impairment in the autonomic system.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
And then if there is, the Neurology doctor would do something similar.  I think it'd be worth getting that done too.  So a CT of the head, autonomic testing, stop the omeprazole, try the Zantac and have @@@.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
All of your medicines are renewed.  I don't have to see you back for another four months or so okay.

PATIENT X200
Okay.

DOCTOR X200
I'll let you know if something comes up before then.

PATIENT X200
Great.

DOCTOR X200
@@@ take care of yourself.

PATIENT X200
Yeah.

PATIENT LEAVES 49:06.

Time is 9:08.

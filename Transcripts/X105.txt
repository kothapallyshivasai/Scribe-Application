DOCTOR X105
PATIENT?

PATIENT X105
Yeah hi.  Hi how you doing?

DOCTOR X105
Right on time huh.

PATIENT X105
Right on time, right on the button.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah, just give me a minute.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
How you doing?

PATIENT X105
Good.

DOCTOR X105
So when was the last time I saw you, do you remember?

PATIENT X105
No I don't remember any of that.

DOCTOR X105
It's been a while?

PATIENT X105
Uh been a while yeah.  I was thinking like six months.

DOCTOR X105
Almost yeah, June.

PATIENT X105
June, wow that long.

DOCTOR X105
What can I do for you?

PATIENT X105
Uh I'm in for a regular check-up I guess.

DOCTOR X105
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X105
Uh I wanted to tell you that on the pills, that last pill that I was taking, that varmazine or what it is.

DOCTOR X105
Hmm, it's call valsartan.

PATIENT X105
Valsartan, whatever that is.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
I never could get enough of those.  I'd always run out so consequently what I did is I switched back to taking only one pill.  So I've only taken one pill instead of the pill and a half.

DOCTOR X105
Let me look @@@.  How much were you taking before?

PATIENT X105
Before I was taking one pill and then you bumped it up to a pill and a half.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
And I took it for a while, then I couldn't get the dag gone pills and uh so I just switched back to spread them out to one pill.  But here's a listing of my blood pressures I took.

DOCTOR X105
This is on one pill.

PATIENT X105
This is all on one pill.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah there's a couple of high ones.

PATIENT X105
If you say so I'll go back to a pill and a half.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.  Cause I want it at 140 or below.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
You have a couple that uh 126, 140, so you didn't have enough huh?

PATIENT X105
Yeah, I keep running out and I am.

DOCTOR X105
How many days behind were you?  Uh how many days could you.

PATIENT X105
I think for a period there I was out of pills for about two weeks.

DOCTOR X105
Really.  If it's at 1 1/2 really.

PATIENT X105
1 1/2, so I spread it out to one pill and then I started using what I had, I went back to one pill and then since then I haven't changed it.  I just kept going with it.  @@@.  But if you're thinking the blood pressure's still too high and you want it down, I can, I got pills now but I wanted to tell you.  If they're going to get them to me, they got to give me more than what they've been sending.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.  They'll have to do that.  Cause I'm thinking you have a 90 day supply.

PATIENT X105
Yeah, if they want me on a pill and a half they're going to have to kick up the number by 50%.

DOCTOR X105
I can't do math, alright.  You need 90 pills, so 90 pills will give one pill for three months.  If you also need a half.

PATIENT X105
Yeah.

DOCTOR X105
Half a tablet for, so it would be a half tablet x3 x30.

PATIENT X105
If it would be 90 for three months then a pill and a half would be then another 45 wouldn't it?

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.  It works out to be 135 pills.  Should be enough wouldn't it?

PATIENT X105
I don't know, I been taking them uh.  I might have some left cause the problem I had is its feast or famine.  Either I have no pills or all of a sudden I got a bunch of them.  I got enough now, I got in that bottle, I think that would last me a little bit.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
But uh how long, what I really have to be able to do is uh, when I run out, before I run out I figure about a week or so and then I turn in my prescription for that.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
And then I get them on time.

DOCTOR X105
How active are you right now?

PATIENT X105
I'm very active.

DOCTOR X105
Are you, so do you exercise at all?

PATIENT X105
Oh yeah, every morning.

DOCTOR X105
What do you think you do?

PATIENT X105
I do about 20 minutes.  I got uh.

DOCTOR X105
Do you walk?

PATIENT X105
I walk but I got a regimen of uh exercises that I do.  They take about 25 minutes.

DOCTOR X105
What kind of exercises?

PATIENT X105
Mostly stretching.  Stretching and just limbering up.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
And then I walk the dog, I walk her every day, about at least two, a couple of blocks.  But I'm active.  I'm putting brakes in the car right now.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
And so I'm up and down you know.

DOCTOR X105
Any problems at all or anything else?  Anything that's concerning you?

PATIENT X105
Uh nothing except what I wanted to ask you.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
When I sleep at night.

DOCTOR X105
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X105
You know I've been taking guitar lessons.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
So when I take guitar lessons it's hard on your fingers.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
It really hurts like hell, so anyway as I been sleeping at night, when I lay on my belly I feel tingling in my hand here.

DOCTOR X105
Hmm.

PATIENT X105
And I keep thinking that tingling is coming from pressing on the.

DOCTOR X105
@@@.  Sometimes you can injure your carpal tunnel down here.

PATIENT X105
Yeah.  I don't know but anyway.  I do, I do feel that tingling and then it goes away if I roll over and I get on my back it seems to disappear but then it'll come back again and it's like a tingling situation and I keep thinking it's coming from those fingers but I thought I'd pass it by you to see what you thought.

DOCTOR X105
Where's the tingling?

PATIENT X105
It just goes up my arm right here?

DOCTOR X105
Anywhere and do your fingers tingle at all?

PATIENT X105
Yeah.

DOCTOR X105
Which fingers?

PATIENT X105
All of them, they just.

DOCTOR X105
Any fingers worse than the others?

PATIENT X105
Yeah these are the ones that I use for the cords.

DOCTOR X105
The three here.  

PATIENT X105
You're supposed to use four for the cord but I don't use that pinky much.

DOCTOR X105
How bad is it?

PATIENT X105
No it's just very mild.

DOCTOR X105
And it goes away if you.

PATIENT X105
Yeah it goes away, yeah it isn't, it's not enough to wake you up or anything it's just a little.  It's irritating.  Like you, have you ever slept on your arm?

DOCTOR X105
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X105
You sleep on your arm and you get up and you feel a little tingling.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
That's it.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.  How's your knee doing?

PATIENT X105
Knee is okay and I had a question on that.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
There's a newspaper ad that says they got a new concoction a pill that lubricates the joints and it does it within a week and I didn't, I saved that article but I wanted to ask there, is there a pill on the market that is good for the joints that I might be taking?

DOCTOR X105
Well there's some controversy.  A lot of the pills @@@ have like glucosamine or chondroitin.

PATIENT X105
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X105
Have you tried using those in the past before?

PATIENT X105
No.

DOCTOR X105
So they have those over-the-counter.  Some studies show that it helps; some studies show that it doesn't so I can't say for sure.  It's supposed to like help lubricate your joints, help @@@.

PATIENT X105
They say take gelatin.  Is that Jell-O, is Jell-O gelatin?

DOCTOR X105
Yeah, Jell-O is a gelatin.

PATIENT X105
If you eat a lot of Jell-O would that help?

DOCTOR X105
Uh.  @@@.  Typically they'll have chondroitin, glucosamine and gelatin.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
And some studies show it helps, some studies show it doesn't so I can't, you know.  I don't know if it helps or not.  It can be expensive.  And @@@ bottle costs like $20-$30 for a bottle.

PATIENT X105
That kills it right there.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah and some people say it helps and some people say it doesn't.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
So I don't know if it really @@@.

PATIENT X105
Well my, as long as I keep active and I keep my knee.  When it gets damp out.

DOCTOR X105
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X105
I've got a support that they gave me.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
A knee support and I put that on and it's the heat from that that seems to help the most and as long as I do that I can get through day @@@.

DOCTOR X105
Do you smoke at all?

PATIENT X105
No.

DOCTOR X105
Ever smoke before?

PATIENT X105
I smoked uh when I was first in the service maybe oh, I might have been maybe about 25 years old so it's been a long time since I.  But I never smoked cigarettes.  I smoked a pipe.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
And I smoked cigars, then cigars got too expensive.  A good cigar ran about 75 cents.

DOCTOR X105
You live pretty far from here don't you?

PATIENT X105
Yeah xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X105
What if I want you, I need you to come back to get lab work done.  When's your next appointment here do you know?

PATIENT X105
I have no idea.  Well wait a minute I got one with uh an eye doctor.

DOCTOR X105
Do you know when that is?

PATIENT X105
Uh seemed to me that's coming up.  If you could break into that you might be able to check it.

DOCTOR X105
This doesn't list any other appointments other than @@@.

PATIENT X105
No I can't tell you because I don't remember because I complained I'm having trouble reading and they told me last time I was there in three months they were gonna have me in for cataract surgery and I never heard from them again.  So I asked them what the heck was happening and they said well you got an appointment coming up within a month or two.

DOCTOR X105
@@@.

PATIENT X105
And so I said well I'll just wait for that.

DOCTOR X105
When was the last time you saw them?

PATIENT X105
Oh God I wish you wouldn't ask me these questions.  Uh I should keep a record on that but it's been a while.

DOCTOR X105
August.

PATIENT X105
August, that long wow.

DOCTOR X105
You say you just stopped by on your way out of here and scheduled an appointment with them.

PATIENT X105
I got one.  I don't know when it is though.

DOCTOR X105
@@@.

PATIENT X105
They told me I had one.

DOCTOR X105
It's not listed in here.  You can stop by the Eye Clinic on the way out.

PATIENT X105
I will.  They told me I had one coming up.

DOCTOR X105
And you saw the skin doctor right?

PATIENT X105
Yeah I just saw them.

DOCTOR X105
Not too long ago.

PATIENT X105
Yeah.

DOCTOR X105
And they took a biopsy alright.

PATIENT X105
Yeah they took a biopsy on my nose right and that was clear.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
But I have trouble with my eyes cause they water a lot and I keep thinking its, they say when you're having trouble reading that's the time you should get these things removed and uh they said it wasn't the right time.

DOCTOR X105
Back in August they wanted you to come back in about 9-12 months.

PATIENT X105
Yeah.

DOCTOR X105
It should be around now from this summer.

PATIENT X105
Yeah.

DOCTOR X105
Just stop by on the way out of here.

PATIENT X105
Yeah, okay I'll double check.  If you could then we could make that appointment at the same time.

DOCTOR X105
Yep.  Just have a seat up here.  Is it a big hassle for you to come up here?

PATIENT X105
What's that?

DOCTOR X105
Is it a big hassle for you to come to the VA?

PATIENT X105
No not if it's necessary no.  I come here, but I like to double up on appointments if I can.  You know it takes me an hour to get here.

DOCTOR X105
Where did they do the biopsy?

PATIENT X105
Right there on the nose, right about there.

DOCTOR X105
The nose okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X105
They did find some stuff before.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah I saw that yeah.

PATIENT X105
And then they did uh, they did some cutting.

DOCTOR X105
Open your mouth, say ah.

PATIENT X105
Ah.

DOCTOR X105
Okay, yeah I saw their note.  Yeah they did a little bit huh.

PATIENT X105
Yeah and they were concerned because they did remove some before that was cancerous.

DOCTOR X105
Deep breath in and out.  I'll have you lie back here.  No chest pain or shortness of breath?

PATIENT X105
Nope.

DOCTOR X105
Or stomach pain?

PATIENT X105
Nope.  Those pills were uh, were uh I call them antacids.

DOCTOR X105
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X105
They work great.

DOCTOR X105
Okay that's good.  Any pain at all?

PATIENT X105
Nope.  

DOCTOR X105
You need to sit back up here.  Who do you live with?

PATIENT X105
I live alone.  I got a dog, me and the dog.

DOCTOR X105
@@@.

PATIENT X105
My wife died about 20 years ago.

DOCTOR X105
Oh wow.

PATIENT X105
So and I have @@@.  My kids are all gone.

DOCTOR X105
Do they have okay health?

PATIENT X105
Yeah.  My dog wasn't feeling too good.  I think she's got epilepsy.

DOCTOR X105
Really, that's not @@@.

PATIENT X105
I see that she fell over and she had went into like a fit.

DOCTOR X105
Yeah.

PATIENT X105
And in about three minutes it was over so I got some dog books from the library and they said yeah that breed can have epilepsy.

DOCTOR X105
@@@.

PATIENT X105
And uh I said well at 10 years old you know, maybe she's to that point where she can't.

DOCTOR X105
@@@.

PATIENT X105
Yeah she's getting pretty old.

DOCTOR X105
Let me talk to my attending I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X105
Sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  119:2  DOCTOR IN:  123:02)

DOCTOR X105
Alright, so we'll just change it back to the 1 1/2 I hope they send you enough this time.  They may have miscounted.

PATIENT X105
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X105
Let me renew actually all of your regular meds have been renewed except for the valsartan.  Okay I'll renew the valsartan.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
And um.

PATIENT X105
It seemed like there was a limit on the number of valsartan I could get and I would run they would tell me that there's no more available.  Is all that heart medicine, is that all the same as rat poison?

DOCTOR X105
No why would you say that?

PATIENT X105
I heard that.  Heart medicine is usually rat poison.

DOCTOR X105
(Laughter) I don't know where you heard that um.  Okay so what we will do I'll have you come back here in about six months.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
Um unless something major goes on.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
Then you need to come back sooner than that.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
I want to check lab work at the beginning of like, I should probably have you come back to see the nurse to make sure your blood pressure is okay.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
Okay for a nurse appointment.

PATIENT X105
Okay.  Well can you call the Eye Clinic to find out if I have an appointment that they don't show on the books?

DOCTOR X105
There's nothing in there so what you need to do is on your way down, just walk on in.

PATIENT X105
I know but then it can help you right now.

DOCTOR X105
For the.

PATIENT X105
To make another appointment.

DOCTOR X105
We'll see how your blood pressure is though.  I don't think you need to see the nurse.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
Cause you can check your blood pressure at home.

PATIENT X105
Yeah.

DOCTOR X105
So if there is any @@@ in your blood pressure and if it gets higher then when you take 1 1/2 a day if you see it getting any higher than 145.

PATIENT X105
Yeah.

DOCTOR X105
Call in here, let the nurse know and they'll just let me know.

PATIENT X105
I hear you.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
Okay I'll do that.  Cause it sure seems like it isn't bad.  You know it gets down to 132 something and that's pretty good.

DOCTOR X105
It's just less than, but I think that over 145 a lot.

PATIENT X105
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.  Well I would like the lab work in like 1-2 weeks or so, whenever you go to get your eye appointment.

PATIENT X105
When I come in to the eye appointment can I automatically go down and get my blood and then.

DOCTOR X105
Just tell them that your doctor ordered the lab work.

PATIENT X105
Great.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
That'll take care of it.

DOCTOR X105
But I would like to get it done within the next month or so.

PATIENT X105
Okay cause right now I'm without a car.  My car has bad brakes and we're working on it and uh so now I got a driver driving me in.

DOCTOR X105
Okay.

PATIENT X105
And I think I just lost a friend, I don't think he'll drive me down again.

DOCTOR X105
And now I need to have you come back in about six months.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
Um so I'm finishing up in the program in June.

PATIENT X105
Oh bummer, that's great for you.

DOCTOR X105
So when you come back you'll probably be with a different resident.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
Um I'm actually staying around, I'll be in Cardiology.

PATIENT X105
Okay.

DOCTOR X105
So I'll be around it just won't be here.

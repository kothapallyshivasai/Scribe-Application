DOCTOR X605
PATIENT? 

PATIENT X605
Pardon?

DOCTOR X605
How you doing today?

PATIENT X605
Pretty good and yourself?

DOCTOR X605
I'm good.  I'm DOCTOR, I work with DOCTOR.  @@@.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Um so yeah.

PATIENT X605
@@@.

DOCTOR X605
Um, I was talking to DOCTOR, who I know you saw last time.

PATIENT X605
Yeah.

DOCTOR X605
Um so how you doing today?

PATIENT X605
Still have back pain.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
And the headaches.

DOCTOR X605
When do you see Neurology next?

PATIENT X605
Uh I just saw them Monday.

DOCTOR X605
Yeah.

PATIENT X605
Yeah.

DOCTOR X605
And they said that they were still waiting for the reports?

PATIENT X605
I don't know.

DOCTOR X605
Is that right?  Cause I think they're the ones that have to make the decision if they want to treat your headache so that they want to do.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Okay um it looks like from your tests though that the EEG that they did where they stuck all those electrodes on your head.

PATIENT X605
Right.

DOCTOR X605
It looked normal.  So the findings were normal and symmetrical patterns were seen.  No evidence was seen in the sleep and waking methods or any focal or diffuse abnormalities so that's good.  At least they don't see anything wrong.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Um.

PATIENT X605
But she said something about a concussion, a mild concussion or something.

DOCTOR X605
Are they gonna do?  Well on the EEG Report it doesn't show any of that.  Um I don't know what she said.  If she said anything about a concussion because she didn't write anything about it and then are they gonna do like a MRI or anything like that?  Oh they did the MRI.

PATIENT X605
Well they did most of all the testing.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
I don't know about any more testing.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
The only thing that she said that it would be in a report was a mild concussion.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
I @@@.

DOCTOR X605
I think we need to have you see the neurologist again though.

PATIENT X605
Uh when?

DOCTOR X605
To see if they want to do anything about it.  Um.

PATIENT X605
Just saw them Monday.

DOCTOR X605
Well the only thing is awaiting results of the ABER for closed concussive symptoms.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
And loss of balance.  So you might need @@@ surgery or less aggressive treatment of nauseating @@@ if the ABER is also normal.  And the ABER results are normal so that's, they probably recommend treating the migraine then.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.  Um whenever your fax came and that's the EEG so let's enter that.  Um I think that's in.  Okay.  What are you taking for pain?

PATIENT X605
Well I'm taking the tramadol.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
And the neurologist asked me to cut back on the, cut back on the um Tylenol because they can damage my liver.

DOCTOR X605
Can hurt your liver.

PATIENT X605
Yeah they can damage my liver.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
And uh they want me to take the Tylenol just rather than four times a day, take it one time a day.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
Just to cut back you know, but what I'm saying after I cut back.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
Then what am I gonna use for the pain?

DOCTOR X605
Hmm.

PATIENT X605
I know that they increased the dosage of tramadol to 50%.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
I don't know, I know they increased one of them to 50%.

DOCTOR X605
So how often are you taking the Tylenol right now?

PATIENT X605
I was taking it four times a day.

DOCTOR X605
Is that one tablet or two tablets four times a day?

PATIENT X605
Two tablets four times a day.

DOCTOR X605
And now what are you taking?

PATIENT X605
Now I'm taking two tablets once a day.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
Because they said I've been taking the Tylenol for a long period of time.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
Which has been over a year.  Almost a year and six months.

DOCTOR X605
Okay and the tramadol how much or how often are you taking it?

PATIENT X605
The tramadol twice a day.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.  So you can take the tramadol up to four times a day.

PATIENT X605
Increase it?

DOCTOR X605
Yeah you can take it up to four times a day.  That's how it's order at least.  Do you have your bottle?

PATIENT X605
No I don't have it.

DOCTOR X605
Yeah if you read the medication bottle it says it on there too.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Um the Tylenol, I don't know why they would tell you to take less.  You've had liver function tests done.

PATIENT X605
Yes.

DOCTOR X605
And that was in February.

PATIENT X605
Yes.

DOCTOR X605
And they actually don't look bad so you can actually take more Tylenol than just two tablets once a day.

PATIENT X605
What are you suggesting we take?

DOCTOR X605
Um the maximum dose is taking two tablets four times a day.

PATIENT X605
So that's eight tablets a day.

DOCTOR X605
Right.

PATIENT X605
That's what I was taking.

DOCTOR X605
That was, yeah that's the maximum you can take per day.

PATIENT X605
Go back to taking them?

DOCTOR X605
Well how's your pain doing?

PATIENT X605
Well I'm still with the pain.

DOCTOR X605
Is it mostly back pain?

PATIENT X605
No both, headaches and back pain.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
So what I'm asking you is.

DOCTOR X605
Is what you should do.

PATIENT X605
Because the neurologist said cut back now you're telling me to keep taking them.

DOCTOR X605
Well I don't know.  The neurologist really didn't write too much in her note here um, it actually didn't say that.

PATIENT X605
Because she said because of my liver.

DOCTOR X605
Yeah.  If you take it in high doses and more than the recommended amount yeah.

PATIENT X605
But I'm just taking what's recommended.

DOCTOR X605
I understand.

PATIENT X605
On the bottle you know.  Why would she say cut back on it and you said take more?

DOCTOR X605
I think take what's recommended on the bottle.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Your liver isn't bad right?  Are you a drinker?

PATIENT X605
I don't drink.

DOCTOR X605
No alcohol okay.  Um let's see.  So then how have your sugars been doing?

PATIENT X605
I was told it was normal, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR X605
Do you check it every day?

PATIENT X605
Yes I checked it uh once every day.

DOCTOR X605
Your sugars.

PATIENT X605
I check it in the morning and don't check it that evening, check it the following evening after the meal, two hours after meals that's what he told me now.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.  Do you have the numbers?  You have a lot of sugars in the 90s.

PATIENT X605
Um not, I'm trying to stick with it.  Sometimes I fall off you know.  I try to keep up with it.

DOCTOR X605
Actually they're not too bad.  You've got @@@ here now.

PATIENT X605
Guess that's when I fall off the wagon @@@.

DOCTOR X605
Why did you check your blood sugar at 2:08 in the morning, is the timing on these right?

PATIENT X605
I don't know.

DOCTOR X605
When was the last time you checked your blood sugar?

PATIENT X605
I checked it.

DOCTOR X605
The 135 and what time is that from?

PATIENT X605
That uh in the morning, that was last night the last one.

DOCTOR X605
This 130 happened was last night?

PATIENT X605
Yeah.

DOCTOR X605
You're gonna have to, take it to the pharmacist today, have him change the time.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Because it says 1:12 p.m. so this looks like its yesterday after lunch.

PATIENT X605
Just take it to the Pharmacy and tell them to change the.

DOCTOR X605
Yeah, they need to change the settings.

PATIENT X605
I'm not up at 1:47 in the morning.

DOCTOR X605
That's what I, well yeah, this is at 1:12 p.m. and then this is at 2:08 a.m. which doesn't make too much sense.

PATIENT X605
No, no.  I'm not up that time of the morning.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.  

PATIENT X605
Is the time incorrect, can you set it?

DOCTOR X605
I don't know how to set it.  That's why I said take it to the pharmacist, it's the first floor on the right and they can actually do it for you.

PATIENT X605
Is it all the way down?

DOCTOR X605
No on this hallway.

PATIENT X605
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X605
The first door on the right, with the blond lady, short blond hair.  She's with DOCTOR @@@.

PATIENT X605
Where about over here?

DOCTOR X605
Yeah.

PATIENT X605
Straight across?

DOCTOR X605
In this hallway.  It's the first, when you're coming towards this way it's the first door on the right.

PATIENT X605
Alright.

DOCTOR X605
So when you're leaving here, it's the last door on the left.

PATIENT X605
Okay so it's just like where the uh blood test area?

DOCTOR X605
I'll take you there, don't worry about it.  

PATIENT X605
Because some of the pharmacists, I know once it's in the hallway I think down there.

DOCTOR X605
Hmm.  Are you taking amitriptyline at bedtime?

PATIENT X605
Yes.

DOCTOR X605
Is that helping at all?

PATIENT X605
Uh, cause I don't, because I'm not, at least I'm getting some sleep.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
You know.  It just seems I'm up through the night.

DOCTOR X605
Are you still taking meclizine?

PATIENT X605
Yes I am.

DOCTOR X605
You are taking it three times a day?

PATIENT X605
Taking all my meds, even some of the stomach.

DOCTOR X605
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X605
No I'm trying to cut back.

DOCTOR X605
And when was the last time you had a cigarette?

PATIENT X605
Uh day before yesterday.

DOCTOR X605
How often are you smoking?

PATIENT X605
I'm trying to smoke as less as possible.

DOCTOR X605
I know but like how often, like four cigarettes a week or?

PATIENT X605
Uh something like two maybe three.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.  

PATIENT X605
I cut way back on the smoking.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
I used to smoke a pack every other day.

DOCTOR X605
Okay, so you @@@.

PATIENT X605
This gum has helped it sometimes but sometimes you just get the craving.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
Nothing like that cigarette I smoke.  So it's alright because I asked somebody from the Surgery Clinic that was supposed to be for March 4.

DOCTOR X605
What is it?

PATIENT X605
They called my house.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
And they just wanted to know that, what they called vascular imaging and scheduled me for surgery.

DOCTOR X605
For your hand?

PATIENT X605
This Saturday.  Yes it is.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
It's Friday.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
And everything is normal for that.

DOCTOR X605
Oh they said it was positive to be under slightly better control but you should be okay yeah.

PATIENT X605
Okay.  I stopped @@@ that day, said I was doing great.

DOCTOR X605
Yeah, it's just that we need to recheck some labs today to see how you're doing.  And uh you ate today I take it?

PATIENT X605
I ate this morning.

DOCTOR X605
Has it been eight hours since you ate?

PATIENT X605
No.

DOCTOR X605
No okay.

PATIENT X605
It was about 10 this morning.

DOCTOR X605
We need to retest your total cholesterol then.  @@@.  How's your dizziness?

PATIENT X605
Well I haven't fallen lately.

DOCTOR X605
You haven't.

PATIENT X605
That's a good thing.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
Wasn't like when it first started.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
I had to hold on to something; at least now my head is not spinning.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
Because it was before.  It was like my head was like spinning when I get up.

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
Spinning when I go to sleep to lay down so at least that's not spinning.  So taking the meclizine is doing some good.

DOCTOR X605
Yeah.  Deep breath.  Just breathe normal.  Swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X605
Pardon?

DOCTOR X605
Swelling in the legs?

PATIENT X605
I don't know.

DOCTOR X605
It's kind of thin there.  Did you put some lotion on there?

PATIENT X605
Yeah but I'm peeling now.  You see the blister on my sock?

DOCTOR X605
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X605
It's like I shed down on here.

DOCTOR X605
You shed a lot?

PATIENT X605
In the winter.

DOCTOR X605

PATIENT X605
Coming into spring.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.  Didn't feel too good with that.

PATIENT X605
Yep.

DOCTOR X605

PATIENT X605
Yeah actually moving too fast.

DOCTOR X605
Have a seat down there.  Let me go grab DOCTOR and see if we can try to figure out what we're gonna do for your @@@.  Alright, I'll be back.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Okay one sec.

(DOCTOR OUT:  61:19  DOCTOR IN:  68:29)

DOCTOR X605
Okay um for the Tylenol, @@@ okay, @@@.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Um and we need to check some labs.  @@@.

PATIENT X605
Huh?

DOCTOR X605
The hemoglobin A1c is a marker to see how your sugars have been doing, so we need to get that, the cholesterol and um @@@.

PATIENT X605
Okay.

DOCTOR X605
Um and then @@@ the metformin that you're taking for the diabetes, we're gonna bump it up a little bit.  Um you're on 500 mg twice a day, we're gonna go up to 850 twice a day.  And the metformin can actually cause some low blood sugars, but your sugars are still high and we need to get them lower.  Do you usually get your meds by mail or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT X605
No I'll pick it up.

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
I'd rather pick it up than for it to be sent out because then it goes to the post office and it sits there and so then I have to go.

DOCTOR X605
@@@.

PATIENT X605
See them coming last week, it was the only week I had a small week.  I had no visits last week.  That's on the weekend @@@.

DOCTOR X605

DOCTOR X605
Okay.

PATIENT X605
So I have to go back to the Wellness Center, something else come back up so.

DOCTOR X605

PATIENT X605
Well I have to be out here in the morning.

DOCTOR X605
For labs.

PATIENT X605

DOCTOR X605
Oh.

DOCTOR X605

PATIENT X605
Okay now the metformin is the first one you gave me.

PATIENT X605
And take the metformin still twice a day.

DOCTOR X605
Yeah but at the higher dose.

PATIENT X605
Okay you giving me a higher dose.

DOCTOR X605
Right.

PATIENT X605
But it won't make my sugar go real low.

DOCTOR X605
No the metformin doesn't bring your sugar down.

PATIENT X605
Okay.  Okay, but the one I take in the morning makes it drop like that.  Okay.  Still take it?

DOCTOR X605
Don't take it.

PATIENT X605
Don't take the metformin that I have at home, you're increasing the dosage.

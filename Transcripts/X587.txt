DOCTOR X587
Oh.

PATIENT X587
Actually I've experienced the muscle spasms in my face.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
And down through my arm.  It gets better and worse um.  I feel it's sort of just like a shooting pain from my like the middle of my spine.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Down into my legs, it kind of immobilizes me for.

DOCTOR X587
Both legs or just one?

PATIENT X587
Just one leg and it's always the same side.

DOCTOR X587
Which side?

PATIENT X587
It's always on this side.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

Uh having been used that before and occasionally I go uh, I have a niece who has asthma also.

DOCTOR X587

PATIENT X587
So occasionally, @@@ medications @@@ I borrowed an inhaler from her.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.  Is that just an albuterol med?

PATIENT X587
Yes.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
Uh.

DOCTOR X587
Um have you had to be in the hospital in the last year for your asthma at all?

PATIENT X587
No.

DOCTOR X587
Okay good.

PATIENT X587
Okay uh I've been to the doctors a couple times for it.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
That's the thing is.  I can work with migraines.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And uh my job has put me in a situation where occasionally I can work from home.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And my last job I did at home from my region.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
So I can work through migraines but when my back @@@ that's when I get treatment from here.

DOCTOR X587
Right, right.

PATIENT X587
So I just have to go and get treated for that.

DOCTOR X587
Okay so you go to the ER or Urgent Care, where do you go?

PATIENT X587
I go to the Urgent Care Clinic sometimes.

DOCTOR X587
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X587
I think my last visit was two Sundays ago.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
It's when I threw my back out.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
And I walked in and they kind of treated me like I was a drug dealer.

DOCTOR X587
Hmm, uh-huh, yeah that's happens all the time.  Sorry about that.

PATIENT X587
Yeah what happened was I went in the first time, they gave me Flexeril and uh ibuprofen.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And that was like an Urgent Care @@@ actual visit.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And I come in and she's like well do you want physical therapy and an x-ray.  Well I went through six months of physical therapy.  Uh I went to a chiropractor for my back.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Back in 2008.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
I would be out of pain for about six months.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
So I'd been through physical therapy uh I really don't want to go through physical therapy again.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Plus my schedule won't allow it and she changed the conversation now from you know medicine isn't a quick fix.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Isn't a long term fix.

DOCTOR X587
Right.

PATIENT X587
And so I told her well I didn't come in for medicine.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
As a matter of fact I did not take the Flexeril you gave me, the full bottle was attached.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
I can't be sleepy at work.

DOCTOR X587
Right, right.

PATIENT X587
You know.

DOCTOR X587
Did uh did you ever have any imaging of your back, any CT scans, x-rays, MRIs?

PATIENT X587
They did a x-ray there.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And uh the chiropractor did a MRI and I believe an x-ray.

DOCTOR X587
Okay and what did they say?

PATIENT X587
Uh they said I have like a bulging in my disk.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
And the Army said it was, I don't know if it was a general classification they said it was a lumbar strain.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.  

PATIENT X587
Actually is there any way I can get another one of these?

DOCTOR X587
Probably what is this?

PATIENT X587
This is my initial waiver.

DOCTOR X587
Oh okay, yeah probably we can get one of these.  I'll see if I can get them, you might just have to go to the financial people and they can print it out for you.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

DOCTOR X587
Let me ask DOCTOR, she might know.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

DOCTOR X587
Um okay so you mentioned a number of problems, specifically back pain but I'll ask you to prioritize.  That's one you need to list to be addressed.

PATIENT X587
What I'd like to be the most addressed is my emotional instability.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
That's a different kind of issue.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
Between the two of them uh.

DOCTOR X587
It's a tie.

PATIENT X587
The migraine usually hurts the worst.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
But it's the back pain that doesn't allow me to go to work.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.  What's uh medication are you on?

PATIENT X587
Tylenol, Motrin.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And I ran out of medication a long time ago.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.  So you used to take some other stuff, a migraine medication?

PATIENT X587
I was on Imitrex.

DOCTOR X587
Oh okay.

PATIENT X587
And then I was on Percocet for a stent but.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
I didn't like it.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X587
So.

DOCTOR X587
Did the Imitrex help?

PATIENT X587
I didn't help relieve the migraines.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
It helped prevent the migraines.

DOCTOR X587
Okay, okay.  That's good okay.  Um.

PATIENT X587
For my sleeping I was on trazodone.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
But I believe @@@ for the trazodone problem they @@@ over to the Flexeril.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
And it was like uh I would take it, I would have a window of sleepiness and that would pass and I would be up the rest of the night.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah that's terrible.  Oh man okay.  We definitely have some things we should work on.

PATIENT X587
Yeah I know.  I should have been in but I.

DOCTOR X587
No that's okay.

PATIENT X587
I'm glad to see you.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah I know.  Life @@@ sometimes.  It's a good thing your wife gets on you and you came to see me today.  Um so let's see and we can definitely restart some better medicines for the migraine.

PATIENT X587
Hmm.

DOCTOR X587
Um you know, since you can work through them and get them if you need them but it's not good to be in pain all the time so we can definitely try something for the migraines.  Um for the back pain I think that um we can, you can definitely keep using pain medicines.  I'd like to do some probably more imaging to see what's going on there.  It's been a while, since the last time you got an MRI was in 2008 and I'd kind of like to repeat that to see what is definitely going on there, if it's worse if it's better and maybe there's something we could do as far as some ablation, injection or surgery, something like that.  Just to see what our options are.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

DOCTOR X587
Um physical therapy is good.  It's @@@ to the time but it's something that @@@ to a procedure.

PATIENT X587
Do they also, I also have a clinic by me.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Do they also offer services at that clinic?

DOCTOR X587
Um the physical therapists here?  I think so.  Wherever you want to get it done.

PATIENT X587
Go in and get physical therapy.

DOCTOR X587
Oh could you get it over there?  Hmm yeah maybe not, you might have to get it here.  Is that @@@, where do you live?

PATIENT X587
I live in the northeast end.

DOCTOR X587
Where is that?  That isn't too familiar.

PATIENT X587
@@@ clinic here.

DOCTOR X587
Um no.

PATIENT X587
Okay it's about from here to about 50 miles from @@@.

DOCTOR X587
Okay, okay.  Um okay yeah so it's a little drive okay.

PATIENT X587
I go down the loop.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
I would go along west.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
But the issue would be like the day, it comes ever so often I get like these comp days.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Where I have like today @@@ off, I have another time of day I have an opening no matter wherever it comes they can get me.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah I do that.

PATIENT X587
That does give me time to get in for appointments.

DOCTOR X587
@@@.

PATIENT X587
Like just a regular.

DOCTOR X587
A regular physical therapy is not gonna work.  Okay.  Um well that's okay we can you know see what's gonna happen in the future.  Um and then especially this shooting pain in your spine I think imaging would be good you know.  Um and then finally what's going on with and we'll refill your albuterol um.  So we can take care of all those things um.  You could talk about something about insomnia, I'm going to ask DOCTOR if she can treatment that.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X587
Um and then well let's talk about this emotional stuff.  Do you want to, do you want to see someone.  I know you have a history of some bipolar issues.

PATIENT X587
Yeah.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah um, but you're not on any medication right now?

PATIENT X587
No.

DOCTOR X587
Okay so are you having a lot of trouble with that lately?

PATIENT X587
Uh I'm having difficulty with just being stable emotionally.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And then I'm also having issues with the whole PTSD.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.  Oh yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X587
And I was seen and I started counseling for that.

DOCTOR X587
Oh that's good.

PATIENT X587
But it was difficult for me to receive counseling.

DOCTOR X587
Oh okay.

PATIENT X587
And what I got from that was everybody else that was in there.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Weren't active duties.

DOCTOR X587
Hmm.

PATIENT X587
They were reserves.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And so as my conversation was that I'm having issues dealing with these convoys I've been on, the stuff I've seen, their issues were more along the line of active duty soldiers mistreated us.

DOCTOR X587
Oh.

PATIENT X587
And made it miserable and I talked to the doctor and I was like maybe this isn't something in my line.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X587
You know uh I have, I'm that generation that I'm serious.

DOCTOR X587
Right.

PATIENT X587
But I have issues connected to things I've experienced, things I've been through over there.

DOCTOR X587
Right.

PATIENT X587
And their issue, they're only problem is about me.

DOCTOR X587
Right, right, yeah.  Absolutely.  Sometimes they can make these issues even worse.  That's too bad.  Well what about, we should get you some individual counseling though I mean.

PATIENT X587
Yeah.

DOCTOR X587
Um yeah cause that's both of those things.

PATIENT X587
Right.

DOCTOR X587
And they might say in conjunction you should be given an extension so they @@@ therapist you could see you know.

PATIENT X587
I'm not really a, when it comes to like work stuff.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
I have problems in those areas and in my personal life now.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
When it comes to work and I'm basically directing something or doing something.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
I'm fine with @@@ session.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
As far as me and my personal life.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
I don't get very open with it.

DOCTOR X587
I see, okay.  You're like a lone wolf.  Okay.

PATIENT X587
It brings a lot of anxiety.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah okay.  Well we definitely can do individual sessions.  Um we'll, we can have you see one of our psychiatrists or psychologists here, we could do that.  Um and if there are questions you can come over and tell me and they'll work with you.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

DOCTOR X587
And they might also have some thoughts on new medications that might help.  Um I mean usually the @@@ is more for like war stuff @@@ PTSD but.

PATIENT X587
I've been through a long list of bipolar medications.

DOCTOR X587
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X587
And the reason I talked to the last doctor and I didn't get any more is because.

DOCTOR X587
Did they not help or you don't like the side effects or both?

PATIENT X587
I generally experienced much in terms of side effects.  Uh I would say there were times when I @@@.  I mean the problems you have in those type of emotions is like you have to actually care.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
So there is when you've been a span of time where I was supposed to take it and I did take it.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And I didn't get anything and I'm like okay for six months I haven't got anything.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
And then like a year later there might have been a time where it'd be getting to me, I was supposed to take it.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And I was like screw this and I'll stop taking it.

DOCTOR X587
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X587
Yeah.  That's the kind of problem with the bipolar.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
You know it just depends on what you're feeling at the time and what you guys might expect @@@ go.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah, yeah.  @@@.  Maybe yeah.  Okay I'm not the expert in any of that stuff or even what medicines there are so I'm going to leave it in the hands of those guys right now.  Uh I'm sure they'll bring that up.  So okay.  Um let me have you have a seat up here.  Let's take a look at those scans and see what's going on.  Do you have any kids? 

PATIENT X587
I have two.

DOCTOR X587
Oh congratulations.  That's great.  How old are they?

PATIENT X587
Uh 18 months and 4 1/2.

DOCTOR X587
Oh my God, so cute.  Oh the 4 1/2 is like he's adorable.  Is he a little rambunctious?

PATIENT X587
He exhausts us.  He's in preschool and he wants to come home and do everything.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
He saw someone else do.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah oh no yeah.  That's rough.  My sister @@@ started biting people.  I think he saw people doing that at preschool.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X587
That wasn't good, especially at this age.  He's not biting people is he?

PATIENT X587
No he's not biting.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
He throws, kind throws tantrum spells.

DOCTOR X587
Oh uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
So I have to, I usually you know I usually cause I have to go down to the city and back and I take the train, he usually ends up having to go about 12 hours plus being gone 12 hours and coming home that's when he just starts screaming at the top of his lungs.

DOCTOR X587
Right, right, right.  Yeah by then your wife picks him up too right.

PATIENT X587
Yeah.

DOCTOR X587
So it's tough on both of you.  Well at least he'll outgrow it.

PATIENT X587
Yeah.

DOCTOR X587
If you hopefully survive through it.  I'm gonna listen to your heart.  Is the preschool half a day or a full day?

PATIENT X587
He's in a half a day right now.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
We can't afford the full day.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.  I think it definitely @@@ more for a full day.  @@@.  Um deep breath good.  One more.  Good.  I'm gonna listen to your neck so I want you to hold your breath.  Good breathe.  Hold your breath again, good.  Okay.  Let's see, any problems with your hearing?

PATIENT X587
Uh I do have decreased hearing.

DOCTOR X587
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X587
Because uh the lack of using ear plugs in @@@.

DOCTOR X587
Probably the okay, okay.

PATIENT X587

PATIENT X587
Occasional nausea.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.  Now does that seem to be associated with food or?

PATIENT X587
I don't know just something that happens.

DOCTOR X587
@@@.  No pain in here?  I know it's not comfortable with me pushing around here, I'm sorry about that.  I'm gonna take a look at your legs.  Any leg swelling?

DOCTOR X587
Um before we get the MRI done.  So let me have you stand up here and let's see if you can like bend down in the front, does that hurt when you do that?

PATIENT X587
Uh no @@@.

DOCTOR X587
That's good.

PATIENT X587
I picked up uh my sweater.

DOCTOR X587
Oh okay.

PATIENT X587

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
Like @@@ the muscles.

DOCTOR X587
Well that's pretty impressive okay alright.  Try leaning to the side like that, does that hurt?

PATIENT X587
It's sore.

DOCTOR X587
Okay let's do the other side.

PATIENT X587
It's sore.

DOCTOR X587
Okay stand straight, @@@ from the hip, down how about that?

PATIENT X587
Any type of movement.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh, it's a little bit sore.

PATIENT X587
This right here, it's sore.

DOCTOR X587
It's right in here?

PATIENT X587
So even when I bend down.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah it's a little bit sore.

PATIENT X587
Yeah.

DOCTOR X587
So is it like all the spine itself or is it more in the muscles to the side of it?

PATIENT X587
I don't even know.

DOCTOR X587
Let me try something and see what I think.  Tell me if it hurts more over here and here or when I press down here?

PATIENT X587
Actually none of that hurts.

DOCTOR X587
None of that hurts, good that's what we want to hear, the negative to a positive.  Okay have a seat right down here.  Well, @@@.  Um let me talk with DOCTOR and come back and we'll get some prescriptions for you and then we'll send you over to see the Psych people today.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X587
They have like a walk-in thing where they'll get what you need set up with them.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X587
So what we're gonna do today is usually I'll call the clinic that day but it's also something that we'll order in the system for you okay.  And if they have thoughts of medicines they can discuss it with you.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

DOCTOR X587
Um and then finally um we might do some imaging.  You won't do that today; you'll just set it up when the appointment is made for you.  Um and I want to talk to you about some labs on you.  How @@@?

PATIENT X587
I don't know if they did anything.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah looks like they checked everything.  The cholesterol was done in 2007; your liver function tests are fine.  Your kidneys were fine.  Looks like everything was good back then um.  Probably don't, uh I might want to repeat the cholesterol and the chemistry.  Okay I'll order those two things.  Sometimes they really help with people @@@.  Okay anything else you want to mention before I go?

PATIENT X587
Nothing I can think of.

DOCTOR X587
@@@ the amount of stress that you really want to.

PATIENT X587
No I'm not on that @@@.  I had a couple of personal, not personal but other questions.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
I would like to see @@@.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
And then also get my @@@.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587

DOCTOR X587
Okay.  Yeah we can definitely work on that.

PATIENT X587
I don't know if you can get those to me.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
Yeah.  Then I was gonna request @@@.

DOCTOR X587
Okay let me see this.  I'll talk with DOCTOR on this yeah.  I see so you're not 100% service-connected?

PATIENT X587
No.

DOCTOR X587
So we need to get the form.

PATIENT X587
I'm only 70%.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
And also I was gonna see what it would take to get my rating changed.

DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
I talked to the VA Hospital and they said that if the symptoms are worse.

DOCTOR X587
Right.

PATIENT X587
And my symptoms are definitely getting worse.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
@@@.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah we can definitely look.

PATIENT X587
Except for like two things.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.  Um let me take this with me to show her so it could jog her memory.  Uh yeah let's see.

PATIENT X587
Did I mention my knee?

DOCTOR X587
No.

PATIENT X587
I had surgery on my knee.

DOCTOR X587
Oh when was that?

PATIENT X587
It was back in like 2000.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.

PATIENT X587
And since then I've been seeing @@@ for my knee pain.

DOCTOR X587
Okay, I'll see @@@.

PATIENT X587
But can I get something?

DOCTOR X587
Okay, uh-huh.

PATIENT X587
Um that basically prevents me from one because even walking to the train and you know uh any kind of walking I do hurts.  When I sit in a car for a long period of time it hurts.  I can't run to try and get in shape on the treadmill cause it.

DOCTOR X587
Okay.  Is that on the left or right?

PATIENT X587
It's my left knee.

DOCTOR X587
Left knee okay.

PATIENT X587
So between my back pain and my knee pain.

DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

PATIENT X587
It basically keeps me from.

DOCTOR X587

FIRST DOCTOR X587

PATIENT X587
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Um and then we're gonna do an x-ray of your lumbar spine and then we're gonna get some labs.  Your x-rays of the lumbar spine we can get them today if you want uh the MRI we'll have to have them schedule it through the Imaging Lab.  

SECOND DOCTOR X587 
Okay for migraines okay, I'm going to make a copy and give it to you so what you can do is once you have done the x-rays and blood tests you can go directly upstairs.

PATIENT X587
What was that?

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Sumatriptan and.

PATIENT X587
Was it a shot?

FIRST DOCTOR X587
No I think it may be Imitrex or it's in the Imitrex family.  The triptan family are like uh medications that we use for migraines @@@ don't have the pain.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
I think the brand Imitrex is sumatriptan.  There's a couple that are the triptan and I'll just check.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
What Imitrex is, okay.  Um we're gonna give you that medication and then a referral to see Neurology.  Um and we're gonna also get a MRI of the brain.  @@@.  Okay in general we're going to check labs, we're going to check your chemistry and then check your blood count and we're gonna check your liver tests.  And then you're gonna go to @@@.

PATIENT X587
And that would go with the bipolar also.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Uh-huh.  That's all the same.  They have a special board that's for the OIF/OEF @@@.  Um I also want to give you some albuterol just to have on hand so you can have your own inhaler.

PATIENT X587
The knee pain.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Yeah the knee pain I think that we are going to um, yeah I told DOCTOR about that.  We didn't really get into it.  The um, I mean the gout medicine and the salsalate that helps you with the back pain will also help the knee pain.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Um not that you won't still maybe have some pain and we'll have to readjust those since those are new meds or something but let's try these two, I'll put them in here and see.

PATIENT X587
But I won't be getting a consult to see the orthopedist for that sort of thing?

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Um I don't think so yet.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Yeah I mean yeah I don't know.  Orthopedic surgeons like to operate.  (Second doctor comes in the room) You don't think he needs to see Ortho for his knee do you?

SECOND DOCTOR X587
No.  There are so many things that need to be done it's just like.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X587
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
And then we'll want to do, we'll do an x-ray while you go get your low back x-ray.  Um okay, we're doing a lot today.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

DOCTOR X587
So we want to see you back soon.  So I'm going to call @@@, so you'll get a letter in the mail, you'll get a letter in four week.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Call for an appointment.  The letter will give you a number.  Um @@@ six to eight weeks.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
And by then you should have had the nuclear tests done and we can readdress, we'll follow up on the pain stuff to see if it's working or not.  If any of your labs are a little out of whack I will call you about them.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
If they are pretty much normal we can talk about them the next time I see you and I can tell you what they are.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587

PATIENT X587

FIRST DOCTOR X587
So labs are okay if I just leave it, it doesn't matter?

PATIENT X587
You can leave it on the 50 if you want to.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Okay.  Um okay so here's the plan.  It's a lot to do.  So I think what we should probably do first.

PATIENT X587
Can I use your pen?  I've got to write down, I also got to do the health credit @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Oh yeah.  But um.

PATIENT X587
I need to have you fill this out.  @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Oh yeah that's good.  @@@.

PATIENT X587
That's why I took the day off.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Yeah that was smart.  Um why don't you, you can make this appointment um, I think it's a @@@.  Oh I think Neurology calls you; yeah you know what Neurology will contact you with an appointment.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
But I put the consult in too.  Um I want you to go to the Lab and give a blood draw.  You can go to X-Ray which is on this floor but all the way down by the @@@.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Um @@@ Radiology X-Ray.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
The @@@ is very nice so just go in there.

PATIENT X587
That's towards the @@@ they give me an appointment.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
You come out our clinic and turn right so yeah towards X-Ray I guess.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
And then go to the Lab then X-Ray.  X-Ray will do the lumbar spine and then they'll schedule you for the MRI okay.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587

PATIENT X587
Outpatient.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
Go to the Lab, then you go to Pharmacy to get the meds.  Um somewhere in there.

PATIENT X587
How long is that gonna take, a long time?

FIRST DOCTOR X587
The meds usually take a while so maybe I'd go do this first and then go do the meds.

PATIENT X587
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
You know what I mean, especially if they want to like add anything or you want to try something they suggest then you don't have to go back twice.  That'd be terrible.

PATIENT X587
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X587
This one they should be able to direct you up here.  They might be able to fill it out up there um.  The social worker is the person that could answer that question and she's also the person that can help you with the @@@.

PATIENT X587
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X587

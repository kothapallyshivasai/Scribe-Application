PATIENT X637
Okay now then you got a report on there that, that the blood pressure was way up.

DOCTOR X637
Okay.

PATIENT X637
But it uh, but it was you know within.

DOCTOR X637

Um I think the problem is is driving here, well after I had lunch and then driving here on 290.

DOCTOR X637
It's higher now.

PATIENT X637
I think that, I don't notice it but I think that's what messes things up.

DOCTOR X637
Well sometimes your blood pressure is a little lower in the morning and you know we don't want to have it at 158.

PATIENT X637
Right, right.  Okay now to ask you the second question.

DOCTOR X637
Yeah.

PATIENT X637
Did I take them this morning?

DOCTOR X637
Yes.

PATIENT X637
No.

DOCTOR X637
Alright.  So, @@@ here @@@.

PATIENT X637

DOCTOR X637
That's all you're really taking and um I want to talk to your blood pressures a little.  Even though it's good in the morning it fluctuates throughout the day.

PATIENT X637
Yeah well it's milder you know after eating and other things and like that why it's bound to go up yeah.

DOCTOR X637
Right.  Um.

PATIENT X637
But not as much as what it did.

DOCTOR X637
Right.  How's the osteoarthritis?  How are your joints feeling?

PATIENT X637
Bad.

DOCTOR X637
Bad.  Do you take anything for them?

PATIENT X637
Um down in Florida why I had, well now it's sore and like that, this ankle and of course arthritis as you know, arthritis goes from one to the other.

DOCTOR X637
Right.

PATIENT X637
Years ago when I was in my 20s I broke both ankles.  I think it was this one that just had, just had the crack and the other one had a spiral fracture into it so arthritis goes back and forth.

DOCTOR X637
Right.

PATIENT X637
Both knees why I've blown those out years and years ago.

DOCTOR X637
Okay.

PATIENT X637
So I have problems with my knees also and that's why every once in a while I walk with a stick.

DOCTOR X637
I see, I see.

PATIENT X637
So um um.

DOCTOR X637
Do you have time to get labs checked today?

PATIENT X637
What kind of a check?

DOCTOR X637
Labs, just the labs.

PATIENT X637
Oh the blood you mean.

DOCTOR X637
Yeah, do you have time for the lab tests?

PATIENT X637
Yeah sure.

DOCTOR X637
And for the medication do you want to pick all this up?  Do you normally pick this up from the Pharmacy or have them mailed?

PATIENT X637
No that takes too long and by the time I would get there why I have my car in the valet.

DOCTOR X637
Hmm.

PATIENT X637
And if you don't get there before the valet leaves then you have to walk all the way up to what is it the sixth floor or something like that.

DOCTOR X637
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X637
And I can't do that.

DOCTOR X637
Okay.

PATIENT X637
So no just have it sent, all of them sent.

DOCTOR X637
Okay.

PATIENT X637

DOCTOR X637
They should have it in the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X637
Well yeah but I just changed the address this morning and like that.

DOCTOR X637
Okay so you have to go, cause I can't change it in the computer.

PATIENT X637
Now the woman there she said it would change to all of them.

DOCTOR X637
Okay yep, then it'll change and that's where they'll mail it to you.

PATIENT X637
Yeah I asked her particular if it would change in the Pharmacy and she said yes.

DOCTOR X637
Yep, yep.

PATIENT X637
So I hope they send it to the right place.

DOCTOR X637
Exactly.

PATIENT X637
If they don't it goes to Florida, then comes back.

DOCTOR X637
Let's see oh yeah, that wouldn't be good.

PATIENT X637
I wouldn't trust the post office too.

DOCTOR X637
Yeah I'm with you.  Um and you needed the @@@.  So the wafer one +40, So how many of those 4 inch by 4 inch wafers do you use each day?

PATIENT X637
Uh okay you're regularly supposed to use one a day.  I take and cut the center out, that's one time and then there's the edges that I use that's another time so two of them uh, one lasts for a week.

DOCTOR X637
Okay.

PATIENT X637
And there are five into a box.

DOCTOR X637
Yeah okay, so you need six boxes, I see okay, got it.

PATIENT X637
Now that's to take me to six months I hope.  If that doesn't why I'll be here and I can order it but when I'm down in Florida why uh, I can send the order back and like that if I get an order but if there wasn't any refills or like that well then I'm sort of stuck.

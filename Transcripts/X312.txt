DOCTOR X312
PATIENT?   

PATIENT X312
How you doing?

DOCTOR X312
Okay and yourself?

PATIENT X312
Good.  @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Follow me.  Yeah. 

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
How have you been?

SECOND PERSON X312
He's been real good.

PATIENT X312
My only problem so far, well other than the blood pressure that I just found out it was high, I fell back in the middle of January.  I tripped and uh injured my wrist and uh but it's not getting any better, it might be worse.  When I fell it swelled uh and there was pain in the shoulders and I get a burning sensation in the shoulders, but that's the side and my left shoulder is a little bit, not the same as it was prior to the fall, it's not gotten any better.

DOCTOR X312
Which hand is it?

PATIENT X312
The right hand.

DOCTOR X312
And the right shoulder?

PATIENT X312
Left shoulder.  Yeah and it continues.  This is minor so the wrist is not healing.

DOCTOR X312
It's been going on for the past three months you think?

PATIENT X312
Um since the middle of January, so about two months.

DOCTOR X312
And you've been able to use that hand or you still?

PATIENT X312
I use it but I'll give you, I brought this cause I tried to write something the other day and this is what happens with my signature.  It shook so bad that that's how it looks.

DOCTOR X312
Hmm.

PATIENT X312
So when I start, when I held the pen, it started to shake and that is sort of a representation of what I was trying to write.  There's pain in this position like that and it's located here and here and this area here.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X312
So like I can't push down, and it's much better laying down.  @@@ I could do a push-up or something like that it's different.  The only other little bitty minor thing would be holding @@@ some hook, they did a surgery a year ago and @@@ surgery minor and sometimes there's some numbness in the area @@@.

DOCTOR X312
You're still able to walk and do everything else?

PATIENT X312
Oh yeah, the foot is actually 100% better than it was prior to the surgery.

DOCTOR X312
And how did you end up falling, do you remember?

PATIENT X312
Oh the first.

DOCTOR X312
For @@@.

PATIENT X312
Oh okay, what was happening is uh I was meeting the barber coming out when I was walking into the door and the sidewalk, a tree must have lifted up the sidewalk and I wasn't paying attention to the sidewalk as much as the other door coming unfortunately and there was a change in elevation or whatever between one angle of the sidewalk to the other and I tripped on that.  Since then I've been @@@ they repaired that area so that.

DOCTOR X312
Any lightheadedness or anything?

PATIENT X312
Pardon?

DOCTOR X312
Any lightheadedness?

PATIENT X312
No.

DOCTOR X312
Any chest pain or feeling like your heart's racing?

PATIENT X312
No, you know I feel fine.

DOCTOR X312
@@@?

PATIENT X312
No I have not, no @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Oh good.  

PATIENT X312
Although my mother @@@ consciousness at times.

DOCTOR X312
Any falls previously?

PATIENT X312
Uh that's how I broke my foot though back in 2009; I tripped over a drywall lift so.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
I'm not that prone to falling.

DOCTOR X312
Okay, I see.

PATIENT X312
I was looking at a hammer and there was an apparatus there's three legs that come out and I was looking beyond the legs sticking out and I actually didn't fall.  I put my foot off to prevent the fall and the stress I guess.

DOCTOR X312
Hmm.

PATIENT X312
Caused the break.  Technically I didn't fall, fall okay.

DOCTOR X312
So as far as the medications, you're still up-to-date, do you need any medications?

PATIENT X312
No I'm okay.  Yet there was one that was discontinued um @@@ I think.

DOCTOR X312
Hmm.

PATIENT X312
@@@.

DOCTOR X312
And that was discontinued or?

PATIENT X312
Yeah it just ran out.

DOCTOR X312
How long ago did you last take it?

PATIENT X312
Gee I don't remember I'd say a couple months ago.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X312
Uh uh.  @@@ whatever, I can't pronounce either one of those.  Blood pressure was high.  And then they sent me something, I don't know @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah your blood pressure is up.

PATIENT X312
But I haven't taken the blood pressure medication today.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.  And you're still taking the pantoprazole?

PATIENT X312
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X312
Still have refills?

PATIENT X312
Yes uh-huh.  @@@ much of it seems like antacids.  Um there was a period where one week that I got three episodes of reflux and uh aspiration in the lung.  That's not caused by uh @@@ it's based on really how tired I am for some reason.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.

PATIENT X312
Uh other than that one week for a period or so, very few, few and far between.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.  And how has your weight been?

PATIENT X312
It's gaining.  I think it was around 200 today.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT X312
It's a problem.

DOCTOR X312
You been trying to gain weight?

PATIENT X312
No I was not.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.  Are you exercising?

PATIENT X312
Each night I walk about three miles with the dog.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X312
And it's not really exercising.

DOCTOR X312
Still @@@.

PATIENT X312
I'm not sure that @@@.

DOCTOR X312
@@@ yeah.  Finding any difficulty urinating?

PATIENT X312
No.  Nothing really other than the wrist right now, nothing.

DOCTOR X312
Any stools that are black in color?

PATIENT X312
No, just @@@ occurred after one of those @@@ coming up from @@@ shortly thereafter @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Looking at the x-rays of the wrist.

PATIENT X312
What could be doing this?

DOCTOR X312
Various bones and it has like eight bones and so.

PATIENT X312
It's just this part, junction right, it junctions.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah but it still potentially be a bone that's in there.

PATIENT X312
Oh.

DOCTOR X312
So it could be a nerve, so it's good to get an x-ray and we can have you do physical therapy as well as we need to kind of strengthen the joint if there's something that's causing problems.

PATIENT X312
I really haven't been, that's one of those things especially if you fall in front of a woman or a girl, you're like it could be broken, whatever, you just get up and I'm fine.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
Then you go home and cry but like it did swell.  I don't recall any black and blue, @@@ but the hand just swelled in this area.  This side gives me more pain than this side.  This is the side that swelled

DOCTOR X312
Do you smoke at all?

PATIENT X312
No I don't smoke and I don't drink.  Is the MOVE Clinic, it's some sort of exercise program?

DOCTOR X312
It is yeah.  Are you interested in it?

PATIENT X312
Is that somewhere you do cardiovascular?

DOCTOR X312
Not just no.

PATIENT X312
What do they do?

DOCTOR X312
Here they work on diet and various exercise programs that one can do to help people lose weight.

PATIENT X312
Let me see if I could do it by myself.  But it's something if I can't, I would be interested.  I really enjoyed the cardiovascular program that I did.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X312
You know @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah any history of any sexual problems @@@?

PATIENT X312
No.  How much longer will you be working at xxx?

DOCTOR X312

PATIENT X312

PATIENT X312
Hmm.

DOCTOR X312
I have family in xxx and xxx.

PATIENT X312

DOCTOR X312
So yeah, I can't really say, we'll see.

PATIENT X312
People go to new clinics, not a bad place.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
Most of xxx.

DOCTOR X312
Have you ever had an ultrasound of your abdomen before?

PATIENT X312
No I have not.  Might have been done.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah I think they've done it in the past before.  @@@ at this time.

PATIENT X312
@@@.

DOCTOR X312
For people in their 60s, no one under 40 @@@.  No abdominal pain @@@?

PATIENT X312
No nothing.  Is that something that's protocol?

DOCTOR X312
It should be.  You're not having any kind of muscle aches or anything?

PATIENT X312
No.

DOCTOR X312
You've been taking that medication for a while too?

PATIENT X312
Yes, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X312
Something I can just continue to watch as well.  

PATIENT X312
Hmm.  Now what was it 60?

DOCTOR X312
One was 60 and the other one's 100.

PATIENT X312
And both of them are supposed to be?

DOCTOR X312
The first one's supposed to be under 40 and the second one is under 60.

PATIENT X312
Oh they're elevated.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
Hmm.  I think I have a @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah I definitely think we should do an ultrasound and check some other labs.  No weakness or fatigue?

PATIENT X312
No not really.

DOCTOR X312
You don't see any color @@@ or anything?

PATIENT X312
No.

DOCTOR X312
Joint pain?

PATIENT X312
Joint pain here.

DOCTOR X312
Other than that wrist, no where?

PATIENT X312
No nothing, nothing.

DOCTOR X312
Good okay.  Deep breath through your mouth.  Good, you can breathe normal.  Do you get any swelling in your legs at all?

PATIENT X312
No nothing.  This is where the pain, @@@.  This is where the pain originally comes from.  Not uh.

DOCTOR X312
@@@.

PATIENT X312
No I don't have anything like that.

DOCTOR X312
I've had other patients with that similar.

PATIENT X312
And it was bilateral on both sides.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
And uh on this side.

DOCTOR X312
@@@.

PATIENT X312
So I'm generally aware of pain that might originate or doing it.

DOCTOR X312
Relax your arm.  Not too bad, I got 150/78.  It should be under 140.

PATIENT X312
Hmm.

DOCTOR X312
So not terrible.  Just lay back for me.  And you said you didn't take your medications @@@.

PATIENT X312
Yeah.

DOCTOR X312
And just turn your head to the left.  Okay go ahead and sit back up.  Have a seat in the chair that you were.  Any pain?

PATIENT X312
No pain, not when you touch it.

DOCTOR X312
Are you able to do this?

PATIENT X312
I could do it but this is @@@ pain.

DOCTOR X312
And what about @@@.

PATIENT X312
That's fine.

DOCTOR X312
How far back could you put them?

PATIENT X312
I could all the way back; this is where the pain is originating.

DOCTOR X312
And what about when I do this?  Going up the side and this side @@@.

PATIENT X312
Not so much, much less than it was.  The other thing is when I would shake somebody's hand oh about a month after shaking their hand would be a problem.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X312
This was the position of the palm.

DOCTOR X312
Okay and hold your fingers out like this, go ahead and squeeze @@@.  Now squeeze my fingers as tight as you can.

PATIENT X312
What?

DOCTOR X312
I want you to squeeze me just like that.

PATIENT X312
Oh.

DOCTOR X312
As tight as you can, let me pull back.  @@@.  Your strength is a little decreased.  Is it hard when you try to write or sign your name?

PATIENT X312
Um it changes when I write.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.

PATIENT X312
And that was an example of what happens but not all the time.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
Only at times.  

DOCTOR X312
I'll talk with some of the other doctors and I'll be back then.

PATIENT X312
Okay.  My liver enzymes.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
They were elevated before.  I had taken part in a clinical trial many, many years ago with the Zocor and @@@ they put them together and @@@ research.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X312
And um my liver enzymes went pretty high there and they took me off that study.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.  No you're fine.  We can see.  @@@ can cause a little bit of jump @@@.  But looking at your enzymes from before and it's been a year and a couple of years @@@ a while and then @@@ time in 2005 up to 2011 you were always fine and you were taking it then so I don't know.  It's @@@ now and you've had times before they were a little higher.

PATIENT X312
Okay I didn't even look @@@.

DOCTOR X312
We'll @@@.  Something that hasn't helped you, your cholesterol numbers have been doing, let's take a look at that, we want you kind of under 100 for sure and maybe under 70.  There are times here you're pretty good like under 70, 70 and this time you're up to 104 so you're above where we want you.  We definitely want you under 100.

PATIENT X312
Yeah.

DOCTOR X312
And so it's a matter of statin @@@.  Also weight loss and exercise can play a role in that too.  

PATIENT X312
Depending on my weight.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah you're weight has gone up 10 pounds and so this could be a reflection of the weight more than anything too so.

PATIENT X312
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X312
Something we need to look into.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
But I'll talk with the other doctor and we'll see the next steps okay.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  86:40  DOCTOR IN:  92:40)

DOCTOR X312
Okay so we're gonna continue the statin.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
And we'll just recheck the labs in the future at the next visit so we might check and we'll give you a blood pressure cuff, we'll do x-rays of the wrist.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
We'll do an ultrasound of the liver to see and make sure it's what we think it is, this just may be because of, they call it fatty liver sometimes fat infiltrates the liver and it can cause these enzymes to go up.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
So we'll just make sure that's the reason behind this.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
And then I'll get you a splint for the wrist.

PATIENT X312
@@@.

DOCTOR X312
You don't want a splint then?

PATIENT X312
No.  Let's see what the x-ray shows first.

DOCTOR X312
And then I'll have them send this blood pressure cuff to your house.

PATIENT X312
Concerned about a couple things, one my weight, the blood pressure and the liver enzymes.  And that's a fatty, what do you call is that just liver or is that something that will clear up?

DOCTOR X312
With weight control and @@@ um.  Just the way that time progressed further and some other risk factors like hepatitis, viral hepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis.

PATIENT X312
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X312
Um it can progress further into oh.

PATIENT X312
I'll try to stay on the same dosage of blood pressure medicine.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah your pressure is nearly where we want it to be.  In fact you can just stay on the same medication that should do it.

PATIENT X312
Monitor that.  Uh feeling well is deceiving.  Numbers don't prove it.  Now the ultrasound they'll schedule that?

DOCTOR X312
Yeah you can maybe even schedule it at the front desk.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
So I put these labs in for three months.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
I think I should see you back then.

PATIENT X312
So in three months I would come and get.

DOCTOR X312
Just the blood work.

PATIENT X312
Just the blood work and then they would be given to you and then if anything out of the ordinary you'll contact me.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.  We can see you back in six months.

PATIENT X312
And you'll reorder the @@@?

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.  We'll just do fasting labs in three months time.

PATIENT X312
Okay.  They'll send out a letter for @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah they'll send probably a letter I believe.  Okay.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
And you are going to get the x-rays today @@@.

PATIENT X312
And then again if there's something wrong with the x-ray you'll contact me or somebody will?

DOCTOR X312
Definitely.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
Any other questions you have?

PATIENT X312
No, nothing.  My concern were the three things I mentioned the blood pressure, the weight and uh that helps with the support thing.

DOCTOR X312
Did you want to try the MOVE Program?

PATIENT X312
Um let me see how, it should come down with the warmer weather and @@@.

DOCTOR X312
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X312
If it doesn't I will definitely contact you.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X312
@@@ I did not realize that I was up that high.

DOCTOR X312
Okay.

PATIENT X312
So I'll go for the x-ray and get that done today.

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
And then labs in three months.

PATIENT X312
Right okay.  Do I take that?

DOCTOR X312
Yeah.  You can give it up front.

PATIENT X312
Okay.

DOCTOR X312
You can schedule the ultrasound okay.  

PATIENT X312
Okay.  Thank you very much.

DOCTOR X312
You take care @@@.

But it ain't swole up but it's the same pain I mean literally.  Feels like it's just pulling on something it ain't really hurting.

DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.  And how long has this been going on?

PATIENT X699
Uh I'd say a month.

DOCTOR X699

Did I really?

DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X699
Then you should see in the record, I swole up and I swole up this time.  They did it for every test from HIV to gonorrhea, nothing @@@ with any disease but something's wrong down there.

DOCTOR X699
Have you seen the urologist in the past?

PATIENT X699
Like what would they do now?

DOCTOR X699

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am, @@@.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.  You don't have any discharge, no milky discharge?

PATIENT X699
No ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
The swelling, is it on both sides?

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
Okay and you're sexually active right now?

PATIENT X699

PATIENT X699
Oh wow, probably two months ago.

DOCTOR X699
Do you use protection?

PATIENT X699
Yes.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.  The last time they put you on antibiotics for a month.

PATIENT X699
Is that what they did for me, cause I still don't know if that's right.  No did they put me in the hospital first?

DOCTOR X699
Uh uh.  They @@@ gave you IV antibiotics and then okay it's the same thing that happened then.

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am but then I swole and these just hurt like crazy.  @@@.

DOCTOR X699
You could have a swollen @@@.

PATIENT X699
No, no, it's just a little bit of swelling but it was swelled to the size of your hand, that I do not have.  Right now it's so sensitive when I touch one of them.

DOCTOR X699
So now it's just pain, no swelling?

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
And this has been going on for a month?

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
It's on both sides.

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
Did you hurt yourself?  Were you doing anything that caused an injury?

PATIENT X699
You know what I was being @@@ you know I had what you call a @@@ hernia operation at age 17.

DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X699
I was martial arts and a boxer so I didn't take it and suffered a lot.  I think it's unusual how low they hang in the scrotum @@@.  That's what I think, but other than that I don't know.  I @@@ a lot, uh I lift weights you know and all that, everything like that to keep @@@.  I don't know why this happens, it happens like every two years or something.

DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X699
I'm just glad they didn't swell up this time.  @@@ a long time @@@.

DOCTOR X699
So @@@ your cough and you're coughing.  Do you think it's something more on the back of your throat or is it coming from your lungs?

PATIENT X699
My lungs.  It's like a nasal drip that goes down and in the morning time I had to cough it all up you know.  

DOCTOR X699
Okay and did you, were you supposed to follow up with the urologist?

PATIENT X699
Not that I know of ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
This was a while ago, it was in 2008.

PATIENT X699
Right @@@.

DOCTOR X699
I think you saw them; you went back a couple of times after this.

PATIENT X699
Okay that was the reason yeah.  I @@@.

DOCTOR X699
That was in 2009.

PATIENT X699
Cause the other knee is doing the same thing, so I need to see another GP.

DOCTOR X699
What's going on?

PATIENT X699
Oh my God, @@@ it hurts like crazy, swells up and the ibuprofen, they gave me ibuprofen.

DOCTOR X699
Naproxen?

PATIENT X699
Yeah, yeah that, it does ease the pain so I had a couple of those I had left.  I don't have no more now, um I think it might need to be scraped like the other one was, they made it hurt, it continues to pop a lot.  It just swells up I mean.

DOCTOR X699
@@@.

PATIENT X699
Yes they gave @@@ it works great, this one like that @@@.  Well it's the same thing as this one.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.

PATIENT X699
But you know all in all, all I care about is getting this dry taste out of my mouth.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.  

PATIENT X699
Can you find it?

DOCTOR X699
Why don't you have a seat here I'm going to check your blood pressure first.

PATIENT X699

DOCTOR X699

PATIENT X699
No I didn't take it today.  So I didn't take it for the last week cause I'm trying to find out what's making my tongue numb.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.  Do you remember what it was that you were given?

PATIENT X699

DOCTOR X699

DOCTOR X699
And this is how bad it was before?

PATIENT X699
Oh no before it swole up it's like a 12, its unbelievable pain.

DOCTOR X699
So on a scale of one to ten.

PATIENT X699
Right now probably a nine.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.

PATIENT X699

DOCTOR X699

PATIENT X699
Hmm, yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
But there's never any discharge?

PATIENT X699

DOCTOR X699
You can go ahead and have a seat over there.  And as far as how it looks, it looks how it did before?

PATIENT X699
No ma'am cause now one ball swelled up the size of your hand.

DOCTOR X699
Right but I'm saying it's not swollen so before I mean.

PATIENT X699
You know it's a little swollen.

DOCTOR X699
Is it how it always looks?

PATIENT X699

DOCTOR X699
That's what I'm asking.

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am.  Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X699
Was it aripiprazole?

PATIENT X699
No ma'am that is instead of four times a day, four half @@@ a day, four pills a day uh.

DOCTOR X699
That's still @@@.

PATIENT X699
Yes, yes ma'am so but I stopped taking that like uh two weeks ago when my tongue first started to get dry.  Now it's gone from dry to extreme dry you know and I stopped taking everything all except four pills.  @@@ super dry.

DOCTOR X699
But you said that there's no pain or anything.  What is your hernia, you can lay back.

PATIENT X699
Whoa, my hernia, it's all the way across from here.

DOCTOR X699
Any pain here?  No and not on this side, that's not painful?

PATIENT X699
No.

DOCTOR X699
Okay, okay.  Alright you can sit up.  I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT X699
He uh.

DOCTOR X699
The main things are the dry mouth, the pain and then your knee pain right?

PATIENT X699
Yes ma'am but I like more @@@ if you could just solve that dry mouth.  I'm telling you it’s terrible ma'am.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.

PATIENT X699
It is terrible.

DOCTOR X699
Alright.  I'm gonna talk to DOCTOR.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:35  DOCTOR IN:  37:57)

DOCTOR X699
Okay, we'll do a couple of things.  We're going to put you on a new medication.

PATIENT X699
What?

DOCTOR X699
For your blood pressure and to help your heart rate too.  Um and we looked to try to see what could be causing this dry mouth and we think that the likely cause is probably the loratadine medication.

PATIENT X699
For my sinus?

DOCTOR X699
Yeah.

PATIENT X699
I think so too, I was gonna say can we change it back to Sudafed or Claritin.  I think @@@.

DOCTOR X699
Well let's try you off of, cause those medications do that so let's try you off of it and see how you do.

PATIENT X699
And then I'm gonna be stopped up all night.

DOCTOR X699
We'll see though cause I mean if it's causing you this much pain, or this much you know trouble.

PATIENT X699
@@@.

DOCTOR X699
Let's just hold off on the medication right now.

PATIENT X699
Alright.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.  Um so that's one thing.  So this new medication I'm starting is called metoprolol.

PATIENT X699
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X699
Okay and it's for your blood pressure and for your heart rate okay.  And the other thing is I'm gonna treat you like you have an infection down there um and give you ciprofloxacin, they gave you that last time.  

PATIENT X699
What is that, an antibiotic?

DOCTOR X699
An antibiotic.

PATIENT X699
Alright um it was like a screen before that you know @@@.

DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X699
I want to know if that's normal cause I don't think that's normal.

DOCTOR X699
Okay um it feels like it's inflamed.

PATIENT X699
Oh that just don't feel normal.

DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X699
I ain't never @@@.

DOCTOR X699
Sure.

PATIENT X699
I just wanted the doctors to see.  I don't think that's normal.

DOCTOR X699
Okay.  Do you want DOCTOR to come in?

PATIENT X699
No, no @@@ but you know ain't got a pair so you don't know what's.

DOCTOR X699
Sure I can have him come take a look just to make sure, would you feel more comfortable with that?

PATIENT X699
No.

DOCTOR X699
I'm not; if you want me to I can have him see you.

PATIENT X699
Well yeah, alright, thank you.  It hurts.

(DOCTOR OUT:  40:03  DOCTOR IN:  40:20)

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Hey.

PATIENT X699
Hey DOCTOR how you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR X699
What's going on?

PATIENT X699
I was @@@.  The swelling is actually gone but I just worry here, maybe when you go holding that.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
I've got the magic touch?

PATIENT X699
Yeah, yeah, see if it's normal cause I don't think it’s normal doc.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Oh well I don't think anybody here has called it normal.

PATIENT X699
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
We think you've got epididymitis and we're gonna treat you with an antibiotic.

PATIENT X699
What is that?

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Epididymitis in an infection where part of the scrotum is.

PATIENT X699
And this happens almost every two years like clockwork.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Yeah, yeah.  So I think, well the swelling is down, you know we could possibly have you seen by the prostate and the penis and the epididymis specialists.

PATIENT X699
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
To see if there's anything we can do to prevent it from occurring again but.

PATIENT X699
But man it hurts, especially when I sit.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
And I get @@@.

PATIENT X699
Its back up @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
And you're talking about?

PATIENT X699
I'm talking about this one.  It's like a @@@ in there.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X699
And it don't feel like it's supposed to be in there doc.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Let me know if I'm really hurting you, if I'm really hurting you.

PATIENT X699
Uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Right up there?

PATIENT X699
Um no.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
It just right there.

PATIENT X699
You feel that @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
All that anatomically it's all correct.

PATIENT X699
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
But you actually have the pain exactly where you have the inflammation in the epididymis.

PATIENT X699
Oh really.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
That's like a kind of @@@ are that runs up right above your testicle.

PATIENT X699
I knew when I was here I had four balls, I mean four testicles.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
You had four testicles?  Good God.

PATIENT X699
And nobody believed me.  My mother thought I, how do you explain @@@ watching you.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Yes.

PATIENT X699
Weight lifts and one time @@@ two balls and dropped two testicles, you actually have four testicles, did you know that?

SECOND DOCTOR X699
I didn't know that.

PATIENT X699
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
I think I would.

PATIENT X699
You got two up here and they would drop down so they cut me from here to here.  I don't know if they took it out or @@@ but I was originally given four and as I get older I got more problems with my scrotum sac.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Yeah.

PATIENT X699
And is they supposed to hang that low?

SECOND DOCTOR X699
@@@ that's normal.

PATIENT X699
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Yeah so we'll get you treated for that okay.

PATIENT X699
Okay.  So you say you got a guy that specializes in that?

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X699
You saw him last time.

PATIENT X699
Oh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X699
So we're giving you this to increase your urine.

PATIENT X699
Okay, so this is to dry it up or?

SECOND DOCTOR X699
Yeah, @@@ uh it's like if you want to get some relief you could elevate them you know if you're sitting down you put a towel up under there, that'll give you some relief.  It'll take probably three, four days for the antibiotics to fully kick in.

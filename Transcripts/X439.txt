DOCTOR X439
A pill box.

PATIENT X439
Yeah.

DOCTOR X439
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X439
@@@.

DOCTOR X439
It's important to take it every day.

PATIENT X439
I do, that's a fact.

DOCTOR X439
Um some of the other things, last time we checked your urine everything looked okay, except you have a lot of sugar in it okay.

PATIENT X439
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X439
Cause your diabetes isn't that well controlled.

PATIENT X439
Right.

DOCTOR X439
Um did the pharmacist talk to you about what all of your options are if your sugars aren't controlled on these medicines?

PATIENT X439
No.

DOCTOR X439
Okay.

PATIENT X439
I'm working on just taking the medication and just.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah I mean.

PATIENT X439
It's really better.

DOCTOR X439
You've only been on it a couple weeks so I don't think it's time to recheck the blood tests yet okay.  Um but just so you know if we max out on pills.

PATIENT X439
You gonna take the insulin.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah that's the next step.  I mean we're not to that point yet but just so you know that.

PATIENT X439
I'm not looking forward to that.

DOCTOR X439
So some of the things you can do is watch your diet.  I don't know what kind of things you eat right now.

PATIENT X439
I don't eat red meat that much.

DOCTOR X439
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X439
What I'm eating, I'm eating salads and eating @@@ and occasional once or twice a month I'll have pork chops.

DOCTOR X439
Okay.

PATIENT X439
Uh.

DOCTOR X439
What about sugar?  Like are you eating a lot of carbs like pasta, rice, white bread?

PATIENT X439
I eat uh wheat bread.

DOCTOR X439
Okay.

PATIENT X439
Oat bran, wheat.

DOCTOR X439
Okay wheat.

PATIENT X439
Uh.

DOCTOR X439
What about, do you eat a lot of sugar?

PATIENT X439
I eat a lot of, I eat those mixed nuts.

DOCTOR X439
Okay good.  It sounds like your diet is pretty good then.  You don't eat a lot of sugars or sweets or anything like that?

PATIENT X439
I have, I have sweets that I've bought but it's an occasional and I keep them in the refrigerator.  I have chocolate you know and every once in a while I have one.

DOCTOR X439
They make sugar free stuff too.

PATIENT X439
Where?

DOCTOR X439
Uh a lot of stores carry them.

PATIENT X439
I only shop at xxx's because it's more affordable for me.

DOCTOR X439
Okay.

PATIENT X439
It's closer.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah.

PATIENT X439
But I'll.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah, you know just keep eye on it for um.

PATIENT X439
Right.

DOCTOR X439
I mean they don't make everything sugar free but they make some stuff sugar free now um and that would help.  Weight loss will help with both the blood pressure.

PATIENT X439
No good but.

DOCTOR X439
And then.

PATIENT X439
They weighed me here before the appointment.  When I don't have everything I'm in the 252, 253.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah.

PATIENT X439
So that's not accurate.

DOCTOR X439
And you seem like a you know like a muscular guy but.

PATIENT X439
I used to be a power mixer.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah.  Still any amount of weight loss helps okay.  Just uh, something to think about.

PATIENT X439
I'm a maintenance engineer in my building.  I @@@ everybody can handle that so.  It's a 16 unite.

DOCTOR X439

PATIENT X439
What they told me is that maybe I should get some, a little cardio.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah.

PATIENT X439
Which I try to but it's hard to do with this weather.

DOCTOR X439
It is hard for you to do.

PATIENT X439
With this kind of weather.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah um, as the weather gets warmer then maybe it'll get easier.

PATIENT X439
Uh I like to go to the park.  I've been wanting to bike ride but then again I don't know if it's permitted in where I live.

DOCTOR X439
No I.

PATIENT X439
@@@.

DOCTOR X439
I.

PATIENT X439
No, I'm over here on Mondale, @@@ that's a war zone there you know, because of fire.

DOCTOR X439
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X439
Fights you know.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah no I understand you try.

PATIENT X439
Cause it's hard to keep the.

DOCTOR X439
The um, they have a MOVE Program here.  Have anyone talked to you about that?

PATIENT X439
I can't move because you know what.

DOCTOR X439
Well that's, no it's called the MOVE Program.  It's to help people diet and exercise.

PATIENT X439
Oh.

DOCTOR X439
It's not about moving, no, no, no, no.  It's um every Monday at 10 a.m. they meet in the Library and then talk.  They help people get you know set up with exercise.

PATIENT X439

DOCTOR X439
So um it's every Monday so you're more than.

PATIENT X439
That @@@ going through I been through.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X439
@@@ and if I could go maybe.  Like I said I used to be able to follow @@@.  I used to train people so I'm just going to have to just fall back into that cause making it over here every Monday @@@.

DOCTOR X439
But no you don't have to go every Monday but going once and then getting you know into maybe going once a month or something like that.

PATIENT X439
That's possible.  One of the reasons is location is what stops me.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah, yeah.  Just so you know that service is there um it's a walk-in and you don't need any forms or anything.  It's Monday at 10 a.m. okay.

PATIENT X439

PATIENT X439

DOCTOR X439
Okay.

PATIENT X439

DOCTOR X439
Um what are you taking for it right now?

PATIENT X439

PATIENT X439
What's the best?  What is the best?

DOCTOR X439
I'm gonna give you the one with whooping cough then you don't have to get that ever again.  It's a booster of the whooping cough that you got when you were a kid.

Or something in the mail?

DOCTOR X439
Um you can make your appointment at the front desk.

PATIENT X439
Okay what they can for you, are you able to prescribe if I needed something or requested something through you?

DOCTOR X439
Uh that depends, what are you asking for?  It depends.

PATIENT X439
Uh I need to see if I can try Cialis.

DOCTOR X439
Okay.  I thought that was what you were gonna ask.

PATIENT X439
Just, I'm not enjoying this at all.

DOCTOR X439
No um, what we have here is, we don't carry Cialis here at the VA.  We have um Levitra, similar type of medicine.

PATIENT X439
What does it do?  @@@.

DOCTOR X439
Yeah it's, it works the same but it's a different means okay.  Viagra, Cialis, Levitra they all do the same thing okay.  Um it's just this one you're seeing on TV more.  So.

PATIENT X439
And then, I was okay with the diabetes @@@ but once the high blood pressure kicked in I'm.

DOCTOR X439
So you take it before intercourse.

PATIENT X439
Okay.

DOCTOR X439
Um.  It helps you to have an erection.

PATIENT X439
Okay.

DOCTOR X439
Um and you have um.

PATIENT X439
How do you take a, excuse what?

DOCTOR X439
Yeah.

PATIENT X439
Half hour before, 10 minutes, right then when?  When is the best time?

DOCTOR X439

PATIENT X439
Two a month?

DOCTOR X439
I know, everybody complains about it.  I have no control over that though.

PATIENT X439
That's not good.  That's not good at all.

DOCTOR X439
That's all, um I'm gonna give you the lower dose right now okay.

PATIENT X439
Okay.

DOCTOR X439
Um and when you come back if it's not working we can go up to the higher dose so let us know.

PATIENT X439

DOCTOR X439
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X439
Now I say if they see what's wrong and they need to open it, open it or not.

DOCTOR X439

DOCTOR X439
Um.  Um we need to get an x-ray today.

PATIENT X439
Alright if I get lost they'll tell me.

DOCTOR X439
Uh but definitely stop at the front desk anyway and um schedule the orthopedic appointment.  Schedule the orthopedic appointment um and then go get your x-ray and then go to the Pharmacy.  That'll cut down in the time waiting in the Pharmacy.  I'm going to put in for you to come back in three months.

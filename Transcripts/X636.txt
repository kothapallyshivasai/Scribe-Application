DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Yeah so just looking at your meds when you were talking, what they presumed it was due to was @@@.  Um.

PATIENT X636
@@@ something coming on, I just thought it could be anything.  I was @@@ to read and watching TV

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And all of a sudden I felt like I was going to pass out.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
And I felt it coming on.

DOCTOR X636
Here.

PATIENT X636
And my breathing would be kind of tough.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And so I wouldn't fight it, I'd just, won't fight for air.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
I just gradually, gradually really out of control.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
But then @@@ it wouldn't go away, it kept getting worse.  

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
You know I'm getting weak.  My legs are getting weak.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
And not only was I out of breath but pain was in my chest.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
I knew it was gonna be a heart attack.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Or something.  That's why I came over.

DOCTOR X636
Okay well the good thing was it wasn't.

PATIENT X636
No it wasn't but.

DOCTOR X636
It definitely wasn't a heart attack. But it's really important.  Now you're an asthmatic is that correct?

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  You're not smoking cigarettes any more are you?

PATIENT X636
No I quit a long time ago.

DOCTOR X636
Okay and how's your breathing?

PATIENT X636
My breathing is alright.  You know it's been kind of, I think I'm coming down with a cold.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X636
He sounds kind of wheezy.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah he does, when he came in here.

PATIENT X636
And that's, and that's what I know I've got asthma.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Cause I don't got anything at home now but before whenever I got an asthma attack I'd go to the hospital, now I got a, what do you call it?

DOCTOR X636
A nebulizer.

PATIENT X636
A nebulizer.

DOCTOR X636
How often are you having to use that?

PATIENT X636
Well, when I get to the point where the medications aren't helping I go to the nebulizer and that helps it right away.

DOCTOR X636
How many times a week do you think you've been using that regularly?
SECOND PERSON X636
Um the last time he used it was in @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Oh excellent, oh good.  Okay good. 

SECOND PERSON X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
That tells me that the daily medications, cause the way that we treat this is try to get the daily medications to make you so you don't need the rescue medication.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
So um sounds like you're in a good place.  This season is trouble.

PATIENT X636
It is.

DOCTOR X636
Cause a lot of patients with um asthma or COPD.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Your airway type of reactions so if there's, if someone would get a little sniffle so that would be like a cold or whatever, it's gonna hang out and be a lot longer than it would with someone @@@.

PATIENT X636
Okay, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Um so I can deal with you being a little wheezy as long as you feel like you can walk around and you're not using the rescue inhaler too much.

PATIENT X636
Well I was worried because the ones @@@ problem I had to live with it that way.

DOCTOR X636
Really.

PATIENT X636
I couldn't get @@@ worry about it.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Usually I go to one of the other hospitals.

SECOND PERSON X636
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah sure.

PATIENT X636
@@@ a few months.

DOCTOR X636
Where do go?

PATIENT X636
Texas or California.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah, you go there.

PATIENT X636
Wherever @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah okay.  Any weakness in the legs?  Have you been sustaining any falls?

PATIENT X636
Not lately but I've been very careful.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
The trouble is that if I'm walking my back, in the low back.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
Cause when I get that pain on my back it's just, I have to fall and that's the only way that I could fall.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I have to be careful cause when I get the feeling I want to pull up and grab something.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
Because it's, I'm just pretty sure it's something I have.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
If there's nothing to hold on to.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah we got to be careful.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
You got to be careful.  That was just a comfort @@@. 

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
You're not on Warfarin and you have a filter?

PATIENT X636
Now I got a filter.

DOCTOR X636
Good.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Past medical history otherwise, cough, asthma, COPD and I read about the @@@ um @@@ is a pretty rare disease.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
I've never seen that.

PATIENT X636
@@@ is worse.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.  It's just a vasculitis thing but it's just not that common.

PATIENT X636
What is it?

DOCTOR X636
It's in the vasculitis family, it has to do with the blood clots but it's pretty rare, pretty rare.  Um other things that you have, you've had colon cancer in the past.

PATIENT X636
Right.

DOCTOR X636
That's right, okay.  Um they diagnosed you with an iron deficiency anemia when you were last in the hospital.

PATIENT X636
You know, I've had, the regular doctor, my regular doctor for years.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
When I sent @@@ from my private physician.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
I didn't involve him cause I've had him for over @@@ years.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X636
But he always told me, are you losing any blood anywhere.

DOCTOR X636
Right.

PATIENT X636
I said why.  He said your blood work always show you.

DOCTOR X636
A little anemic.

PATIENT X636
Yeah a little anemic and he knows about it.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
And uh the reason I got to looking through.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah I mean we worry, so when were you diagnosed with the colon cancer?

PATIENT X636
'89.

DOCTOR X636
Okay so you sometimes that's an early symptom of colon cancer and I don't know how yours presented but sometimes people will come in and just kind of will be.

PATIENT X636
@@@ actually I happened to be, I retired that year.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
From the job and I went in to see him, having an appointment and I said doctor I noticed some blood in my stool today.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
This morning and he said well I want you to send you to the Lab for some tests.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
He sent me to, you know I had lab there at the clinic and he sent me there and they didn't find anything @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
They sent me for the lab down there.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Good thing he did.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Cause they found the cancer.

DOCTOR X636
Um did you have a surgery to remove @@@?

PATIENT X636
Yes.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
Yeah I have an incision from here to here.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Did you have to have a bag at some point?

PATIENT X636
No.

DOCTOR X636
Did they connect.

PATIENT X636
No the doctor said that @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  I don't @@@ how long it is and that would have to be in the records to look um.  Are you having any blood in the stool or black tarry stools now?

PATIENT X636
You know what happened, I don't know maybe about three days ago I got up during the night, maybe 3 o'clock in the morning and I went to the toilet and I had something like diarrhea and I looked down and it was all blood.

DOCTOR X636
@@@.

PATIENT X636
About three years ago.

DOCTOR X636
Okay then what happened?

PATIENT X636
I went upstairs and I called @@@, you got to get up; I got to go to the hospital.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
She took me @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Did they do a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X636
They did a lot of stuff.

DOCTOR X636
What was the diagnosis?

PATIENT X636
They, that's when they found the uh.

SECOND PERSON X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Oh that was when they found @@@.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Okay wow, okay well yeah so I mean there's a couple explanations.  The fact that you had a colonoscopy as recent as three years ago I'm pretty confident that it's not a recurring colon cancer coming back.

PATIENT X636
Well they.

DOCTOR X636
Colon cancer takes ten years to develop.  That's why we say when you turn 50 get one.

PATIENT X636
Right.

DOCTOR X636
That's how long it takes the polyps to become a cancer.

PATIENT X636
But they.

DOCTOR X636
The only thing, I'm sorry.

PATIENT X636
Sure.

DOCTOR X636
The other thing is that the @@@ if they found little blood vessels, sometimes you just get here and there you know if you're on prednisone and that kind of thing, you could be bleeding still from that.  The other thing is I don't know exactly what they took out.  Iron is absorbed in the far part of the small bowel, near to the colon @@@.

PATIENT X636
Right.

DOCTOR X636
So sometimes you see colectomies and they end up taking a part of the small bowel @@@.  So that's kind of three good reasons why you might be a little anemic.  But as long as you're not getting dizzy, you're not having chest pain, your blood count's really not that low, kind of low grade anemia.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
I'm not super worried about it.  Um the other thing I wanted to do is, they diagnosed you with an iron deficiency but they didn't look to see how much iron the body stored up.

PATIENT X636
Alright.

DOCTOR X636
I'd like to see that cause sometimes when people have things @@@ stress, any kind of disease, your body stockpiles iron.

PATIENT X636
And you know what.

DOCTOR X636
Cause it doesn't want the blood @@@.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
@@@ then every year now it happens.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
Then all of a sudden I have @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
And they look at one thing and by the time they started looking in there, there's no place, they can't find @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Right.

PATIENT X636
It could be @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Inside my intestine.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah cause those @@@ and they're real annoying to try to find cause they'll bleed for a little bit then they'll stop.

PATIENT X636
Hmm.

DOCTOR X636
And they're not able to @@@.

PATIENT X636
Well I guess we're just gonna have to keep an eye on it.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Cause I know it's gonna happen again.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Cause I've had that every year for the last three years.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
@@@.

PATIENT X636
Probably gonna happen again unless you give me something to stop it.

DOCTOR X636
Well we'll give you iron to get your blood storage up.

PATIENT X636
Yeah @@@ iron.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Anything else bothering you aside from the anemia?

PATIENT X636
I'm very weak.  Cause I've been home.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I lost my appetite.  I lost, once I was 175 pounds, I'm down to 167 pounds.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I mean I love to eat.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
And she'll take me, I like to eat at restaurants.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
So we eat out a lot.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
And I get my favorite things.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
And @@@.

DOCTOR X636
What's your favorite foods?

PATIENT X636
Anything with grease and fat in it.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X636
Anything that's fried.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.  Does he live with you?

SECOND PERSON X636
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Okay, okay, alright.  Um well that's kind of a vague complaint.  Sometimes when you're your age um being in the hospital can also take you out um.

PATIENT X636
Usually when I go to the hospital when I didn't know if I was going to @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And it's bothering me.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
To the point where I've been losing sleep and I keep thinking, it's not worth it, is this it?

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.  Your diabetes panel was really low.  Um that can't really explain about the stabbing sort of pain you get.  You might have back spasms, a lot of people do have.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Arthritis and stuff but I'm really happy that you're not, that you know come and see me, I don't want you falling down or anything @@@.

PATIENT X636
You know I had stones in my bladder?

SECOND PERSON X636
Gallbladder.

DOCTOR X636
Oh that's okay.

PATIENT X636
And they, that would be they scheduled me for surgery and I talked to the surgery and @@@ diet and medications.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And he never called me.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
So instead my doctor gave me enough medications to resolve the stones.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah, yeah.  Generally with gallstones if they don't bother you they don't bother us as a general rule and like you're right a surgeon never wants somebody to go into surgery if they're not gonna definitely survive afterwards.

PATIENT X636
And the fact that he couldn't go in, @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Oh it was laparoscopic?

PATIENT X636
Yeah, he couldn't do that.

DOCTOR X636
Oh.

PATIENT X636
But he said he had to go in because of the cancer I had surgery.

DOCTOR X636
Oh okay.

PATIENT X636
And they had to go in and open it.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
But my doctor didn't want to do it.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And uh and.

SECOND PERSON X636
@@@.

PATIENT X636
I have to tell you one other thing because that's a couple of years.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And uh I know I've been that way for years and I just couldn't take it.

DOCTOR X636
Is this gallbladder pain?

PATIENT X636
Once in a while I get a lot of pain.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And you know they said well if it goes to the back then you've got to worry about it.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah, you're supposed to go to the @@@.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
So I wouldn't worry about that.  If you start getting fevers and chills and sweats that when we worry.

PATIENT X636
Oh that, okay.

DOCTOR X636
Because something could get infected but again if they don't bother you they don't bother me.

PATIENT X636
Well can you give me that prescription?

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
Yeah I usually call it in for the first thing but the number on there @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah this has been refilled.

PATIENT X636
@@@.  That's all I got.

DOCTOR X636
Oh for your blood sugars?

PATIENT X636
I need refills you know.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I need to get them.

DOCTOR X636
Do you get them here?

PATIENT X636
They um get them from the outside so.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
The only other time that I came in here uh that was to the hospital and they gave them to me.

DOCTOR X636
Okay they gave you these kinds and they worked?

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Okay cause they contract with of course one glucometer maker, one you know what I mean.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
There are about a billion glucometer makers.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
@@@.

PATIENT X636
I don't know if the VA gave me that or the @@@.  But I think I might as well today from here.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah absolutely.

SECOND PERSON X636
Cause @@@.

PATIENT X636
Yeah I can have a renewal.

DOCTOR X636
Let me just make sure it's compatible you know.  I should be able to look it up.  Do you like it to go to your house or do you want to pick it up at the window?

PATIENT X636
No I better pick it up cause that's all I have.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
Both medications I have to take home.

DOCTOR X636
Okay you've been on this for a while right?

PATIENT X636
Both of them.

DOCTOR X636
Okay just to make your co-pay simpler I'll give you a 90 day supply.

PATIENT X636
Right.

DOCTOR X636
With three refills and then I'll see you in six months but I'll give you my card and everything if you need to see me before then.

PATIENT X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
Um.

SECOND PERSON X636
So you'll still be here in six months?

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
I know, we change you know cause this is like an apprenticeship.  I've been in medical school and I have an MD and all that stuff but um I'm getting tweaked you know.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
So I always practice under somebody but it's a.

PATIENT X636
Actually yeah they're recording me, the conversation.

DOCTOR X636
Oh really?  Did they tell you?

PATIENT X636
Yeah it's in my jacket I don't even know if you can @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Oh that's good to know.

PATIENT X636
If it picks it up.

DOCTOR X636
They've been doing it.  I mean that's really funny.

PATIENT X636
That's why I told you that you're @@@ be on Candid Camera.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah, yeah I wondered.  So you only have precision um not free style, you know what I mean so I don't know if they're gonna be compatible.

PATIENT X636
It's the same thing all over yeah.  Cause I.  You know what I could do is that I had @@@ for years, I wonder if I could get any more.

DOCTOR X636
Uh does it work okay?

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
It's beginning to get a lot of errors on it.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
It's like I was talking to someone the other day on the phone, they wanted to give me a new machine.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
And she said you know those machines don't last forever.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And it works for years.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And you should think about replacing it.

DOCTOR X636
So what I'll do is, if you're concerned about it anyway it might be a good time just to give you the Precision brand strips to just give you a Precision brand.

PATIENT X636
Right, right.

DOCTOR X636
So we can give you that.  Other medications I have you on, let's see here.

PATIENT X636

SECOND PERSON X636

DOCTOR X636
Um when you came out of the hospital they said that your magnesium and it was really low.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
When it came so that can cause sometimes a cramping in the legs and a sensation of weakness.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
The magnesium I don't want to keep you too long on it.

PATIENT X636
Could you give me for my cramps I used to @@@ and they used to give me, what was it, uh some kind of medication for cramps.

DOCTOR X636
Oh I don't know that could be anything.

PATIENT X636
It was called, I can't remember it, but I used to keep a supply of it all the time and I had it, like I say that's the reason why I get cramps in the legs.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
And I'd get up and walk around.

SECOND PERSON X636
The stool softener, he has one bottle but there's no more refills.

PATIENT X636
But I could call it in for a refill.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
But there's no refills.
DOCTOR X636
No I know, I can go through everything to make sure you have plenty of refills.

PATIENT X636
Oh yeah, yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
Iron uh there's no refill on it.

DOCTOR X636
No refills on iron, okay.

PATIENT X636
Can we get it?

SECOND PERSON X636
On that either and we don't have, there's no extra on that one.

DOCTOR X636
Did you want that today too?

PATIENT X636
We have enough.

SECOND PERSON X636
No we still have enough for um, let me see here, three four, okay.

DOCTOR X636
I'll make sure you have plenty so you know call us about two weeks before you run out.

PATIENT X636
Alright.

DOCTOR X636
But I'll look through all the medications and make sure you have enough refills.

SECOND PERSON X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I know they have a number you have to call in and they'll send the medications but I don't have the number.

SECOND PERSON X636
But you need the refills.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
Cause those, your blood pressure ones you only have one more refill.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Now are you having any chest pain or shortness of breath?  I know, well you told me a little bit about that.

PATIENT X636
Yeah I had a little bit of it, like I say it came back again but it's not as severe like it was before.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Is this the same kind of chest pain?

PATIENT X636
Yeah.  It's not a pain it's like, it's kind of like I'm running out of breath.

DOCTOR X636
Like a tightening you said is the word you used yeah.

PATIENT X636
Yeah I feel like it's, it's @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea?

PATIENT X636
No.

DOCTOR X636
You've had no blood in your stool?

PATIENT X636
My stomach has always been bad and I've got all kinds of medications for that.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Are you moving your bowels okay @@@?

PATIENT X636
Yeah but I have to take something for it.

DOCTOR X636
Okay, that's okay.

PATIENT X636
That they gave me.

DOCTOR X636
As long as we got you to a good place.

PATIENT X636
Dark black stools are caused by the medications.

DOCTOR X636
The iron.

PATIENT X636
The iron.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah iron will tend to bind you up too so make sure you're taking the stool softener.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Any trouble passing water?

PATIENT X636
No.

DOCTOR X636
Good okay.

PATIENT X636
Nothing to talk about.

DOCTOR X636
Okay and you said before you feel like your legs are gonna go out you feel it, you can grab yourself.  You're not falling down or passing out?

PATIENT X636
No, no, no.  Not, @@@.  If I get up in the middle of the night I got a lot of light from the street and from the alley.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
My apartment is lit.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
But I do get up and walk to the bathroom.

DOCTOR X636
Good.

PATIENT X636
But I have to be very careful.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah definitely, definitely.

PATIENT X636
But usually I just take the walker.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.  Um @@@.  Good.  Let me just look.

PATIENT X636
I @@@.

DOCTOR X636
It's a little red.  I'm going to just, go ahead and close your mouth, close your mouth.  @@@.  It's a little red but it's not like @@@.  It's just red.  

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Does it, how often @@@.

PATIENT X636
No I thought it was arthritis.  It probably something @@@ but mouth it could be just very dry.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
And that helps.

DOCTOR X636
Any pain up this way?

PATIENT X636
No, no.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  I've seen a throat like that sometimes in patients that get sinus trouble.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
That's why I was asking you about a cough and stuff like that but of course with you having the asthma so you normally cough anyway right.

PATIENT X636
Right.

DOCTOR X636
So it's gonna be hard to say.  The other thing is sometimes patients will get sensations of reflux.

PATIENT X636
I have reflux anyway.

DOCTOR X636
And that would also.

PATIENT X636
Well I got to get a refill of the reflux medication.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Are you having any trouble with reflux now?

PATIENT X636
No.

DOCTOR X636
Okay cause yeah usually a lot of patients.

SECOND PERSON X636
@@@ he has @@@.

DOCTOR X636
That's yeah.

PATIENT X636
I ran out of it, so I got to keep @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah so no even though it's @@@ on a full stomach usually three hours, wait about three hours um, things like chocolate will really irritate some people.  Some people will say that they have trouble with like tomato sauces but they can eat a fresh tomato without trouble.  Um alcohol of course.  A glass of red wine is good for you and even a beer once in a while is good for you, but too much alcohol @@@.

PATIENT X636
What did you say about @@@.

DOCTOR X636
What do you mean?

PATIENT X636
One glass of the red wine.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
@@@ when I was in the hospital.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
And they were concerned about that because @@@ on the right.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
Wasn't bad but they said that would have to go up into your groin.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
But that's okay.

DOCTOR X636
Well usually most of the clots, so if you have clots in the legs they're gonna go to the lungs so those can kill you.  @@@ and heart both can kill you.  Most the clots actually form in the @@@.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
And then they travel down and @@@.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
But you have a filter in.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah so we just have to wait for your body to break down that clot naturally.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Sometimes when you have things like @@@ and you have a lot of autoimmune diseases or you don't move around a lot, it's hard for your body to break those clots.

PATIENT X636
It's not @@@ cause you're not going out you know and fall and break a leg.

DOCTOR X636
Right.

PATIENT X636
So now I'm confined to the house.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
I you know I had to get up and walk.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
So haven't done anything except like that, just inside the house.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
But I got a bicycle.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
You know.

SECOND PERSON X636
He hasn't really been alone since Thanksgiving.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X636
Cause he caught a bad cold.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
And all winter he just couldn't get rid of it.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
And he'd get a little better and then he'd get you know sick again.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X636
A little better and then get real sick again.

PATIENT X636
I just haven't been myself.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
For the last couple months @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I don't know what I'd without kids around me.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah, doctor's order, that's a pretty good indication.  But yeah I think.  Cause that's a hard thing to really pinpoint you know.  Not feeling good like that.  I think um there are a couple of reasons @@@ in the mix you know.  But you've been that anemic for a while so, you'd think your body would have adjusted.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
I can hear you, like your daughter said, wheezing quite a bit so you might be hanging on to a cold.

PATIENT X636
I just got over it.

DOCTOR X636
A little longer.

PATIENT X636
Right.  I had a cold with the asthma.

DOCTOR X636
And what I don't like is the losing weight you know.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Um.

PATIENT X636
Well you know I think I've lost the weight because.

SECOND PERSON X636
Um he has been recently.

PATIENT X636
I'm starting.

SECOND PERSON X636
In the hospital.

PATIENT X636
When I was in the hospital I couldn't stand the food that they gave me for one thing.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
I wasn't hungry either.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
And I went home and like I say I used to my favorite foods.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
But what I'm saying but once I @@@ could eat it.

DOCTOR X636
In the hospital you weighed 167, so you've really only lost like three or four pounds which I mean can be you know, it's not really much.  

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
But when you were telling me you used to be in the 170s, you've lost about 10 pounds.

PATIENT X636
Yeah @@@.

SECOND PERSON J257
I thinking he might just come out of this.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X636
And like I said because of my cold I got the, then they gave me my old @@@.

DOCTOR X636
You were 175 in November so I mean that's actually less than.

SECOND PERSON X636
Oh it was less than ten?

DOCTOR X636
Yeah it's about, I would say in about six months you lost about ten pounds.

PATIENT X636
10 pounds.

DOCTOR X636
That's not so much where I really, really worry.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
But we ought to keep an eye on it okay and make sure you're getting good nutrition.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Also once the weather starts get up and get out and get moving.

PATIENT X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
We'll draw your labs today to make sure your electrolytes aren't out of whack and just to make sure you're not too anemic.

SECOND PERSON X636
He had breakfast.

DOCTOR X636
Oh that's fine, yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
That doesn't matter?

DOCTOR X636
No that doesn't matter.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X636
They can check the, what's that lab test the blood count?

DOCTOR X636
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X636
The iron, magnesium, potassium.

DOCTOR X636
So what I'm gonna check are the magnesium, potassium, do the panel where we check the kidney function level.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
I'm gonna do that.  I'll check the blood count.  I'm not gonna check the iron level cause they checked that last time but I'm gonna check how the body stores his iron.

SECOND PERSON X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
Um because sometimes you know that can affect how much iron your body is able to use.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
It's kind of hard to explain but um it actually when you have a lot of inflammation for one reason or the other the stored @@@ is enough to account for that.  Um our body automatically thinks we have an infection you know which is kind of actually if you have an infection, the bacteria just loves iron, that's what they live on.

SECOND PERSON X636
Hmm.

DOCTOR X636
So your body just kind of collects iron.  So sometimes we can see patients with really low iron in the blood, not because they're not getting it, not because they're not absorbing it, not because they're losing it but rather your body's trying to collect it sort of as a protective mechanism because through evolution you know it's what we tell people, thousands of years ago, hunters used to get infection right.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Now we've gotten to the point where we've got antibiotics and all these things where you wash your hands but our body still thinks infection whenever there's a problem.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
So we check the iron stores and the electrolytes.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
And we'll just make sure there's nothing reported in the blood count, make sure there's nothing out of whack.  I'll make sure I have a phone number to contact you.

SECOND PERSON X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
Um so I'll let you know if there's any trouble.  Um we'll make sure you have enough refills, I'll see you in six months.  I'll give you my card you know so if you need to see me sooner and we'll give you, I already put in the ursodiol and the Precision monitor at the window.

SECOND PERSON X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
You should be able to pick those up whenever.

PATIENT X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
And I'll need to take a listen to your heart and your lungs.

PATIENT X636
Oh, do you want me to get up there?

DOCTOR X636
On no you're okay there, that's fine.  With your mouth open deep breaths in.  Yeah you're kind of wheezy.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Good.  Deep breath in for me.  Can you just sit up on the table for me so I can poke on your stomach?

SECOND PERSON X636
He's a little tough today feeling real dizzy and it's just like he's coming down with a cold.  So that's probably what it is.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah I mean, it's kind of the time for summer colds you know we're getting into that season where the summer viruses are coming.

SECOND PERSON X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
I'm sorry to interrupt I keep getting paged, I'm just gonna see who's paging me.  So alright, I need to check your feet.  Yeah @@@.  Is there anybody in the house with you to help him?

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh my brother comes down.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  (Doctor makes a phone call paging another doctor)  Your brother comes by?

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh yeah.  Yeah uh.

DOCTOR X636
Whoops sorry.

SECOND PERSON X636
@@@ if he does walk around you know he'll stumble, he stumbles.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
And you know he'll just.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
Catch himself.

PATIENT X636
I have to use the walker.

DOCTOR X636
You use a walker, do you have one at home?

PATIENT X636
Yeah.  When I'm walking and things like that, I had to start using the walker when @@@ to the other.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I use the walker.

DOCTOR X636
Can you feel your feet?  Like can you feel me touching you?

PATIENT X636
Yes.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  And do ever recall besides having that pain, you know you said you get like a sharp kind of stabbing pain sometimes in the back.  You ever fall apart from that?

PATIENT X636
The pain on the back?

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
That's @@@ the back.

DOCTOR X636
Right and does that what makes you stumble?

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Does anything else make you stumble?

PATIENT X636
I think that's about the only pain cause it's around my back.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.
SECOND PERSON X636
It's the pain that he gets.

PATIENT X636
@@@.  As a matter of fact one time it was so bad that I couldn't even walk.  She had to bring me into the hospital.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I mean, I just took a bone density test.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
Just this week.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I don't know what the results were.

DOCTOR X636
Did you get it here?

PATIENT X636
I did it, yeah.

DOCTOR X636
So are you having any back pain now?

PATIENT X636
Always, always.  It's constant.  If it's severe I can’t stand it, it'll knock you down.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
If I step on it and put weight on it and the pain is there, I'm going to fall and then I grab something.

DOCTOR X636
So you have osteoporosis.

PATIENT X636
Oh.

DOCTOR X636
And all that means is your bones aren't very dense.  Your bones are normal they're just not very dense.  Um do you take calcium?

PATIENT X636
Hmm.

DOCTOR X636
With vitamin D?

PATIENT X636
Uh if I take it.

DOCTOR X636
@@@.

PATIENT X636
I take it yeah, @@@ supposed to be three.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
But I take it two times a day.

DOCTOR X636
Okay so you know those commercials with xxx xxx?

SECOND PERSON X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
Um usually that's another osteoporosis medicine we put people on sometimes.  Um the reason we worry about osteoporosis is it doesn't in and of itself cause pain.  Most people don't even know they have it but if you do take a spill you're more prone to fractures, that's the problem.  So usually the number one fracture that people with osteoporosis get is they get compression fractures of the back so that may account for the back pain.  I don't know if you have it anywhere else.

SECOND PERSON X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah you told me @@@.  I'm not sure um.

SECOND PERSON X636
It just says calcium carbonate, it doesn't say if it has vitamin D or not.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.

PATIENT X636
I think it's in the fine print.

DOCTOR X636
You have some scoliosis in there too um.

PATIENT X636
Yeah. 

DOCTOR X636
So you're probably looking at you know that problem.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR, he's my boss.

PATIENT X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
And then we'll touch base.  I'll see if she has any suggestions about osteoporosis in terms of either adding.  The calcium carbonate, usually they make calcium and vitamin D together @@@.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
Do I take it once a day?

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Vitamin D pushes the calcium in the @@@ but I'll be right back.

PATIENT X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
Get more comfortable.

PATIENT X636
Okay I'll better sit back and move.

DOCTOR X636
Just kind of be careful.

PATIENT X636
Alright.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  I'll be back in just a little bit okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  51:40  DOCTOR IN:  61:24)

DOCTOR X636
Alright, sorry to keep you guys waiting so long.

PATIENT X636
Alright.

DOCTOR X636
Um so let's do this um your ursodiol that you take for the bladder stones rather um and the test strips and the meter are waiting for you.

PATIENT X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
So stop and pick those up.  We'll do some labs like we talked about.  Um do you have a phone number I can reach you at?

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh yes uh NUMBER.

PATIENT X636
That's your cell.

SECOND PERSON X636
That's the cell.

DOCTOR X636
Okay I'll call you when the labs get back so probably, I'll call you by next week.

SECOND PERSON X636
Let me give you my father’s number.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X636
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  I'll call you um if there's anything wrong of course I'll call you right away but I'll call you by next week irrespective just to let you know um you know.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
I'm gonna check a couple things, you know just general like we talked about and just make sure there's nothing else going on.  I don't like to leave things.  We'll start you on the one new medication too, the daily @@@ medication the alendronate @@@.

PATIENT X636
@@@.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah cause we're at the point where I don't think calcium and vitamin D are enough.  I don't like to put people on medicine unless they need it but your osteoporosis is pretty bad.  What we do is they have a score measure you know how dense your bones are and yours are pretty brittle so you got to be careful okay.

PATIENT X636
So this medication is whatever you were talking about that combines the calcium?

DOCTOR X636
No calcium and vitamin D is one thing.

PATIENT X636
Oh.

DOCTOR X636
Which you should be on anyway.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Um which I'm.

SECOND PERSON X636
Are you going to change this calcium to.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECOND PERSON X636
Change the calcium.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.  He needs @@@.  I don't know why they would put him on just calcium carbonate um.

PATIENT X636
Is that @@@.

SECOND PERSON X636
Uh I think we just had it filled.

DOCTOR X636
Okay.  Well I mean what could you always do is I can give you a vitamin D supplement separate, you can go to Walgreen’s and get a cheap vitamin D supplement next time, would you want me to do that and then just use up the calcium?

SECOND PERSON X636
Hmm.

DOCTOR X636
Okay I'll see if we have them here but I think it's important to just put @@@ alendronate which is one tablet a day.

PATIENT X636
Hmm.

DOCTOR X636
Okay and then we're gonna repeat that test.

SECOND PERSON X636
And the side effects of it is?

DOCTOR X636
Um in cancer patients they found trouble with um, with the bones of the jaw.  Sometimes people have trouble swallowing um but apart from that it's a very good drug.  So if you look it up I mean chances are of side effects those are the big ones to worry about but more of the side effects like I said were @@@ with the jaw and the chance of it @@@ in cancer patients and you have to remove the bones.  Um very rare but esophageal, you're esophagus next to your mouth, your stomach.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
You can have some esophageal narrowing um so this is a very rare side effect.  Those are the two major ones we watch out for.  People sometimes will get nausea and vomiting @@@ shortness of breath @@@.  Sometimes it can cause some stomach upset um so you can let me know if that happens but other than that.

PATIENT X636
I have my trouble with my gums.

SECOND PERSON X636
Yeah that's one thing @@@.

DOCTOR X636
Like the reflux.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
That's different than what this causes um.  Reflux the best thing is @@@ and not eating three hours before you go to bed.  Sometimes if people have a lot of trouble they will put their bed up on cinder blocks, not necessary a lot of pillows but put the actual top, you know what I mean, the two posts that are close to the wall.

PATIENT X636
I might.  They told me that for years.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.  Um those are the best things to do for it and if that doesn't work you know there's always medication which I believe.

PATIENT X636
Yeah I'm taking.

DOCTOR X636
You're on omeprazole which is the strongest one made.

PATIENT X636
I'm taking it in the morning.  Maybe I could take it in the evening.

DOCTOR X636
Technically 24 hour drugs it shouldn't matter.

PATIENT X636
Oh.

DOCTOR X636
You know.

PATIENT X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
But watch the tomato sauce, watch the chocolate.

PATIENT X636
Yeah.

DOCTOR X636
And all the stuff you like to do cause you said @@@.

PATIENT X636
I had @@@ all the list of my medications.

DOCTOR X636
All the @@@ things yeah.

PATIENT X636
@@@.  They told me to put it in my vest.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

PATIENT X636
I have more pockets than I like.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah so.

PATIENT X636
She said moderation, moderation.

DOCTOR X636
Right yeah.  Well I understand reflux can cause problems but at the point you're at I'm not worry about it; it's more just symptoms you know.

PATIENT X636
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X636
Um if you want to hold off on the alendronate, the medication I think that that, you know I can understand your reasons you don't want to take another drug but I also don't want you falling down and getting a fracture which would be really terrible.

PATIENT X636
And I'm hoping that you know this will help with getting out, I have to get rid of it one way or, maybe if I start to exercising.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah I think that that's important to helping getting out.

SECOND PERSON X636
What did she say about continuing @@@ that it could be caused from @@@.

DOCTOR X636
We can just talk @@@.

SECOND PERSON X636
I know that he had something with the iron.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah so you could be iron deficient and uh just giving you iron might not be helping much so I'm gonna check the body's iron storage with the blood test.

SECOND PERSON X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
You know um we should.  It's such a vague complaint, it's real hard you know so.  For some things we look for um, for some things it's kind of you know it can be caused from anything from just plain old @@@ and like you said hanging on to a cold for a little period but there's nothing in his labs to make me think that there's something real serious going on but we'll repeat some labs today just to make sure since the last time I checked the other labs.

PATIENT X636
Right now you want me to go to the Lab, so this is for a vitamin deficiency and stuff like that?

DOCTOR X636
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X636
Okay.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.  Any questions for me?  I know we went through a lot and we spent a lot of time.

PATIENT X636
No, that's what usually happens, thank God, you know.

DOCTOR X636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X636
It uh, every time I come in I have nothing planned.  I have no complaint about the VA they treat me like a million bucks and they have, well like I got a stroke, what they called going on vacation one year and I got a stroke while I was there and what hospital do you want to go, oh I said there's only one hospital that I can be with here in California just because it's the VA and they took me there.

DOCTOR X636
Yeah.

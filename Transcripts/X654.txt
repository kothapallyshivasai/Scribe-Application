DOCTOR X654 
How are you today?

PATIENT X654
Hello.

DOCTOR X654
Never mind the skin @@@.

PATIENT X654
@@@.

DOCTOR X654
How you doing?  Alright.  Okay, so how you been since the last time we saw you?  Looks like it's been since February.

PATIENT X654
Yeah, alright.

DOCTOR X654
Doing alright?

PATIENT X654
Yeah.

DOCTOR X654
Good.  Um yeah I was just looking at the last note uh; we wanted to check a uric acid level in your blood.

PATIENT X654
Right.

DOCTOR X654
For your gout and it was a little elevated.  Uh we like to see it around 6 or less.  Yours was at 7.5.  When's the last time, when's the last time you've had a gout flare do you remember?

PATIENT X654
It was back in the wintertime.

DOCTOR X654
Back in the wintertime.

PATIENT X654
Yeah.

DOCTOR X654
Okay.  How many do you think you have a year, like on bad years, how many gout flares did you think you have?

PATIENT X654
I have, what I'm finding out now is that uh it all depends on what I eat.  If I half way eat right it don't bother me.

DOCTOR X654
Okay.

PATIENT X654
So I would say maybe two.

DOCTOR X654
Okay.  That's not bad.

PATIENT X654
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X654
The reason I ask is that um you know when you start to get to three gouty flares a year that's when we start to think about preventative medicines that help reduce the level of uric acid in the blood.

PATIENT X654
Right.

DOCTOR X654
Just to prevent but if you think you can manage your gout flares with just diet modification then we may not need to do that.  What do you think?

PATIENT X654
I think I can.

DOCTOR X654
You think you can do that?

PATIENT X654
Okay.  As long as it's taken, what they do is that you know before you gout flare-up.

DOCTOR X654
Right, right and you have some colchicine at home?  Do you have some pills if you have a flare to take?  Like just in case?

PATIENT X654
Uh I don't think so.

DOCTOR X654
Two pills, 0.6 mg, real small.

PATIENT X654
I don't think so.

DOCTOR X654
Okay that might be a good thing.  What did you take the last time you had a flare?

PATIENT X654
Shit I don't remember.

DOCTOR X654
Did you go to the ER?

PATIENT X654
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X654
Have you been able to cut back on your smoking at all?

PATIENT X654
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X654
Good what are you back to?

PATIENT X654
A pack or less than a pack.

DOCTOR X654
From a half a pack?  That is good and as far as your medications go how are you doing on your medications?

PATIENT X654
Alright.

DOCTOR X654
Yeah your blood pressure's really good today.

PATIENT X654
Yeah.

DOCTOR X654
So we don’t need to make any changes.  Do you get your meds filled at another hospital or outside?

PATIENT X654
Walgreens.

DOCTOR X654
At Walgreens.  Do you have enough refills?

PATIENT X654
Uh I don't even know.  

DOCTOR X654
I'll check.

PATIENT X654
I think I do because they uh, the last doctor put uh.

DOCTOR X654
A year, good.

PATIENT X654
I @@@.

DOCTOR X654
Alright well, yeah @@@.  How's your knee doing?

PATIENT X654
Doing great so far.  It hasn't bugged me but I got a question to ask you.

DOCTOR X654
Sure.

PATIENT X654
Uh like uh I know if I'm having sex or something I don't rise.  If I take Viagra I still don't rise.

DOCTOR X654
Oh okay.  Uh and you're taking the 100 mg tablets?

PATIENT X654
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X654
Do you want to try a different one like Cialis?

PATIENT X654
Do you think that would uh?

DOCTOR X654
Yeah I think people have been having pretty good luck with that one.

PATIENT X654
Yeah.

DOCTOR X654
You want to try that instead?

PATIENT X654
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X654
Okay.  We'll try a higher dose of the, you want to get it through the VA or do you want to get it at Walgreens?

PATIENT X654
Do they fill them here?

DOCTOR X654
Yeah but they only give you like two a month.  Is that enough for you?  It's free.  They're expensive that's why I asked.  So you could try, you could do the two a month and see if that worked.

PATIENT X654
Okay.

DOCTOR X654
And if you want we can get you more.

PATIENT X654
You said they expensive so I want them from here.

DOCTOR X654
Yeah.  They're expensive, yeah they're expensive.  I mean I can write you a prescription and you can get as many as you want at Walgreens.

PATIENT X654
No.

DOCTOR X654
Fair enough.

PATIENT X654
No.

DOCTOR X654
They're not cheap.

PATIENT X654
I know cause the @@@ real expensive.

DOCTOR X654
Yeah and don't take, you now don't take the two of them.

PATIENT X654
No.

DOCTOR X654
Cause they can drop your blood pressure.

PATIENT X654
No.

DOCTOR X654
Just take the one or the other.  Alright.  Its Levitra actually is the one we have and the high dose of it is 20 mg tablet usually works with people so we'll do that okay.

PATIENT X654
I hope it works so I can enjoy some finally.

DOCTOR X654
I know, I know.  I got to get you to quit smoking though too, that's gonna make a difference.

PATIENT X654
Yeah.

DOCTOR X654
You know.  The blood vessels.  The blood vessels just like they go to the heart you know and they get hardened and clogged they don't, things don't work as well.  Well we'll try this and see.  I've had more patients who've had pretty good luck with the high doses of this.  Alright.  Deep breath.  Okay, very good.  Let me talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X654
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  13:46  DOCTOR IN:  16:46)

DOCTOR X654
Okay.  So I'm gonna write you a prescription as well for a medicine that's called colchicine.  It's one of the oldest medications on record.  They've using it to treat gout for centuries so uh the way it works is if you have a flare in your toe, knees, whatever, um you take one of the pills and then you can take another one an hour later but just take a couple of them.  Use it as directed.  Um and that might save you a trip to the Emergency Room if you have a flare.  It's just a nice thing to have.  Now the pill has gone up in price so I'm gonna fill it if you want to get it, get it but I'm not exactly sure what the VA's markup is.  

PATIENT X654
I don't want to get that from here.

DOCTOR X654
You want to get that from.

PATIENT X654
Walgreens.

DOCTOR X654
From Walgreens.

PATIENT X654
Yeah.  See my prescriptions is way cheaper at Walgreens than they are here.

DOCTOR X654
Is that right?

PATIENT X654
But for Viagra and stuff like that they charge something separate.  

DOCTOR X654
What kind of insurance do you have?

PATIENT X654
Uh Medicaid.

DOCTOR X654
Oh okay.  So only take three of these tablets, but you can take them once an hour.

PATIENT X654
Right.

DOCTOR X654
It usually does the trick.  You'll come back and see us in four months.  Is that okay with you?

PATIENT X654
Yeah.

DOCTOR X654
Alright.  That should be all.  Pick them up at the Pharmacy and actually they'll mail those other pills to you and these you can just pick up at the window.  

PATIENT X654
Yeah I'm gonna pick them up at the Pharmacy.

DOCTOR X654
Pick them up there.

PATIENT X654
Sure yeah.

DOCTOR X654
It's in the computer, just give me a minute.

PATIENT X654
Okay.  Thanks you.

DOCTOR X654
Take care.

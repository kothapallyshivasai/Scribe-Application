PATIENT X451
Excellent, excellent.

DOCTOR X451
Excellent.

PATIENT X451
We're doing 502 games last year.

DOCTOR X451

DOCTOR X451
Gee.

PATIENT X451
And you may be able to see that my blood pressure is down.

DOCTOR X451
Yes.

PATIENT X451
I don't want those cholesterol pills we were talking about.

DOCTOR X451
You don't want them?

PATIENT X451
No thanks.

DOCTOR X451
I thought I @@@ off them.

PATIENT X451
Well you told me you put me on something else too.  I thought if I didn't get my cholesterol down yeah.

DOCTOR X451
Yeah.  Did you start taking that other medicine though?

PATIENT X451
Yeah I started taking it but I didn't continue.

DOCTOR X451
Oh so I did two things last time.  I increased your blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT X451
Yes.

DOCTOR X451
So you've been taking that increased dose?

PATIENT X451
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X451
And then you didn't take the cholesterol medicine?

PATIENT X451
No.  They started just making me feel kind of bad at first so.

DOCTOR X451
In what way?

PATIENT X451
Just kind of out of sorts.

DOCTOR X451
Okay.  I wish I'd come last week.  I was even lighter.  I was down to 183 last week.

PATIENT X451
You were, oh yeah you lost since the last time I saw you.

DOCTOR X451
Yes sir.  Well losing weight, you probably don't need that medicine then.

PATIENT X451
I'm just living a little better.

DOCTOR X451
Good.

PATIENT X451
My buddy NAME comes over.  I stopped him from coming over with that halftime juice.

DOCTOR X451
Not fun without alcohol?

PATIENT X451
No fun no, no.  Having one game and one of the kids asked me hey ref uh whose ball is that so at the time I said whose balls and I thought I don't know, so I had to go ask my partner whose ball is it?  And I said uh uh that's it.  You know when you really kind of a nondrinker you shouldn't mess with stuff like jam.

DOCTOR X451
Yeah it's better not to drink.

PATIENT X451
Dinner wine is okay?

DOCTOR X451
Huh, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
How's the knee going?

PATIENT X451
Oh about the same.

DOCTOR X451
How often are you using the pain med?

PATIENT X451
Uh oh probably once a week.

DOCTOR X451
Okay.

PATIENT X451
And then my prescription ran out.  I was so surprised I went on to my Healthy Vet to order the naproxen and it was not there anymore.

DOCTOR X451
Alright.  I'll see if we can renew it.

PATIENT X451
Now I understand.

DOCTOR X451
How many, so you're taking it once a week.  How many pills do you usually take, is it like once a week?

PATIENT X451
Uh at least two and sometime I take two every four or six hours and if I keep that up for a day or so, maybe a day and a half I don't have any problem for a few weeks.

DOCTOR X451
So. The naproxen when you go back to @@@ take that twice a day.  And don't drink too much okay.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
I mean don't take any more because it could hurt your kidneys.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
Alright and not and it's not like kidney @@@.  If you need more, just take the Tylenol or something with it then okay.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
But the naproxen take it twice a day or if you want to take it.

PATIENT X451
Well I don't take it every day.

DOCTOR X451
I know, I know, but when you do, just take it twice.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
And it lasts a long time.

PATIENT X451
It does.

DOCTOR X451
That's why I requested it.  If you wanted something more often you can just take regular Advil or ibuprofen or something.

PATIENT X451
That's what I've been doing, since I been out of this for.

DOCTOR X451
Has that been working?

PATIENT X451
A couple of months.

DOCTOR X451
Ibuprofen.

PATIENT X451
Yeah.

DOCTOR X451
Okay, so let's keep doing that then okay.

PATIENT X451
Well actually I haven't been taking, what's the brand name for naproxen?

DOCTOR X451
Aleve.

PATIENT X451
Aleve.

DOCTOR X451
Oh I see, so you can take that twice a day.  You want me to give you some Tylenol or something, try that.  @@@.  You need refills on any other meds?

PATIENT X451
Yes.  Uh my blood pressure medicines I probably got at least another month, close to a month on those.  Uh happy pills, I've been out for a long time of those.

DOCTOR X451
You need more?

PATIENT X451
Yeah.

DOCTOR X451
Take off your jacket for me.  Can you stiffen the arm for one second?  Deep breath.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, no other problems, @@@ bowel problems?

PATIENT X451
Well you know I @@@.

DOCTOR X451
Alright.

PATIENT X451
And at one point I was seeing some blood until I found out that I had scratched myself with some itching and it wasn't coming from @@@ it was on the outside.

DOCTOR X451
Were straining a lot?

PATIENT X451
I was yeah, yeah.  I've been straining a lot, yeah.  Yeah that's kind of a common thing with hemorrhage.

DOCTOR X451
Do you have a lot of fiber in your diet?

PATIENT X451
Probably all kinds of things.  I don't know that I eat much fiber.

DOCTOR X451
Then you need more fiber.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
You need to eat brown rice rather than white rice.

PATIENT X451
I do have some brown rice.

DOCTOR X451
So eat brown rice, that's better.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
Eat wheat bread instead of white better, that's a lot better.

PATIENT X451
Okay I'll start eating wheat bread.

DOCTOR X451
It's the kind of eating foods like vegetables, fruit, they all have fiber.

PATIENT X451
I eat a lot of fruit uh, a lot of vegetables and I have been eating a lot of tomatoes and cucumbers, almost daily and maybe @@@.  I kind of thought that was.  Well this is what's happened about @@@ and when it's time for me to go to the bathroom sometime it's so intense that I almost don't make it uh before it comes.

DOCTOR X451
How often do you go to the bathroom?  Do you know?

PATIENT X451
Four times a day at least and that's the normal and getting up all night.

DOCTOR X451
Having trouble urinating or?

PATIENT X451
Bowel movements.

DOCTOR X451
Four bowel movements a day?  I mean is it diarrhea or is it hard?

PATIENT X451
It's mixed.  It's not diarrhea.

DOCTOR X451
Well let me try you on a stool softener then to make sure you're not constipated.

PATIENT X451
You know I really don't feel constipated.  It's just I guess when I do go like, it's just I have to try to make sure that everything gets out.

DOCTOR X451
Don't do that okay.  Relax, don't strain. Straining will cause hemorrhoids and @@@ and then you get hemorrhoids and @@@ will cause fissures and then it really can go down @@@ okay.  So try to get a lot more fiber in your diet and then don't strain.

PATIENT X451
I @@@.

DOCTOR X451
Well you know anything that has high fiber.  You can even just take some fiber supplements if you want.  @@@ it's better to do that okay.  

PATIENT X451
Uh that's.

DOCTOR X451
Yeah no that's fine.

PATIENT X451
@@@ wanted to talk to you about there's so many times well actually a couple months ago I would take off my underwear and it's like you know I got kind of stains like I been leaking and I know I don't have a gallbladder anymore and it used to leak out uh and I don't know if that's from too much fat intake but I was told that's why.  I eat really low caffeine, no fat diet @@@.

DOCTOR X451
And you think you're making it to the bathroom whenever you go?

PATIENT X451
Generally I do but there have been some times, twice, three times that I didn't get there.

DOCTOR X451
Has this been going on for a long time?

PATIENT X451
I thought I could sit down.  Yes so I tried we we're going out to make sure if there's a bathroom I can use cause usually right after I eat uh I have to go sometimes within 15 minutes.

DOCTOR X451
If this has been going on @@@.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
@@@ too.

PATIENT X451
Well this has been going on probably since, so that's why I started regular @@@.

DOCTOR X451
Well let's do this, try to eat a lot more fiber.  Take, find some supplements and take them a couple times a day and if it's still happening next time we'll refer you to GI and they can do some testing and check your sphincter test and that kind of thing, if you're not as tight @@@.

PATIENT X451
Yeah.

DOCTOR X451
You don't control it as well.

PATIENT X451
Yeah that's what I was thinking.

DOCTOR X451
Any weakness or anything.  Problems urinating or anything like this?  So just try the fiber for now and I'll put in a stool softener here to try making it @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT X451
Alright.  @@@.  For the last week or so I haven't had the problem.

DOCTOR X451
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT X451
Now with the gallbladder, it was explained to me that my gallbladder surgery @@@.

DOCTOR X451
That's something we usually try if it helps @@@.

PATIENT X451
But without one if I eat anything greasy @@@.

DOCTOR X451
That's fine.  Maybe it will come out of your stool sometimes but that shouldn't affect whether you know have any @@@.

PATIENT X451
It's embarrassing.  You around guys and you have to stay close @@@ especially in the locker room and I quick run right into the @@@.

DOCTOR X451
@@@.

PATIENT X451
But it's kind of embarrassing often times.

DOCTOR X451
Well try this and @@@ we'll send you to the GI doctors okay @@@.
I'll be right back.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  34:02  DOCTOR IN:  35:15)

DOCTOR X451
Alright sir. So actually this will probably uh we'll see you in six months.

PATIENT X451
Yeah.

DOCTOR X451
Or sooner if you're having @@@.

PATIENT X451
I thought I'd come in three.  You know I always have to come back in three months because one of my prescriptions runs out every 90 days.

DOCTOR X451
Now do you.  There's refills though.  We always give you three refills.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
You know @@@.  If you want @@@.

PATIENT X451
Well what I was wondering, I don't get refills on the happy pills.

DOCTOR X451
Uh.

PATIENT X451
Okay.  I mean I do and they generally send them automatically.

DOCTOR X451
Yeah you have three refills.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
So you get two pills with three refills.

PATIENT X451
Okay.  So after 90 days, after three months then that one's gone by the wayside.

DOCTOR X451
So the happiness just is.  But technically you're only allowed two pills a month.

PATIENT X451
Oh I understand that.  But I'm saying that.

DOCTOR X451
Actually two pills, uh so you need the happy pills, that's the reason you come back every three months.

PATIENT X451
Right, yeah it's in three months.  You know if there was another way but they say you always have to see a doctor before you.

DOCTOR X451
Then @@@.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
And @@@.

PATIENT X451
Alright.

DOCTOR X451
So then um you come back in six months, this is the last time you'll see me cause I'm leaving in June alright.

PATIENT X451
Oh man.  Where you going?

DOCTOR X451
I don't know yet.  I'd like to stay and just do like hospital medicine here.

PATIENT X451
Okay.

DOCTOR X451
Or somewhere else.

PATIENT X451
Maybe you'll still be in the VA System?

DOCTOR X451
Maybe I don't know yet.  I just know I'm interviewing and stuff like that.

PATIENT X451

DOCTOR X451

PATIENT X451

PATIENT X451

DOCTOR X451

PATIENT X451

DOCTOR X451

I've just had that problem lately.

DOCTOR X598
@@@.

PATIENT X598
Really no reason it's a dry hacky cough.

DOCTOR X598
And do you ever choke?

PATIENT X598
No.  I may have actually choked last month during the worst part of it but, that hasn't been a factor lately.

DOCTOR X598
Okay.  How long have you had the cough now?

PATIENT X598
Uh I've had this cough for weeks now.  In fact my first time I came in was early January but I was diagnosed with acid reflux.  I think it was in 2008.

DOCTOR X598
So has it been at least one month with the cough?

PATIENT X598
Uh yes.

DOCTOR X598
Okay.  Are you a smoker?

PATIENT X598
No I've never smoked.

DOCTOR X598
Okay.  @@@ I think we should go ahead and do a chest x-ray.

PATIENT X598
Okay.

DOCTOR X598
Um I mean you're right it's probably your reflux I don't want to miss anything.

PATIENT X598
Uh-huh, right.

DOCTOR X598
Have a seat up here.  Uh any chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X598
No.  Now when the cough is really bad, it's in my chest.

DOCTOR X598
Were you sick before the coughing just started?  I mean did you feel like you got really sick and then you just had the cough that kind of came around or no?

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Hi PATIENT.

PATIENT X598
How you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Good, good, good.  I'm DOCTOR, one of the supervising doctors.

PATIENT X598
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
So you are in pretty good health?

PATIENT X598
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Cool. But you've been coughing.

PATIENT X598
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
And you teach, you're a teacher?

PATIENT X598
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Great.  Um where do you teach?

PATIENT X598
Uh I work as a substitute teacher so uh I go to a lot of different schools.  My area of specialty is social studies.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Gotcha, gotcha.  Um and um do you live with family or by yourself?

PATIENT X598
By myself.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Alright and um how have you been feeling generally?  I mean do you feel like you're in good health, do you feel like you're?

PATIENT X598
I feel that I'm in good health.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X598
But now, for this last month I've been pretty miserable from the cough and it's just uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
And have you had a cold with that?

PATIENT X598
There was a cold with it as well.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X598
Besides, I'm probably all healed from the cold.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Do you have any allergies?

PATIENT X598
None that I know of.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Okay um and um have you ever had a cough like this before?

PATIENT X598
Yes.  I was diagnosed with acid reflux.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X598
In 2008.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X598
And so @@@ things like that, a dry hacky cough before.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Yeah @@@.  

PATIENT X598
I'm not sure, I think probably acid reflux.  Um in early 2005 I had a really bad cough.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X598
Like this.  It could have been from getting the flu shot, I'm not entirely sure.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
@@@ now.

PATIENT X598
No I'm fine.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
So you think it was seasonal, does it happen at certain times of the year?

PATIENT X598
More often in winter than other times.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Does cold air bring it on?

PATIENT X598
It could.  It sure could.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Okay.  Um cause I'm wondering some people get a little bit of asthma with the cold air.

PATIENT X598
And @@@ when I'm exposed to cold air I have a tendency to cough more.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Would it be okay with you if I do a full @@@.  Can you lean forward?

PATIENT X598
Sure.

DOCTOR X598
Good.  Take a breath in, out, again, out hard, out hard, breathe deep, out, one more time out.  Okay keep going in and out, that's good, again.  Alright @@@.  I don't hear a wheeze.  @@@.  What I'm really wondering is would he benefit from, could he be having like a mild cough variant to reactive airway disease which people get in the winter.  I know kids get it all the time.  Um have you ever used an inhaler before?

PATIENT X598
I've tried it yeah before, but it's been a really long time.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X598
Do you want to do the inhaler?

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Yeah, try that and @@@ prn.  Albuterol with a spacer; basically it's just a dilator, bronchodilator.

PATIENT X598
Uh-huh,

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Cause personally I don't think reflux would be the problem to see what kind of cough and you know it didn't sound right.  Um I don't think he's got tuberculosis.  Uh I don't think he's got, because @@@ for allergies.  @@@ but you know you could have this pattern of getting only in the wintertime, I would try him with just an inhaler @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X598
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Because you know you have to have a very significant amount of you know of bronchospasms before you start to wheeze, it's not from your actual cough.

PATIENT X598
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
So we're going to try you on an inhaler.

PATIENT X598
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
And see if that doesn't actually help.

PATIENT X598
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
And then maybe we'll see you back in a couple weeks and see how you're doing.

PATIENT X598
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X598
Good luck.

PATIENT X598

PATIENT X598

FIRST DOCTOR X598

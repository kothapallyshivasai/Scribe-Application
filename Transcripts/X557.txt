PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
And you are smoking?

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
You are smoking?  How much are you smoking a day?

PATIENT X557
Probably a pack.

DOCTOR X557
How long have you been doing that for sir?

PATIENT X557
Hmm a long time.

DOCTOR X557
A long time.  Are you interested in quitting any time soon?

PATIENT X557
It's something I need to do but I don't know.

DOCTOR X557
Not ready yet?

PATIENT X557
@@@.

DOCTOR X557
The reasons why we um like patients to not be smoking is first of all it's you know bad for you.  It can cause cancer, increases your risk for every @@@, @@@ um if you have any kind of cancer in your, you know your family you definitely don't want to be a smoker.  Um the longer you smoke the worse it is for you and you know there are patients that you see on oxygen with COPD, you don't want to be one of them right.  So we recommend that you stop smoking and we have cessation aids and we have a clinic that you can go to too to help you with it, stop smoking but first things first you have to be ready to quit or else it's not gonna work.

PATIENT X557
I know.

DOCTOR X557
And I want you to think hard about it and we'll talk about it next time okay.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
Um if you want assistance we have the gum and the lozenges.  If you want the patch you have to go through the clinic okay.  So let me know if you're interested in any of that okay.

PATIENT X557
You got to go through them in order to.

DOCTOR X557
The Smoking Cessation Clinic.

PATIENT X557
If I did the patch?

DOCTOR X557
Yeah.

PATIENT X557
And the gum and the.

DOCTOR X557
Lozenges you can get here.

PATIENT X557
Now I.

DOCTOR X557
Okay.

PATIENT X557
I'd be willing to give those a shot, give that a shot.

DOCTOR X557
What would you be willing to give a shot?

PATIENT X557
The gum and the.

DOCTOR X557
The gum.

PATIENT X557
Yeah.

DOCTOR X557
Okay you have either gum or the lozenges.  The gum you put it in your mouth, you chew it and you tuck it in the back of your mouth and then every time you get a craving you chew it again.  It's dangerous to chew the gum and smoke and if you need to smoke you just spit it out and then smoke okay.

PATIENT X557
And what about the.

DOCTOR X557
The lozenges same thing, you just suck on the lozenges.

PATIENT X557
You know the lozenges.

DOCTOR X557
You'd rather have the lozenges?  Okay I can give you some but remember no um lozenges and smoking at the same time.

PATIENT X557
@@@.

DOCTOR X557
Sure, sure.

PATIENT X557
I'm thinking about trying to um go without it and see what happens.

DOCTOR X557
Okay.  Alright @@@.  It looks like all of your labs are up-to-date, everything looks good okay.  So let me just @@@ okay.  Do you take all of your medicines, your blood pressure medicines?

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
Cause that's the one thing that's kind of high.  Did you take your medicines today?

PATIENT X557
Yes.

DOCTOR X557
You took the lisinopril?  Half a tablet.

PATIENT X557
Yes.

DOCTOR X557
You did or you didn't?

PATIENT X557
No I took it.

DOCTOR X557
If you didn't we could just keep you on the same medicine but if you did take it we'll have to increase it.

PATIENT X557
I took it.

DOCTOR X557
Okay.

PATIENT X557
I took it this morning.

DOCTOR X557
So I think what you would benefit from is um, are you trying to eat a low salt diet?

PATIENT X557
No.

DOCTOR X557
No okay.  Well you could try to just eat a low salt diet to see if that'll help the blood pressure but we can always increase your medicines just to help it.

PATIENT X557
It may be.

DOCTOR X557
Pretty good.

PATIENT X557
@@@.

DOCTOR X557
Hopefully @@@.

PATIENT X557
Well I been carrying a big bag and I did a lot of walking to get here.

DOCTOR X557
Okay.  If you want let me check it again how's that, before we go ahead and increase your medicine.

PATIENT X557
Okay.  I got refills on?

DOCTOR X557
Well I can make sure before you leave I'll refill everything and I'll mail everything to your home okay.

PATIENT X557
Okay.  I need to get multivitamins.

DOCTOR X557
I can give you some.

PATIENT X557
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X557
Oh you're fine.  What do you normally do for your sinuses?

PATIENT X557
Uh I'm taking this @@@.

DOCTOR X557
I could just give you regular normal saline, sort of a salt spray @@@.  You're right; it must have been from you walking around.  No it's still high.  It was 150/90, a little lower.  

PATIENT X557
@@@ and we might have to increase it @@@.

DOCTOR X557
Does that hurt at all?

PATIENT X557
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X557
Is this okay?

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
Okay.  Alright I will be right back okay.

PATIENT X557
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:08  DOCTOR IN:  54:54)

DOCTOR X557
Alright sir, this is what we're gonna do.  Um we're gonna increase your medicine, the lisinopril to 40 cause your blood pressure is still high on it uh and then the low salt diet.  We're going to check your urine today to make sure @@@ to make sure that it is you're on @@@ from cocaine.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
And then um I'll give you those lozenges.  As far as your pain medicines, so I know you're taking three in the morning and three at nighttime I'll give you the same dose of the morphine.  

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
The thing is there are certain labs that are due for three months now so uh kind of what we want to know is how much are you really taking every day um that way we can prescribe what you need.

PATIENT X557
And I'm in pain, if it ain't too bad then I don't take it but.

DOCTOR X557
Oh I see so when they get bad you take one.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X557
Okay well.  @@@ down here.  So um you take it like the three in the morning and three at night when he has the pain but he doesn't have the pain he doesn't take it at all.

PATIENT X557
No I take them on a regular basis.

DOCTOR X557
Okay.

PATIENT X557
But the other one I take when the pain really bad.

DOCTOR X557
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Sir the reason I asked is because you have um, I'm DOCTOR by the way um.

PATIENT X557
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Back on July 29th you got enough medicine to last you 30 days for three in the morning and three at night.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
But that prescription has lasted you until October now so you're not taking it every day.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Which I'm happy with that you're not taking it.

PATIENT X557
I only take it when I need it.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
That's why I'm @@@ how often you're taking it.

PATIENT X557
No, I'm in a lot of pain right.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
But you don't take the morphine every day right, is that correct?

PATIENT X557
Yes when it only gets bad.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Okay how much do you need it actually is it the long-acting medicine and a short-acting medicine.  How often do you need the short-acting medicine?  You're not taking that at all or?

PATIENT X557
Yeah whenever it's hurting.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
You need to help us out here.  First of all no more cocaine, that's number one for that okay.

PATIENT X557
Okay.  But I thought they brought me back to see the doctor because of the medication.  You know, running out, it was running out and I was just holding on to the last one.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Okay.

PATIENT X557
As long as I could and then you know the last two weeks have been.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
It's really hard and three months was the last time I filled that prescription.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
So if that's how you made 30 days of medicine last for three months.  You must not need medicine that much.

PATIENT X557
It wasn't hurting all that bad and then some pain really, if it ain't really severe.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Okay.

PATIENT X557
I can do.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
How long have @@@ doing that?  I don't want you taking morphine every day if you don't need it.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
What?

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
I don't you to rely on it and you'd be using cocaine and doing cocaine, I don't want you to get addicted to this medication okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X557
Yes ma'am.  I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
We'll go ahead and give you a prescription, the same prescription as the last time and then @@@ okay.

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
And seriously I'm going to check you into the PCP Clinic if you keep having problems with cocaine, you're violating our Narcotic Treatment Program and I can't give you narcotics so please don't use cocaine.  Not only I can't give you the medicine, it's bad for your heart, it causes heart attacks. 

PATIENT X557
Uh-huh.  Well I had told them when I @@@ if possible and um it came back clean.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Okay.

PATIENT X557
It probably got about half and half.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
Okay it's probably not fair to people that are @@@.

PATIENT X557

Doctors talk among themselves.

SECOND DOCTOR X557
And then um you can always call if you're running low on your morphine and let me know okay.

PATIENT X557
Yeah okay.  Yeah it bothers me sometimes, I'm maybe thinking that.

FIRST DOCTOR X557

PATIENT X557

FIRST DOCTOR X557
No you, that's why we want you to use the medicine when you need it, just call and tell her but I guess I'm not even allowed to give you more than one month at a time right.

PATIENT X557

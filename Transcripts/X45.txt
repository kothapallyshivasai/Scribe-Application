PATIENT X45
Okay.  I uh, yeah I got to get back to the gym you know.

DOCTOR X45
Yeah, don't we all.  How are you doing otherwise?

PATIENT X45
Well let me see uh about, okay last month I wrenched my back pretty bad okay.

DOCTOR X45
Okay.  You need to be careful.

PATIENT X45
Yeah I had, it pains like right there but @@@.  I had a pain halfway up the back on this side, on this side okay.

DOCTOR X45
Okay.

PATIENT X45
Uh when I lay on my back or lay down on my side for a while, all of a sudden you know you've got centered.  So I figured well I probably tore a ligament you know and after about three or four weeks it went away.

DOCTOR X45
Good.

PATIENT X45
And it was fine okay.  Then uh, once in a while I get a little blockage in my uh you know right @@@.

DOCTOR X45
Okay.

PATIENT X45
No but uh I usually take stool softeners and after a couple of days you know it cleared up okay.

DOCTOR X45
Yeah.

PATIENT X45
@@@ kidney stone or something you know.

DOCTOR X45
Okay.

PATIENT X45
But uh it cleared up and everything.  Since then everything's been fine okay.

DOCTOR X45

PATIENT X45
Like uh today I spent two hours shoveling snow but you know I don't have any aches or pains.

DOCTOR X45
That's wonderful.

PATIENT X45
Okay.  Uh.

DOCTOR X45
You're not short of breath or anything?

PATIENT X45
Uh I always get short of breath you know, cause I don't exercise so you know.  If I'm shoveling for.

DOCTOR X45
You don't have any pain @@@.

PATIENT X45
Oh no, no, no, no I'd be shoveling for about 20 minutes and then you now I'd have to rest for a while but.

DOCTOR X45
Okay.

PATIENT X45
No pain.  Uh but uh.

DOCTOR X45
Um, @@@ here about the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR X45
Right so I'll order it today, perfect.

PATIENT X45
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X45
So I will order it, they'll schedule it but you need to have labs done.  They require a whole bunch of labs before you get the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X45
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X45
Do you want to do those today or do you want to come back?

PATIENT X45
Well I can come back in a couple of weeks, you know, okay.

DOCTOR X45
The problem is um, okay, couple weeks; can we do it sooner than that?

PATIENT X45
Okay alright.

DOCTOR X45
Alright, next Friday I'll order.

PATIENT X45
Sure, next Friday, okay.  Alright and I'll come back @@@ anything.

DOCTOR X45
They won't do the test right there, they'll schedule it cause you need to take this prep and everything and they usually schedule it for like a month or so okay.  But they won't do the test right away.  They need to look at these labs and there's a bureaucratic way of doing it.

PATIENT X45
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X45
You have to schedule it.  Just because they have a bunch and they need to schedule them.

PATIENT X45
Okay, so next Friday.

DOCTOR X45
You have labs.

PATIENT X45
Oh okay, I'll labs next Friday.

DOCTOR X45
Right and then they'll call you to schedule it.

PATIENT X45
But they uh.

DOCTOR X45
But I put in an order.

PATIENT X45
Right.

DOCTOR X45
And then they'll call you to schedule it.

PATIENT X45
Okay, alright.  Will they just, I mean they do it.  They'll schedule me for the date to do the colonoscopy?

DOCTOR X45
Correct.

PATIENT X45
Okay alright good.

DOCTOR X45
They'll just schedule you to come in and get the information and then uh they'll, at that time give you a date.

PATIENT X45
Alright, okay.

DOCTOR X45
Then you'll come have the test done.

PATIENT X45
Okay the problem I have is my sister usually comes to the house for me but she's in her 70s and she's kind of unreliable.

DOCTOR X45
Okay, so what you can do is maybe request a certain day.  Are certain days better?

PATIENT X45
No, no uh I'm just wondering who's going to drive me here and take me home.

DOCTOR X45
Right someone has to drive you here.

PATIENT X45
So.

DOCTOR X45
But you'll know like a couple weeks in advance but.

PATIENT X45
Okay, well that's what I'm asking, is he gonna get a nurse to do it?

DOCTOR X45
Drive you here?

PATIENT X45
Yeah, to pick me up and take me home or not?

DOCTOR X45
No I don't think someone will do that.  How close, how far away do you live?

PATIENT X45
In Thistle.

DOCTOR X45
Can you take a bus?

PATIENT X45
Uh, well I would drive here, the question is can I get home.

DOCTOR X45
You can't drive home after the anesthesia; they just don't want you to.

PATIENT X45
Okay.

DOCTOR X45
You're not gonna be like snoring and sleeping but you might be a just a little drowsy.  That's why they prefer you take like @@@.

PATIENT X45
Ah I see.

DOCTOR X45
@@@.

PATIENT X45
Alright then.  Oh so there's no uh service at the hospital that would drive me home?

DOCTOR X45
Uh no there isn't.  I don't think there is.  I'm not entirely sure.

PATIENT X45
Oh.

DOCTOR X45
You could ask the travel people about that.

PATIENT X45
Okay, I'll talk to my landlady.  Well she brings her son here okay; I'll ask her if she'll do it for me.

DOCTOR X45
Okay.

PATIENT X45
Okay, good enough.  So I'll here Friday, then Friday they'll give me a day for uh.

DOCTOR X45
Correct.  I'll put the order in with the labs and then once you get those labs then they will uh they'll take care of it.  Okay.

PATIENT X45
Okay good.  Alright, that sounds good.

DOCTOR X45

DOCTOR X45
We'll find out next week.

PATIENT X45
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X45
With the lab tests.

PATIENT X45
Alright.

DOCTOR X45
The problem with the kidneys is you really don't know if they're really bad until they're really bad usually what happens is that when you feel it.

PATIENT X45
Alright, okay.

DOCTOR X45
Um your kidneys, like I said they're working 50% to 60% of what they should.  The best way to prevent them from getting worse is keep controlling the blood pressure which is why I'm @@@ your blood pressure.

PATIENT X45
@@@.

DOCTOR X45
Okay.

PATIENT X45
@@@.

DOCTOR X45
You know even though I got a lower value here and that cuff was a little bigger you know, if you check it at home daily and it's running 140 to 150, that leads me to want to treat it more aggressively.

PATIENT X45
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR X45
You know so all the data shows that if you keep your sugar other things will, but more so the blood pressure in diabetics, you can perhaps slow down the progression of the kidney disease.  You can't stop it per say but you can really slow it down okay.

PATIENT X45
Well.

DOCTOR X45
And I do know control like @@@ at 2, 2.2, 2.5 which is about 30%, 35% of normal kidney function um for years.

PATIENT X45
Alright and I'm @@@.

DOCTOR X45
Your numbers not important.

PATIENT X45
Alright yeah.

DOCTOR X45
You're at 1.8.

PATIENT X45
Okay alright.

DOCTOR X45
Alright so don't worry about the number you, don't worry about the numbers, they come to me.

PATIENT X45
Okay.

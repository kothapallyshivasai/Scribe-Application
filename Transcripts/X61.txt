DOCTOR X61
PATIENT?

PATIENT X61
Yeah.

DOCTOR X61
I did.  I looked at most of this already and @@@.

PATIENT X61
Okay I was just making they sent it to you.

DOCTOR X61
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
No I got it, thank you for doing that.  Um how you doing?

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
I saw you last in December since I saw you you followed up with the cardiologist.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
Um and that they're @@@.

PATIENT X61
Yeah that @@@.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh, yeah. Did you see DOCTOR?  @@@.

PATIENT X61
Yeah I seen um.

DOCTOR X61
DOCTOR?

PATIENT X61
Yes DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X61
@@@?

PATIENT X61
Right.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.  He's going to start me on.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@ and then.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
And he wanted to take me off the Coumadin.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh and have you stopped the Coumadin?

PATIENT X61
No I've been still taking it.

DOCTOR X61
He wanted you to stop it though.  @@@.

PATIENT X61
No they the ones that @@@ told me to come in.

DOCTOR X61
So you have you started the amlodipine @@@?

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@ cause your blood pressure is really high today so, I just wanted to see if you've been taking that at all so we definitely need to get you take that medicine.

PATIENT X61
So I'll have like three blood pressure pills?

DOCTOR X61
Yeah so you have the amlodipine, the metoprolol and the lisinopril.  Lisinopril will also protect your kidneys.  It helps your blood pressure but also your kidneys because of your diabetes.  That one kind of works in two ways okay.  Um you know we can kind of cut back on that you know, like I said you can always, you know @@@ losing weight will bring your blood pressure down, watching your salt intake @@@ under control so these aren't @@@ medicines you know if everything gets improve you can always get off of those okay.

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
But right now your blood pressure is too high, we need to control that.  High blood pressure is going to cause a heart attack, a stroke and we don't want that, you really don't @@@ bad from happening.

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
Did you ever have that tooth surgery?

PATIENT X61
Yeah I did.

DOCTOR X61
Did you stop the penicillin or are you gonna keep going on it.

PATIENT X61
No I stopped it for uh um, I stopped it two days @@@.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
And then one day @@@ and then I just started @@@.  I've been taking two.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.

PATIENT X61
Two pills a day.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.  So looking through their notes, I don't know if they're going to @@@ while you're on the Coumadin okay.

PATIENT X61
Hmm.

DOCTOR X61
And the only reason @@@.  There is questionable thrombus in your ventricle @@@ heart.  And you @@@ ultrasound of the heart here and we didn't see anything there okay.  It could have been that the clot already dissolved.  @@@ body resolved the clot okay.  Um so I agree with DOCTOR, I think its okay to stop the Coumadin okay.  There's no reason right now that you're on it that we can find um.  It's either because people have clots in their legs or their lungs um or there gonna need it for their heart but for you I think it'll be safe to stop it.

PATIENT X61
Alright.  The only reason they put me on it is because I.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
Yeah right after the heart surgery.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT X61
Probably about nine or ten months later.

DOCTOR X61
Yeah.

PATIENT X61
@@@.  They put a stent in one.

DOCTOR X61
Yeah.

PATIENT X61
They said the other one was too small to put a stent in and that's when they put me on the Coumadin to kind of @@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@ so @@@ but I don't agree with the way they do that and neither does DOCTOR so um normally they have @@@ stent @@@ and some medicine in your arm.  There are some medicines recommended.

PATIENT X61
Right.

DOCTOR X61
Along with the aspirin.

PATIENT X61
Right.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
So if you feel safer, they can @@@ with the Plavix um but I would definitely recommend stopping the Coumadin.

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.

PATIENT X61
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X61
That's if you feel safer for that.  I don't think you need it but if it's gonna make you feel better its okay.  The Plavix and the aspirin alone are going to cause enough blood thinning that it shouldn't be a problem.  But taking all three of those, @@@ so I would recommend aspirin and the Plavix.

PATIENT X61
Yeah I take Plavix, @@@ took me off it.

DOCTOR X61
Did DOCTOR @@@?

PATIENT X61
No he said there really wasn't a really good @@@.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.

PATIENT X61
But @@@.  

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.  So I can have, I assume @@@ consider in my notes so I'm going to put my notes with DOCTOR and I'll discuss with you what we can do and when we can do it okay.  Have you been having any chest pain or trouble breathing?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
No.

PATIENT X61
Well, @@@.

DOCTOR X61
I know @@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
I do have uh shortness of breath.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
And then if I rest a couple of minutes or so.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
You know it's normal again.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.  So you had some blood tests recently.

PATIENT X61
Yeah I went to the Lab.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.  Uh @@@ kidney function.  It was just @@@ higher than normal and we're going to do an angiogram and @@@ from that @@@ kidney function is good.  So @@@ do it today or the next time you come we can do the blood work-up but the cardiologists are want us to check your kidney function again okay before anything happens.  Um have you been checking your sugars at home?

PATIENT X61
Yes.

DOCTOR X61
And how have they been running?

PATIENT X61
Uh pretty normal, generally in the 120s.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
Yeah @@@.  Blood pressure is fine.  There's something else.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
No @@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
Right.  So I'm down @@@ diabetes metformin and uh.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
The glipizide.

DOCTOR X61
The glipizide uh-huh.  And you have the blood pressure @@@?

PATIENT X61
Yes.

DOCTOR X61
How's that doing?

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
It's doing okay?  Okay.  And how's your back pain doing?

PATIENT X61
Uh well I take a couple of pain pills at the end of the day.  But it doesn't hurt right now.

DOCTOR X61
Good, good and what have you been doing @@@?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
No.  Are you doing any activity or?  Like walking or any kind of exercise?

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X61
You need to increase your activity okay.  Like I said weight loss and exercise can help with your blood pressure and your diabetes okay and it's good for your heart.  I'm not saying go run marathons and no, @@@ but you can do a half hour walk a day, you know, it's not much.  I know it's cold outside, it's hard to go outside but go to a mall or someplace indoors or @@@ you know.  I think that's gonna be the best medicine for you is to get yourself a little bit more activity every day okay.  Um it's gonna help with everything. It's going to make you do better and eventually you might be a little tired @@@ but if you do it in time you're gonna get better and better and I think in the end you could get off of some blood pressure medicines.  You could get off some of your diabetes medicines.  You know we can get you back in a healthy state @@@.  

PATIENT X61
Yeah.

DOCTOR X61
So this is something that you have to work on okay, no one's going to help you do that.

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
Any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
@@@?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
Trouble urinating or having bowel movements?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
No, okay.  Anything else that's been bothering you or specific questions that you have?

PATIENT X61
Not really.

DOCTOR X61
So you're gonna get the Plavix and you're gonna start that.  You're gonna stop the Coumadin, that's okay with you.  I believe its okay @@@.  Um and you can continue that blood pressure medicine @@@.  Do you have a blood pressure machine at home?

PATIENT X61
Yes.

DOCTOR X61
Have you been checking your blood pressure at all?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
No okay.  I want you to try getting it a couple times a week and maybe put it on a piece of paper and keeping track of it.  You better call us so we can see what your blood pressures are at home and we'll what they are in the clinic and if they're a little higher than they normally are and I see at home that your blood pressure is a more normal level again, I can take you off some of your pills okay.  @@@ one in the morning and one at night and @@@ at lunch then @@@, you know once in a while @@@.  We really look at one number and we focus on that one number and it might be @@@.

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.  @@@ lisinopril?  @@@ today?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.  So I don't know.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.  Say ah.

PATIENT X61
Ah. 

DOCTOR X61
What happened here, @@@.

PATIENT X61
Yeah.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.  @@@.  Is that going to be okay?

PATIENT X61
Yeah that's fine.

DOCTOR X61
You smoking?

PATIENT X61
What?

DOCTOR X61
Are you smoking?

PATIENT X61
Uh sometimes I do.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.  It's really bad for your lungs.  @@@ okay.

PATIENT X61
They say.

DOCTOR X61
No alcohol?

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
I know.  @@@.  You know it's bad.

PATIENT X61
@@@.  Cigar.

DOCTOR X61
How about alcohol?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
When was the last time you felt some chest pain?

PATIENT X61
I haven't felt pain since my surgery.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
Oh, I get it if I walk too far or something like that or I run too far.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
Good.  Now deep breath for me in and out.  Any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X61
No.

DOCTOR X61
Take a look at your feet.  @@@.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@.  So let's have a plan that we need to do right.  I'll be talking with DOCTOR and see if we can get this angio set up for you.  I don't think it's urgent but I think it'd be beneficial for you.  I know you've had a couple in the last year.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
@@@ so um, but it's just because we don't want you know having another.

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
I know but it's better than  having a heart attack and dying to right?

PATIENT X61
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X61
Um @@@ good.  So the one @@@ and like I said the best thing we can do is.

PATIENT X61
@@@?

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.  @@@ you don't remember or feel anything.

PATIENT X61
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X61
No you're not completely out but you have anesthesia and on a breathing machine but you're pretty out of it.

PATIENT X61
I know @@@.

DOCTOR X61
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X61
@@@ but on the last two they didn't.  @@@.  That's why I asked you that.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.  @@@ talk to my attending @@@.  If he does want it right now we might have it @@@.  

PATIENT X61
@@@.

DOCTOR X61
They only checked your Coumadin level, that's all they checked so.  Give me one second I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X61
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT: 22:26  DOCTOR IN:  28:37)

DOCTOR X61
Okay so @@@ do the blood work right now @@@.  Um one thing he wanted me to talk to you about is um your sugars have been very well controlled and he really thinks that we could get away with just one of those diabetes medicines rather than two so I wanted to talk to you about if you were willing to try how you feel about having just one of those medicines?  @@@ the pills that you're taking.

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
Your sugar was pretty well controlled and your last A1c that we look at, that averages the sugar, it's pretty low and there are some studies saying that @@@ you don't want to drop them too low on the sugars so um.  What I would recommend is you're on the metformin and the glipizide.  We could stop the glipizide and increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day you're taking 500 twice a day right now and that would be enough to control your blood sugars.  Would that be okay with you?

PATIENT X61
Yeah.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.  So I'm going to delete @@@ for you.  We're going to stop this medicine and we're going to increase this medicine and then @@@.  We get the average, we can check it and see how it is and if we have to @@@ at that time.  Hopefully you won't have to.

PATIENT X61
Okay.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.  Um so no blood work, @@@ like DOCTOR said, I'll send my note to him and @@@.  In the meantime increase your activity, try to cut back on the smoking and all that okay.  Does that make sense?  Is that okay with you?

PATIENT X61
Yeah.

DOCTOR X61
Any questions or concerns about that?

PATIENT X61
Uh no, no.

DOCTOR X61
No.

PATIENT X61
You're fine.

DOCTOR X61
Okay.  Stay warm this winter okay.  I'm gonna see you in four months @@@ but @@@.  Is that okay?

PATIENT X61
That's fine.

DOCTOR X61
Check that blood pressure once in a while and @@@.  Okay.  You got it?

PATIENT X61
Yeah.

DOCTOR X61
Okay you're gonna take a left and a right.

PATIENT X61
Thank you.

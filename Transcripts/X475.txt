DOCTOR X475
PATIENT?  

PATIENT X475
How you doing?

DOCTOR X475
How you doing, my name is DOCTOR.  Have we met before?

PATIENT X475
I believe so.

DOCTOR X475
We have, I didn't have a chance to look through all the chart before I saw you so um, you're on here for some reason for this week and for next week.

PATIENT X475
Huh?

DOCTOR X475
You have an appointment with me this week and next week.

PATIENT X475
I do.

DOCTOR X475
For some reason, I don't know.  You might want to cancel the next week one since it's in the computer.  Uh.

PATIENT X475
That was for my cholesterol.

DOCTOR X475
Maybe it was in the computer.  You saw DOCTOR last time.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
But that was more like your three so um I'll just kind of talk to you about @@@.  How are you doing today?

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
Any concerns, problems, grievances?

PATIENT X475
No I don't have any today.

DOCTOR X475
Huh?

PATIENT X475
None today.

DOCTOR X475
Okay and you also saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT X475
The appointment next week might be for cholesterol.

DOCTOR X475
Maybe this was with me and I don't know if I can see you twice in a row.

PATIENT X475
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X475
But you might just see the pharmacist or something but.

PATIENT X475
Yeah I think that's who it is.

DOCTOR X475
Yeah but for some reason it was made with me so when you leave here, just check with the front desk so you don't have an appointment for the doctor but with somebody else.  Uh.

PATIENT X475
Cause the last time I was here I saw the pharmacist.

DOCTOR X475
Yeah.  I'll take a look.  Your blood pressure's good.  So it looks like you have high blood pressure which is good and you are currently uh.

PATIENT X475
No.

DOCTOR X475
Blood pressure right?

PATIENT X475
The um, the um pravastatin you gave me.

DOCTOR X475
Yes.

PATIENT X475
The last time, they're five times bigger than the ones I usually take.

DOCTOR X475
Really?

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
Like @@@ bigger?

PATIENT X475
Right.

DOCTOR X475
Are they hard for you to swallow?

PATIENT X475
Yes.

DOCTOR X475
Yeah.

PATIENT X475
The ones I had before were smaller round pieces.

DOCTOR X475
And the problem, I think that you're on pravastatin, I don't know let me see um.

PATIENT X475
She @@@ the last time I was here.

DOCTOR X475
Did they tell you why they switched you from @@@?

PATIENT X475
They wanted a higher dosage.

DOCTOR X475
Yeah that's okay.  The pravastatin is stronger than simvastatin.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
So it's not that you not had the medicine before, it's just that you have trouble @@@ normal medicine it's just a different medicine.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
And so it's a different manufacturer that made your medicine. 

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
They're going to be potentially bigger or smaller or a different shape or something like that.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
Is there a way to break it in half and take it half at a time?

PATIENT X475
I will if I can.

DOCTOR X475
And just try to do that and you look like you're already on a full dose of it right?

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
You had a set of labs in January, I don't know if DOCTOR went over the results with you.

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
Uh for your cholesterol and I was just kind of wondering, were you fasting that day?  Do you remember?

PATIENT X475
I think so.

DOCTOR X475
You think you were, cause it was still kind of high.  Your uh LDL was 166.

PATIENT X475
Yeah she said it was going down some from the last time.

DOCTOR X475
It did go down some, that's correct, it did go down.

PATIENT X475
That's why I started taking the cholesterol tabs.

DOCTOR X475
Now you actually take them now?

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
Um in January were you taking them?

PATIENT X475
Yes.

DOCTOR X475
Every day, not skipping any evenings always.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.  Well it's still kind of high um.

PATIENT X475
But now I tell you with these white ones.

DOCTOR X475
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X475
I haven't been taking them.  I've been taking my olds ones.

DOCTOR X475
I see okay.  So you.

PATIENT X475
Since I got those but I just got those like two weeks ago.

DOCTOR X475
Okay so.

PATIENT X475
So I was finishing up my small pills.

DOCTOR X475
I see, so when you took your last cholesterol test in January which ones were you taking?

PATIENT X475
The small ones.

DOCTOR X475
The small ones.

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
All this time you were taking the ones @@@ doses.

PATIENT X475
Right.

DOCTOR X475
You weren't taking the new ones?

PATIENT X475
No.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.

PATIENT X475
They just came about two weeks ago.

DOCTOR X475
So you just got the new ones.

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
And have you been taking them?

PATIENT X475
No.

DOCTOR X475
Cause they're too big.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.

PATIENT X475
I been taking the smaller ones.

DOCTOR X475
Alright, okay.  So let's try to do this, try to take the big ones and break them in half and take them half at a time and then once you're on those for about two months we'll recheck the cholesterol and see if you do better on those.

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
So that and then blood pressures are good.  Do you take an aspirin a day?

PATIENT X475
Yes.

DOCTOR X475
And then, alright.  Any more problem with stomach problems?

PATIENT X475
No.

DOCTOR X475
Do you have burning?

PATIENT X475
No since I take them every day.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.  Um smoking?

PATIENT X475

DOCTOR X475
Uh any decreasing of how much you're smoking yet?

PATIENT X475

PATIENT X475

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
Alright.  Yeah and your good cholesterol is actually pretty darn good and you're bad cholesterol, your triglyceride cholesterol were all @@@ you just have a very isolated cholesterol to try to treat.

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
I'll be back within a couple of minutes.

(DOCTOR OUT:  17:02  DOCTOR IN:  30:27)
DOCTOR X475
Alright sir.  I had nice long conversation about your cholesterol pills and he got a little confused but we got him straightened out.  So you are taking now the simvastatin, the old little pill.

PATIENT X475
Old pink pill.

DOCTOR X475
Whatever, old pink pill.

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
And how much of it, what's the dose of that one?

PATIENT X475
Um I think 20.

DOCTOR X475
20, only 20?

PATIENT X475
I think, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.

PATIENT X475
But I'm taking a whole one.

DOCTOR X475
A whole one.  Okay, so here's the thing.  There's the cholesterol pill that you're taking, there's like a whole bunch of different ones.  They're all almost the same.

PATIENT X475
Hmm.

DOCTOR X475
@@@ so we just have @@@ to try to figure this out.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
This new big one that you got sent is actually not as strong as the old little pink one.

PATIENT X475
Well that's 80.

DOCTOR X475
The dose itself actually they don't correlate with numbers.

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
@@@ strong the actual medicine but they are similar but the dosing wasn't quite @@@.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
So did you have diarrhea with the little pink pill?

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
How much diarrhea, how bad was it?

PATIENT X475
Um just one, after I take it and a little while after I have to go to the washroom.

DOCTOR X475
Just the one time.

PATIENT X475
Yeah.

DOCTOR X475
Okay so that's not real diarrhea.

PATIENT X475
No it was, I think it was cause you know I, how @@@ it.

DOCTOR X475
Yeah okay.  Are you willing to try it again I mean you've been taking it now.

PATIENT X475
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X475
Without trouble.

PATIENT X475
Right.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.  So what we're gonna do is that we'll @@@ also a dose of 80.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
Which @@@.  So we'll try to do that.  We'll put you on a full dose of the old pink pill okay.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
And have you take that because it's stronger and it's smaller.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh, right.

DOCTOR X475
So it won't be, but try to take it okay.

PATIENT X475
Alright.

DOCTOR X475
So we'll stop the pravastatin, the big horse pills.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
Uh and then I'm gonna give you the full dose of the other ones okay.

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
And we'll see how your cholesterol does on that.

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
Now and if you are on that pill full dose and you're taking it and you take it for at least a year.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
And we still can't get your cholesterol under control; we actually do have another one that's stronger okay.

PATIENT X475
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X475
So we'll talk about that after the other one first okay.

PATIENT X475
Okay.

DOCTOR X475
Okay.  Alright, does that make sense?

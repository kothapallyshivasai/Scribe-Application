DOCTOR X588
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X588
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X588
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X588
Yeah okay yeah.  Once I'm up there I would like to know what did the doc from upstairs, which I really did not like the doctor from the Pain Clinic.

DOCTOR X588
Oh you didn't?  What's the name?

PATIENT X588
That's what I'd like to know because every time I go up there there's like 10,000 different doctors I keep seeing.

DOCTOR X588
You need to see okay.  So the one you saw in December?

PATIENT X588
The one that I seen in December yes.  I tried to explain to him.

DOCTOR X588
Okay the Pain Fellow NAME?

PATIENT X588
Yes.  I tried to explain to him that the procedure that they did the month before.

DOCTOR X588
Oh.

PATIENT X588
Instead of doing good like all the other ones, it actually was worse.  I said the procedure must, you know if they don't work they must have been done wrong.  He said no none of the procedures have been done wrong.  If it's gonna work it's not done wrong.  My logically it was done wrong.  Um well first of all I never feel the injections coming in and this one hurted like.

DOCTOR X588
Oh really.

PATIENT X588
A lot.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
I mean yeah it was right where my pain was and what it did was make the pain even more worse.

DOCTOR X588
Really?

PATIENT X588
Yeah because by the time I got home.

DOCTOR X588
Hmm.

PATIENT X588
And moving around.  I'm not the type of person that I'm gonna sit down, it's just gonna make the pains more worse anyway.

DOCTOR X588
Hmm.

PATIENT X588
So.

DOCTOR X588
Okay give me one minute and I'm just gonna look at your chart here.

PATIENT X588
Sure.

DOCTOR X588
Since I haven't seen you before.  @@@.  Blood pressure everything looks fine.  @@@ what they wanted to do the last time is, it looks like they saw you in the actual General Medicine Clinic last July, looks like they there were some issues in your lumbar spine.  Okay.  Did you ever see Neurosurgery about this back problem?

PATIENT X588
Uh yes I did.

DOCTOR X588
And when did you see them?

PATIENT X588
Well I don't want to put them, you know they got a, but the only operation that I told them that I would let them do.

DOCTOR X588
Oh yeah okay.

PATIENT X588
Yeah, just letting you know.

DOCTOR X588
Uh-huh is the left lower.

PATIENT X588
It's a neuro type of operation.

DOCTOR X588
That's fines, yeah it's here.

PATIENT X588
Because I will not do it.

DOCTOR X588
@@@.

PATIENT X588
Yeah.

DOCTOR X588
Okay so then.

PATIENT X588
But the other one that I would like to get operated is the @@@ because I don't know if that may be one of those chipped bones, the ones that are on the right side.

DOCTOR X588
What chipped?

PATIENT X588
I have two chipped bones on each side and are real pointy because I don't understand why the pain goes from the, from here from my back and it just constantly here, both constantly completely around my leg.

DOCTOR X588
Around your leg?

PATIENT X588
It doesn't, no, no, it doesn't go down my leg.  Not as much as it just stays around my pelvis and my hip together.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.  When you getting the previous pain shots they were working but this time it didn't work.

PATIENT X588
And this time it just made it worse.  So that's why I'm.

DOCTOR X588
@@@.

PATIENT X588
I had a, you know I had um @@@ ended up worse because first of all he was kind of telling me to try to give me some pill to put me to sleep.  That's supposed to leave you like a.

DOCTOR X588
Oh was it a muscle relaxer?

PATIENT X588
No, no, it's used for depression.  I told him no.  And it's no, for one there's no sleeping pills that work, supposed to make me sleep unless it's like a horse tranquilizer to knock me out but sleeping pills don't seem to work on me.  I don't, they'll knock me out for about the most, the maximum is maybe four hours and that's maximum.

DOCTOR X588
Uh-huh.  Well.

PATIENT X588
And I can take a really high dose, it still will not work.

DOCTOR X588
Got it.  So they gave you gabapentin.

PATIENT X588
No.

DOCTOR X588
You're not getting that anywhere?

PATIENT X588
No I stopped taking the gabapentin.  I told them that since four months ago.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
It was the beginning of summer because they were, the ones that I had I had to gradually put them down because I couldn't stop taking them because they were giving me an epileptic attack so I gradually had to stop, that's what the doctor told me.  So I gradually stopped you know, started taking less and less and less until finally because I stopped for the simple reason.

DOCTOR X588
Do you have a history of epilepsy?

PATIENT X588
No but they say if I stop taking the gabapentin.

DOCTOR X588
Oh any pills.

PATIENT X588
The doses that I was at that that could happen.

DOCTOR X588
@@@.

PATIENT X588
But.

DOCTOR X588
Do you, are you getting trazodone right now?

PATIENT X588
I take the Vicodins and the Vicodins I take, I take one to two depending on the pain.

DOCTOR X588
How many times a day?

PATIENT X588
A day I take it maybe three times a day.

DOCTOR X588
Okay, what about.

PATIENT X588
Two to three times depending.  Now the.

DOCTOR X588
What about the morphine?

PATIENT X588
The morphines I was taking them as scheduled but I noticed that um.

DOCTOR X588
So you're taking it?

PATIENT X588
When I don't take them.

DOCTOR X588
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X588
I get a tremendous knee, like joint pains, pains in my joints.  I get uh I guess that's the side effect of it but I get tremendous joint pain.

DOCTOR X588
Okay so are you taking it now or not?

PATIENT X588
Yes I've been taking one to two a day only.

DOCTOR X588
One to two a day.

PATIENT X588
I'm taking; I do take more of the Vicodins than I do take.

DOCTOR X588
Do you take the morphine 15 mg?

PATIENT X588
The 15 mg.

DOCTOR X588
When was the last time you got if filled?  Are you still taking, do you still have some?

PATIENT X588
I had some left, I just finished running out of them because last month they were gonna give them to me and I said no I just want to talk to them because I really didn't want to talk to that guy.  He really wasn't.

DOCTOR X588
The Pain Clinic was giving you Vicodin?

PATIENT X588
The Pain, yeah they said that they were going to transfer everything down to me through the doctor but I just simply didn't want to talk to the guy.  The guy was in, you know with this thing that he wants to take me to um that I need to see a psychiatrist.  Why do I need to see a psychiatrist?  Oh it's part of the pain management.  Okay its part of the pain management and I can understand that but I don't want to see a psychiatrist.  Well you have no choice.  What do you mean I don't have no choice?

DOCTOR X588
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X588
No come on now, you trying to take me to go see a psychiatrist I have a physical problem not a mental problem.

DOCTOR X588
I understand.

PATIENT X588
Okay now I tried to explain that to him.  I says yes I do get stressed out.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
I was stressed out at the time.  It took, it took the people here, it took them for about an hour and a half just to give me a really mild dose of something that was supposed to be an anti-depressant because I kept telling them I am not depressed.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
I am stressed out.

DOCTOR X588
Got it.

PATIENT X588
Stressed.  I was living in a garage.

DOCTOR X588
Do you live alone?

PATIENT X588
Yes, I have my own place.  You see my blood pressure went down.  My blood pressure was high because @@@ I'm frustrated.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
You know I'm not depressed because if I would've been depressed I would have been looking like I lived in a garage.  I maintained myself.  I was maintaining myself you know.

DOCTOR X588
Right.

PATIENT X588
Mentally, physically.

DOCTOR X588
Right.

PATIENT X588
You know.

DOCTOR X588
Let me just look at this.  So basically you were taking Vicodin instead of the morphine?

PATIENT X588
Yes.

DOCTOR X588
Got it.

PATIENT X588
And then I ran out so I had no choice but to take, what did the urine come out?

DOCTOR X588
So you ran out of Vicodin?

PATIENT X588
When I ran out of the Vicodin.

DOCTOR X588
The Vicodin.

PATIENT X588
Because I usually have.

DOCTOR X588
So do you want to go back on Vicodin?

PATIENT X588
I want to go back to the Vicodin.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
There's still a little bit of the morphine.  Half of the morphine as a matter of fact, the pills of the morphine.  Because I only take them like once in a while.  If I really start feeling a lot of pain and I see that the Vicodin is not helping because I can only take a certain amount a day and I don't like to have it like two, three days taking that big amount of it so I try to take a morphine to kind of you know the Vicodins because the Vicodin can handle it.  I don't want my liver @@@.  I drink a lot of water you know so.  And I drink mineral water which is good and I drink a lot of tea.

DOCTOR X588
Oh okay.

PATIENT X588
Tea is very good.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah I know that because you stopped the gabapentin but the medication that he also gave you amitriptyline actually we do prescribe it for people with back pain and nerve pain, the physical nerve pain you know.  The medicines have different reasons for them and not everything has to be.

PATIENT X588
That's the one, the anti-depression one that he supposedly.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah it's classified, technically for marketing purposes it is classified as neuropathic pain but um we do use that for neuropathic pain. If you don't want to use the gabapentin.

PATIENT X588
Then I take it for that.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah you could use that actually.

PATIENT X588
So he said one pill to go to sleep though, that's what he told me.

DOCTOR X588
Um I want to check a name with you instead.  Maybe it'll work.  I'll @@@.

PATIENT X588
Okay.

DOCTOR X588
Let me just see if I can.  Oh I see.  Um did he offer a second injection?  I guess you didn't want it from him right?

PATIENT X588
No.

DOCTOR X588
Do you want it with someone else?  So do you want to go back to the clinic, do you want to see someone else?  Is that what it is?

PATIENT X588
I wanted the guy that did it before not him.

DOCTOR X588
Okay but you were okay with someone else?

PATIENT X588
Yeah, yes, yes.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
Right.

DOCTOR X588
Not that guy.

PATIENT X588
No I just want the.

DOCTOR X588
Okay um.

PATIENT X588
Yeah because sometimes I go there and it's like you notice in the records it's never the same guy.

DOCTOR X588
So they did try but I'll put another consult in and see and you would like to have it be to repeat injection and I'll make sure you know you can specify it or when they call to make the appointment you can always.  The name of the person was DOCTOR.

PATIENT X588
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X588
Okay, if it's possible just be like oh no DOCTOR just be like I would like it with another Pain Clinic doctor other than DOCTOR.

PATIENT X588
The best person they had up there was DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X588
So just request DOCTOR, how do you spell it?

PATIENT X588
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X588
I'll put it in.

PATIENT X588
DOCTOR but he's moved, he's gone.

DOCTOR X588
So who else is there?

PATIENT X588
Uh the ones from before him, the German guy, is he German?

DOCTOR X588
I don't know, I don't know people.

PATIENT X588
I don't either.

DOCTOR X588
How about DOCTOR?

PATIENT X588
Yeah.

DOCTOR X588
Is he good?

PATIENT X588
Uh the one from, not December, the one from three months ago.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
That's him.  The last injection I think I had was either in September or October.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
Whoever that doctor was.

DOCTOR X588
DOCTOR?

PATIENT X588
There you go.

DOCTOR X588
You want him?

PATIENT X588
Yeah.

DOCTOR X588
Okay then I'll refer to him.

PATIENT X588
Okay.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.  Sometimes you can go see online what they have over there you know I mean.

PATIENT X588
It varies.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
Never the same person right.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah we're fine.  Alright.  So you need refills of everything.

PATIENT X588
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
And if you can give me more of Vicodin.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
Okay.

DOCTOR X588
Um for you, it's sort of like well I'll meet the patient and I'm like oh maybe Vicodin will need to be filled but you're really taking the steps to improve the pain.  You definitely have very severe lumbar back pain.

PATIENT X588
Right I did.

DOCTOR X588
And you need the medicines so.

PATIENT X588
Right.

DOCTOR X588
That's fine okay.

PATIENT X588
That's just.

DOCTOR X588
That's fine.

PATIENT X588
But I'm also a very skeptic type of person.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.

PATIENT X588
On medicine, I'm not a medicine person.

DOCTOR X588
No I think yeah.

PATIENT X588
That's why I'd rather have the you know the discussion with the doctor and let them know what I feel, how I feel about the medicine because if I don't then it'd just be like something that I just be like oh no that's not really doing me good.  It's just like okay like if you're, I don't like a certain beer cause it does me wrong and all of a sudden that's all they drink now am I gonna drink the same beer just to be hanging out with them.  You understand?

DOCTOR X588
Right.

PATIENT X588
Even though it's tearing me apart.

DOCTOR X588
Did you go have physical therapy?

PATIENT X588
Uh physical no, but not to say that she told me to reschedule me and then also I would like to know if I can get rescheduled through cause I was supposed to have done my MRIs redone because it's been three years ago.

DOCTOR X588
Oh.

PATIENT X588
Because I missed my appointment.

DOCTOR X588
The last MRI of the lumbar spine was last year in February so it hasn't been two years, it's been one year.

PATIENT X588
The MRI?

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.  Of the lumbar spine?

PATIENT X588
Oh because I came on an emergency I think it was.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
On the 24th, somewhere around there.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah.

PATIENT X588
That's right I forgot I had came in on emergency.

DOCTOR X588
So I don't think you need another one.

PATIENT X588
No okay.

DOCTOR X588
You were seen in @@@.  And the cervical one do you still have a lot of neck pain?

PATIENT X588
The neck pain, it's even here, it's always there but the pressures not there.

DOCTOR X588
Got it.  So that's fine you don't have to get another one.

PATIENT X588
Yeah that's the main, the main thing is now I don't feel like I'm carrying a big elephant in my back and my neck I can deal with the crackling cause I do do the exercises every day.

DOCTOR X588
Oh.

PATIENT X588
Alright.

DOCTOR X588
Very good.

PATIENT X588
And I don't carry anything in my hands; I can't carry nothing in my hands.

DOCTOR X588
Oh.

PATIENT X588
I carry it in my shoulder cause if I carry it in my hands it hurts my shoulders.

DOCTOR X588
Oh.

PATIENT X588
And if I carry it on my shoulders it doesn't hurt my shoulders but if I carry it in my hands it hurts my shoulders.  Totally backwards.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.  I'm gonna listen to you okay.

PATIENT X588
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X588
No other problems, you been doing okay?

PATIENT X588

DOCTOR X588
Oh I won't @@@ okay.

PATIENT X588
For some reason why is I can't sit like, like.

DOCTOR X588
Stand up for me.

PATIENT X588
Like some people like sit back and put, like okay, like okay if I sit like this where I have pressure on my back I can't do that for too long but for some reason it's like, like I'm building up the whole pressure it's like all the way up here.

DOCTOR X588
Oh really.

PATIENT X588
Yeah so I can't lay in the bed now, like the guys laying there the bed like put the pillow there because by some reason the pressure.  I don't know if it's the nerves.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah because it's like when you put your head back it further closing the disk space so that there's already a narrowing there sustained.

PATIENT X588
Oh that's what caused that.

DOCTOR X588
You're narrowing it a little bit more and that's how you've got pressure.

PATIENT X588
Woo cause boy does it and it hurts really bad.

DOCTOR X588
That's why, yeah.

PATIENT X588
If feel like I have a really bad headache.

DOCTOR X588
That's why and you can't really bend down?  You don't have to bend down @@@.

PATIENT X588
Um.

DOCTOR X588
Is it hard?

PATIENT X588
xxxd down it's like okay.

DOCTOR X588
Okay don't bend down if you're gonna hurt yourself.

PATIENT X588
No but sometimes I have to do that because of the side, the whole thing.

DOCTOR X588
You can sit back up okay.

PATIENT X588
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X588
Okay.  I'll need to talk to.

PATIENT X588
But it's not the bending down so much it's this that bothers me, right you know like washing the sink when you wash the dishes or something, you tend to be very a little bit tilted.

DOCTOR X588
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X588
Lasts maybe 15 seconds or so.

DOCTOR X588
Yeah I'll be back.

PATIENT X588

DOCTOR X588
Oh.  Okay and I'll order the amitriptyline for you and you can try it and see and @@@ doesn't work you know.  But it is something that can be useful for neuropathic pain if you don't want to take the, the gabapentin @@@.  You don't want to take that, that's why then we can try something else.  

PATIENT X588
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X588

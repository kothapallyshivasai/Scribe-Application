DOCTOR X366
What do you understand about everything that's going on?

PATIENT X366
I don't know, that's why I wanted to see you.  You tell me what to do.  I had and they tell me and I just told them to set up an appointment for me to come here and uh on the 29th I've got to have this head scan or what they doing for the head and uh.

DOCTOR X366
The 29th of uh.

PATIENT X366
This month, this month.

DOCTOR X366
An MRI.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X366
What's this doing?  Then next she called me and said I need to make the appointment to do this biopsy.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
And that one's the next month.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah, really.  

PATIENT X366
And they put this up to you and I had this special ladder, even when I get up to the steps.  I don't know what they trying to do to me, what do you think?

DOCTOR X366
Well it's because they saw this thing in your, in your lungs.

PATIENT X366
Yeah it's been there a long time.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
That's what they told me, we been checking it for a long time but now they said it moved some or something.

DOCTOR X366
So when we got this other one in July, you know to follow up, because you had a 2 x 1 cm sized mass in the right upper lobe of your lung.  So the top part of your right lung.  This was new since previous exams uh and then that's when they recommended that maybe you needed a PET scan which is another CT scan.

PATIENT X366
Yeah I said I'd go up for that.

DOCTOR X366
Um I don't think they noticed this before that time.

PATIENT X366
Yeah it's been since, that's been since 95, 96, it's been a long time.  Last September it was sitting there all the time.  Except one time it was six months then they went to a year to check it.

DOCTOR X366
Is that right?

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
But they're saying that it wasn't there before.

PATIENT X366
Yeah it's been there since 96, 95 I think DOCTOR started checking that out.

DOCTOR X366
Here at the VA?

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
Okay.

PATIENT X366
I told them that uh to go back and it's been there but then they said it moved or something or other.

DOCTOR X366
Uh they're saying it's new because it's moved.

PATIENT X366
Yeah it moved or something but no we've been checking that for a long time.  It's been there and what not.

DOCTOR X366
And I read their note cause this is beyond me you know.

PATIENT X366
It is?

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.  These are people that, if there's something they see that's abnormal they take control and so it's uh a cancer doctor DOCTOR and lung doctor, DOCTOR you'll see them.

PATIENT X366
Yeah man we @@@ I'm on my last leg or something.  Gee whiz, a guy, you could let your daughters know, your children know and boom, boom, boom, like huh?  And I just kept quiet.  Why do they want to talk to the doctor, she called me and she called me.

DOCTOR X366
@@@ is when they first talk about it.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.  Man.  It's when they went into my @@@ July 19 I'm thinking.  Then they send me to X-Ray.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
Then they saw something in the x-ray and send me to CAT scan and then they saw something then it wasn't nothing they could reach then they send me out to the other place out in xxx to it was a. 

DOCTOR X366
A PET scan.

PATIENT X366
PET scan and it tell more then I go and take this breathing thing for the you know here and.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah that's what happened so, you had it before but now it's bigger.  That's what it is.  So even though it was slow it's gotten bigger and that's what concerned them.  I'm reading it right now.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
And they wanted to talk about it but @@@ you used to smoke.

PATIENT X366
Yeah a long time ago.

DOCTOR X366
A CT scan of July just to look at it and they saw the 2 x 1 cm mass.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
Then they compared it to a CT that had been back in 2005.

PATIENT X366
Yeah what's that, back in 2005.

DOCTOR X366
And looking back at it, it was @@@.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
But now it's bigger and that's worrisome that it grew, @@@ it grow.  If it was stable it wouldn't have grown that much, that's why.

PATIENT X366
Yeah but what would make it grow?

DOCTOR X366
But that's what they're worried that if it's a malignant cancer that's the only reason something like that would grow.

PATIENT X366
But shouldn't I have some kind of symptom or something you know to.

DOCTOR X366
No, no you're right.  You would be weak and would have probably more of a cough.  You'd probably feel you know like you're not gaining weight.  Let me look at your weight.

PATIENT X366
No and I know what, I know the weight change, I know what's wrong with the weight.

DOCTOR X366
You've lost weight or you've gained weight?

PATIENT X366
I've lost weight.  I knew this.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
But doc see, I know I weighed 160-165 no more but I'm trying to get, my normal weight is 160-65.

DOCTOR X366
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X366
See but I, after some years I got older I kept gaining a little more weight so like where I can stay home more and eat more but now I'm trying to down see the number on my pants is 34.

DOCTOR X366
@@@.

PATIENT X366
I'm down to 34 just about.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
So I got to be around 160, I used to be 160-165.

DOCTOR X366
Hmm.

PATIENT X366
To be my 34.

DOCTOR X366
Okay.  I could talk to your daughter and I'll try to call her like in the afternoons.  It's kind of hard for me to call in the afternoon but.

PATIENT X366
I know.

DOCTOR X366
But, so they're saying that this could be consistent with cancer and that's why they wanted to get the PET scan to see if it's spreading and the PET scan that shows that you have some findings also in the middle of your chest, not just on the right and something right over your kidney.  That doesn't mean that you have the cancer but there's sure something there.  So at this point they feel that the only way they can confirm if it's cancer or not is to get a sample of it.

PATIENT X366
Yes.

DOCTOR X366
So that's what they're recommended to you.  That's what you know DOCTOR.

PATIENT X366
Right.

DOCTOR X366
And he told you that he recommended the biopsy.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
And you agreed right?

PATIENT X366
Right, right, you know it doesn't matter to me cause I just had, I have no kind of symptom but you know I read through it and like I say when I said, when I gained weight like past the 160 or 65 you know I get very short then.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X366
And it was like uh I can't carry a lot of weight cause I get it up here.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
And then so I can't carry weight up here.

DOCTOR X366
So I think it's worth investigating.  You know obviously you already said yes.

PATIENT X366
Yeah I already said yes, yeah I did.

DOCTOR X366
@@@.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
I need to just apologize cause it sounds like they were telling you you're on your last leg.  I really don't want you to feel like that.

PATIENT X366
Oh no, I just but he itself, you know he.

DOCTOR X366
I think they just wanted to let your family know.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
And then, just so they could be ready.  It could be nothing, it could be something.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
But information, I think that's what it is.  Maybe that's what DOCTOR wanted to say, let your family know.

PATIENT X366
Hmm.

DOCTOR X366
You know, just so they know because the next thing you know if something does happen why were they doing this, why did this happen?

PATIENT X366
Hmm.

DOCTOR X366
You know.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
I think that's all it is.  I think he just wants your daughter to know everything that's going on.

PATIENT X366
I think she talked to DOCTOR about it already.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah he did but she also wanted to talk to me about it.

PATIENT X366
Yeah I think so.

DOCTOR X366
Okay.  So I'll try to call her today or tomorrow.

PATIENT X366
Hmm.  Yeah you can call her anytime but she's home for sure if you call her in the afternoon.

DOCTOR X366
Okay.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
Okay well then what we'll do and this biopsy is scheduled for when do you know?

PATIENT X366
The 11th of September.

DOCTOR X366
The 11th of September.

PATIENT X366
Yeah I just talked with the nurse yeah what I got to do.

DOCTOR X366
And you're on Coumadin right?

PATIENT X366
Yeah she got to get it through the Lab you know when they take me off from the Coumadin.

DOCTOR X366
Maybe we'll start a Lovenox injection.  That way you wouldn't have to get as many through the hospital.

PATIENT X366
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X366
Because you know when you're on Warfarin.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
You have to stop it.

PATIENT X366
What.

DOCTOR X366
We still have to give you medications so you won't clot.

PATIENT X366
But they said I might take it before the.

DOCTOR X366
So the urologist did the.

PATIENT X366
No for the, no for the um right now for the @@@.  They just took me off, I didn't take nothing.  They haven't put me on nothing.

DOCTOR X366
Oh you didn't switch, is this for afib?

PATIENT X366
You just took me off for the six days.

DOCTOR X366
And he didn't give you injections or anything?

PATIENT X366
No they don't give me nothing.

DOCTOR X366
Let me see.  Let me look in my old notes.  It's only because of your heart.  You're heart, your irregular rhythm.

PATIENT X366
Right.

DOCTOR X366
That's why you're on Coumadin.

PATIENT X366
Yeah that's what happened.

DOCTOR X366
That was because of clots back in the day right.

PATIENT X366
Oh no, no, no, that was for the since they found out I had an irregular heartbeat.

DOCTOR X366
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
Okay so he @@@ to come off.

PATIENT X366
Yeah that's what he said except for days within that date, they might have to give me the shots or something like that.  I said well @@@ before you don't give me nothing and I was off for six days.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
So they had put me to sleep for this and that.  They gave me anesthesia and all that stuff.

DOCTOR X366
So how you doing with the?

PATIENT X366
Prostate.

DOCTOR X366

PATIENT X366

DOCTOR X366
You're doing okay and your voiding trial was okay right?

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah alright.  Your blood pressure.

PATIENT X366

DOCTOR X366
Alright stay right there, don't move.  

PATIENT X366
Now that ain't got nothing with the blood pressure.

DOCTOR X366
And you've been taking all your medications today?

PATIENT X366
Yeah and then we know what it takes.

DOCTOR X366
Move your legs.

PATIENT X366
You know I only take the lisinopril once a day, 30.

DOCTOR X366
Alright.

PATIENT X366
Yeah I woke up this morning and that's what I take this morning.

DOCTOR X366
And you took it this morning right?

PATIENT X366
Yeah before I took my medicine.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
And it was 180 something over 1 something.

DOCTOR X366
And did you um, you didn't change your medications.  You've been on this for a while right?

PATIENT X366
Yeah @@@ from the @@@.

DOCTOR X366
Alright.  Just relax.  Alright.

PATIENT X366
Now it's 200 huh?

DOCTOR X366
Yeah it's like 160.

PATIENT X366
Oh then it's gone down some, it was 181 or 182 when she was taking.  It was 180 something I took it before I took my medicine.  I took it in the morning around 9 o'clock.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
It goes like that.  So then it goes all the way till it gets numb.  @@@ keep looking.  Anyway I took it again it'd be down to like 130 and then 130, 120 and sometime I take it it'll be 160.  Take my meds and it'll go down to 140, 130.  It's gone down some already cause it was 187 when she took it.

DOCTOR X366
Let's see what I got for you last time.  We've been battling this.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.  @@@ medicine, then after a while you've check it later on so it went down.

DOCTOR X366
Lisinopril 30 mg right?

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
And when I took it then it was 120-128.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.  So what should I do?

DOCTOR X366
You been checking it at home?

PATIENT X366
I check it at home every so often.  I just @@@.

DOCTOR X366
And what was it like?

PATIENT X366
Oh I didn't check for a while.  I been here, like I said sometimes I get up before I take the medicine it's 160 or 170 or something like that.  I take my medicine and about three hours later check it and it's down to 140, 130, 134 stuff like that and if I stay around long enough it goes down to 128 and stuff like that.  So actually it's kind of a weird.  Like I said the only time I feel bad is when it goes below 120.  When it go down like in the 105 and stuff like that then I get a little off balance but other than that I feel fine.

DOCTOR X366
Oh your blood pressure was high even before the operation.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.  Before the surgery they did, that what they do.

DOCTOR X366
Were on hydrochlorothiazide before?

PATIENT X366
Uh some time ago yeah, yeah they said I should actually take nothing than that stuff.  It was going too low at night; it was going down to the 80s.  Yeah going down to 80s yeah take me off the meds man.  It'd get me kind of woozy at night, off balance.  During daytime or like nighttime.

DOCTOR X366
I think we might have to go back up on your lisinopril.

PATIENT X366
I, they at 30.

DOCTOR X366
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X366
Yeah what is that 10, 20, then they got 30.

DOCTOR X366
So the lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, so continue b.i.d.

PATIENT X366
And they changed my urine type medicine, the prostate cause we just had too much.

DOCTOR X366
Who stopped your hydrochlorothiazide?  I did?

PATIENT X366
Yeah.  You stopped that and you changed my prostate medicine here for the urine tract.

DOCTOR X366
Yeah.

PATIENT X366
You got that stopped, you changed that too.  That's when I had to go back to GU cause it started interfering with my tract so I went back to GU.

DOCTOR X366
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X366
They put me on something.

DOCTOR X366
I think, let me see what I'm gonna do alright, I'll be back.

PATIENT X366

DOCTOR X366
Okay.

PATIENT X366

PATIENT X366
No if it goes low sometimes @@@.

DOCTOR X366
Really.

PATIENT X366
Yeah.

DOCTOR X366
Do you drink coffee or something?

PATIENT X366
No I drink coffee in the morning, that's all.  That's what bothers me sometimes it go down low at night so it goes down too low to me and I get uh.

DOCTOR X366
Lightheaded.

PATIENT X366
Lightheaded, off balance like you know.

DOCTOR X366
Uh-huh.  But then you're still high in the morning.

PATIENT X366
Yeah that's what I know I'm so high in the morning.

DOCTOR X366
And even before your surgery you were high.

PATIENT X366
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X366
You know I looked at the surgery and you had pressures of 180.

PATIENT X366
They saw it they needed to check it and see.

DOCTOR X366
Well they checked but they didn't care.  They were just doing their urological.

PATIENT X366
Yeah it wasn't @@@.  Yeah.  That's what I say @@@ you know it gets too low in the evening time and I told the one nurse she said as long as it don't go below the 90s too much you know, try to keep it around 100 at least and.

DOCTOR X366
What else do you do in the morning that's different from the night that you go so low?  Do you take the lisinopril again at night?

PATIENT X366
No I'm supposed to take it at night I have to take it twice a day.

DOCTOR X366
What time in the morning do you take your pills?

PATIENT X366
About 9 o'clock.

DOCTOR X366

When do you eat lunch?

PATIENT X366
I only eat one meal a day mostly.

DOCTOR X366
One meal a day?

PATIENT X366
Yeah @@@.  I don't eat that often.  That's why; if I eat I gain too much weight.  If I eat breakfast then I got to eat something at noontime or something like that and then I'll be hungry before that.  So if I can do without breakfast in the morning then I can go all day without eating.

DOCTOR X366

PATIENT X530
No, no.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Okay they're going through the groin and that's when you left.

PATIENT X530
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Okay so they felt it was something they needed to do.  Um and then for the last week you haven't had any.

PATIENT X530
Well just uh, not really maybe gas it seemed like but I could be wrong but it doesn't feel like when I had the severe blockage in the @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
It felt right.  Have you been doing anything like where your heart beats faster like walking upstairs or anything like, what have you been doing, do you have to walk up any stairs, anything like that?

PATIENT X530
No.  You know oh @@@ more sometimes and I'll be walking more.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Just walking on flat ground.

PATIENT X530
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Have you done anything in the last week where you would have to uh, where your heart would have to pound, beat harder, no stairs.  What about your apartment?  Are you on the first floor, elevator?

PATIENT X530
First floor.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
First floor okay.  Um right.  Alright I'm going to try and figure out what to do for this gentleman.  Um you know without having seen any of the test results we're just hearing it from you so we got to figure out and you know really we know, we know that the big picture is we need to get some of those test results or repeat them ourselves um and then we have to figure out what the right thing is for you, you know treatment wise and the other thing we have to decide on is how dangerous is the situation really is.  Do we need to um you know do all this today or can we wait um and you know it's a little hard to say.  You've been doing okay for the last week um but we don't want anything bad to happen.

PATIENT X530
@@@ with the heart is I know @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
@@@ right.

PATIENT X530
Cause like now I feel fine.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
You feel fine.

PATIENT X530
And I know if I been you know when it get to the point where it's not right, I know @@@ get me to the hospital @@@ like something's really going on.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Right.

PATIENT X530
The problem down in Springfield, I couldn't really you know and they told me, you know I couldn't stand up straight.  I knew that something was really going on wrong there and I went to the hospital and I, like I say I had surgery.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
When you were at xxx xxx last, how long was that now, it's been uh.

PATIENT X530
About two weeks.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Two weeks alright.  When you were at xxx xxx um how bad did they say it was?

PATIENT X530
They, okay they said they did find a small blockage.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Small blockage.

PATIENT X530
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
And they wanted to go in there again and put in like more stents or something?

PATIENT X530
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
But you did not have a heart attack the second time.

PATIENT X530
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
There was no heart attack when you were there.

PATIENT X530
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Blockage.

PATIENT X530
@@@ I had a heart attack.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Right, right, they said you had a blockage.  Um so we had no, I'm trying to figure out one option is that we could call the surgery fellow now.  We probably should @@@ surgery I mean the Cardiology fellow.  I think what we should do is call the Cardiology fellow now and ask them what they recommend we do cause I want to make sure we get this right.  You know on the one hand he knows his body well and he's saying that you know he's okay now.  On the other hand the problem is sometimes you know you can get a sudden blood clot in a narrow vessel and that can be deadly, like with no warning and we don't want that to happen to you.

PATIENT X530
Right I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X530
Well yeah kind of like an embolism or it could be just, an embolism or it could be just a piece of um tissue inside the artery basically that just breaks away and can cause a blockage and that can happen in people with heart disease which is why sometimes people die suddenly.  Um it's unlikely to happen but um.

PATIENT X530
It can.

SECOND DOCTOR X530

He had a 99% lesion when he came in, he came back two weeks ago with a no MI at xxx xxx but with um evidence of you know some partial blockage um that now has been okay for a week, no symptoms um but uh we kind of want to get their advice of whether we need to do something today or whether we can have him come in for testing and also the fact to become, it would be nice to get the results from xxx xxx.  We're gonna want those results soon to get those sent over here and we could have him sign a release here.

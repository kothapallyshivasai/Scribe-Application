DOCTOR X502

PATIENT X502
Good morning.

DOCTOR X502
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X502
Hello DOCTOR, nice to meet you.

DOCTOR X502
@@@.

PATIENT X502
Okay no more DOCTOR?

DOCTOR X502
Oh um, he's just not here today.  He'll be back next week.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Um so I'm taking his place.

PATIENT X502
Pardon me?

DOCTOR X502
Oh he scheduled you so you'll see him on your next visit.

PATIENT X502
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR X502
Um.

PATIENT X502
And we're being recorded okay.

DOCTOR X502
Oh okay.  Do you record all your visits?

PATIENT X502
No it's just that some program is going on I guess DOCTOR agreed to it so since he's not here.

DOCTOR X502
Oh okay.  Um I know what you're referring to.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
So now I'm part of it as well.

PATIENT X502
Okay good.  So we're okay with that?

DOCTOR X502
Yeah sure.

PATIENT X502
Good.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  How are things going since you're last visit?

PATIENT X502
Not good, not good, not good because you know as you can see I came in for a knee problem.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
Uh I had uh whatcha call that ultrasound back here because there was a cyst back here.

DOCTOR X502
Right.

PATIENT X502
Okay and then so the knee is still giving me a lot of problems.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
They took x-rays of it but see I never heard and then like they said they were gonna contact me and let me know what the x-ray was okay but they never did and my knee still hurts.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
It hurts like a son-of-a-gun.  I don't know if it's cracked bone or if it's displaced or what you know.

DOCTOR X502
Sure.

PATIENT X502
But see they didn't call and let me know and that wasn't fair.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  So the test you're referring to originally you had on March 15th?

PATIENT X502
I don't know what day it was.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  Uh was that when you came in to Urgent Care?

PATIENT X502
Okay then I came back again.

DOCTOR X502
Right.

PATIENT X502
They took x-rays of it this time.  Do you have enough there for me?

DOCTOR X502
No I do yeah.

PATIENT X502
Okay.  Well they @@@.

DOCTOR X502
Was that the time you came in in the middle of February.

PATIENT X502
It was the 6th.

DOCTOR X502
It was the 5th and then you came in because you still had pain.

PATIENT X502
Right.

DOCTOR X502
On March 15th.

PATIENT X502
Now do I have any broken bones?

DOCTOR X502
Uh let's look.

PATIENT X502
See I don't know nothing you know.

DOCTOR X502
I apologize that they didn't call.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Um. 

PATIENT X502
See I don't know, like I said all I know is that my knee hurts, it still hurts.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
I don't have a brace, no cane or nothing you know, they just ship me out there.

DOCTOR X502
Point to where the pain is.

PATIENT X502
When I walk, the whole area.

DOCTOR X502
The whole area, so there's not one area in particular?

PATIENT X502
No, no, especially when I'm walking.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
And I don't have a brace.  Well really I can't afford a brace.

DOCTOR X502
We can give you one.

PATIENT X502
Thank you.

DOCTOR X502
So it looks like they saw some preventative things that were consistent with old age.  Your bones getting older.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
And then they saw that um small calcified area which could be the same area as where the cyst is.  I don't know if the cyst is in there.

PATIENT X502
That's in the back of the knee there right?

DOCTOR X502
It's in the back of the knee.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Um which is where the same place that it's showing on the x-ray.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
So it is on the ultrasound.

PATIENT X502
But no broken bones?

DOCTOR X502
No broken bones.

PATIENT X502
Okay.  Just old age setting in right?

DOCTOR X502
Yeah and then this little cyst that you have.

PATIENT X502
It's still there?

DOCTOR X502
Uh well at least on the 15th it was still there.

PATIENT X502
Because they say it had busted and the fluid was running down my leg and that's what by checking the tissue that's what brought the pain on.

DOCTOR X502
Um.

PATIENT X502
So that's what they told me what the ultrasound said okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
You know I mean I want the truth, that's all I want you know.

DOCTOR X502
Sure.  I understand completely.  Um, let me look at your ultrasound.  Okay so after your appointment, after you had the ultrasound.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
They told you there was a cyst there or they told you that it burst?

PATIENT X502
It bursted.

DOCTOR X502
Okay um.

PATIENT X502
And the fluid running down.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  Did you feel it?

PATIENT X502
That's what started.  No.

DOCTOR X502
Oh.

PATIENT X502
I felt the pain.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
Okay and now it's like I feel the pain when I'm walking but I also feel my bones, you know what I mean like man.

DOCTOR X502
Right.

PATIENT X502
It doesn't feel good doc.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  Well so on the ultrasound um it shows that there's a cyst there.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
I don't see that it, so if it could have popped between now and then but when you had the ultrasound done on the 19th there was a cyst there.

PATIENT X502
There was a cyst there.

DOCTOR X502
Yes.

PATIENT X502
And it bursted because they said that if the cyst was there they could go on in and draw the fluid out.

DOCTOR X502
Sometimes.  It depends on how big it is and if it's not very big.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
Then you know sometimes the risk of the procedure doesn't weigh out the benefit.

PATIENT X502
Okay we're cool.

DOCTOR X502
But your body will eventually, you know.

PATIENT X502
Okay I understand.

DOCTOR X502
Take care of it on its own.

PATIENT X502
But why, let me understand, why did they tell me it burst and fluid running down, that's why the pain in there because the fluid's pushing tissue?

DOCTOR X502
I'm not sure.

PATIENT X502
You see?

DOCTOR X502
I can't answer that.

PATIENT X502
Right, you see and it wasn't necessary to tell a story about that you know and I have to be concerned about my health now you know.  So I'm not trying to put you in the ballgame here, I just want fair answers.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
That's all you know anyway.

DOCTOR X502
You're entitled to fair answers.

PATIENT X502
Right.

DOCTOR X502
Okay, so you taking anything for the pain?

PATIENT X502
I was taking Tylenol and then codeine with Tylenol before I went to bed but I don't have any more.  See I'm not working, I'm unemployed, I can't afford it so usually DOCTOR was providing a prescription for me.

DOCTOR X502
So even before you would come in you were taking the Tylenol.

PATIENT X502
Right.

DOCTOR X502
Not the pain medications.

PATIENT X502
No I didn't have any then.  I came in right away when it started pain.

DOCTOR X502
And how often are you taking them?

PATIENT X502
Don't have anymore.

DOCTOR X502
But when you were, when you did have them how often were you taking them?

PATIENT X502
Uh well as needed.  

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
I guess that's not saying much is it uh I would say.

DOCTOR X502
Once a day?

PATIENT X502
Once a day, once a day as far as the codeine because of the pain.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
And when I was walking today I was taking them during the daytime so yes.  The Tylenol with codeine I was taking about I'd say every other, maybe every two days.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
And I was taking them at night.

DOCTOR X502
Did they make you sleepy?

PATIENT X502
Yeah but.

DOCTOR X502
Yeah.

PATIENT X502
Some good sleep.

DOCTOR X502
Okay how are you doing on your other medications?

PATIENT X502

DOCTOR X502

PATIENT X502

DOCTOR X502
Okay so are they sending you the finasteride then?

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
And okay, are you still smoking cigarettes?

PATIENT X502
I never was much of a smoker so I don't know why they have that there.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  Well they have weekly that you smoke.

DOCTOR X502
Method?

PATIENT X502
Smoke.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  Any interest in cutting back on any of this?

PATIENT X502
Well I don't do it that much, if I cut back then I'll say I don't do it, that's just how frequent it is okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
It's not like its.

DOCTOR X502
Well as your physician.

PATIENT X502
I understand.

DOCTOR X502
I would prefer that you would not do it.

PATIENT X502
But @@@ either.

DOCTOR X502
I understand, I appreciate that.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
If you're going to use your Levitra I would not, I would suggest that you don't use cocaine anytime around that period.

PATIENT X502
Right, right, right, right, right, right so.  And then when I do that, that's just like maybe on New Year's, you know 4th of July, something like that.  Just when the Super Bowl you know when the guys.

DOCTOR X502
Special occasions.

PATIENT X502
Right you know and then it's not like a all night affair.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
You know.  I love my, I know how important my health is okay.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
So but then that's just the thing because I'm not gonna lie to you you know.  I'm not a heavy user or anything.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.  So everything looks okay.  Your blood pressure looks good.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
Your cholesterol looks good.  Um your kidneys got slightly worse but we're still, there's nothing that we would do differently.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
As far as the management on it.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
The main thing is to; the medications you take help prevent your kidneys from getting worse.

PATIENT X502
Right, what's that.

DOCTOR X502
The lisinopril?

PATIENT X502
Is that right?

DOCTOR X502
It's good for your blood pressure and it also helps protect your kidneys.

PATIENT X502
Good but that's the thing I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
I do, I mean I do it every day.  I drink a lot of water.  It doesn't, not gonna work against me is it?

DOCTOR X502
No.

PATIENT X502
Okay good.

DOCTOR X502
Okay and then you had a colonoscopy in 2006.

PATIENT X502
Yeah.

DOCTOR X502
And it was normal so we don't have to repeat it and then you saw the urologist in February and they said just follow up in one year.

PATIENT X502
Okay.  Now I got a question to ask you cause see.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
When I saw the urologist last, he said I got kind of scared there because I had to go back for my what's that reading called, the P.

DOCTOR X502
You had the ultrasound and you had the biopsy.

PATIENT X502
Yeah but it's a reading that that of the prostate.

DOCTOR X502
The PSA?

PATIENT X502
PSA okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
And so like they were checking on that you know to see if I had cancer or not cause it was kind of high then I think you know.  But now I ask you this, even though you're not a urologist.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
I've heard that there's a cure for prostate cancer.

DOCTOR X502
There's treatment for it.  You can do surgery, you can do radiation and you can get chemotherapy depending on um how bad it is, where it is.

PATIENT X502
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X502
On what needs to be done.

PATIENT X502
But mine being in the position where like it's being checked on.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
It shouldn't get that far gone.

DOCTOR X502
Correct.

PATIENT X502
I mean all I have to do is just kind of let you know what's happening right.

DOCTOR X502
Right, so what happens is that in general we um we used to use the PSA test.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
More so we found over the recent years that it's not a great screening test for prostate cancer.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Unlike colon cancer you know where you can go and look with a camera.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
And you can see and you can take out a polyp right away.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
Um you know the PSA is just a blood test.

PATIENT X502
Right.

DOCTOR X502
So um you know there are patients who have a low PSA.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
With prostate cancer, they can show a high PSA and have prostate cancer so it's not a great test.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
So that's why, when it's high um you know you kind of have to weigh the risks and benefit of doing a biopsy.

PATIENT X502
Okay, okay, okay.

DOCTOR X502
Or if you want to go down that route.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
But sometimes prostate cancer can be very slow growing and so just the fact that we now have this test.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
And we're checking earlier.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
Um it doesn't necessarily mean that we're improved.  Changing the duration of your life per say.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
But just that we're being more invasive about how we check things and how we do things.

PATIENT X502
You see it's like, see my father died of prostate cancer.

DOCTOR X502
How old was he?

PATIENT X502
69.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
Okay and uh the reason being @@@ I was just so very angry with the VA you know and it was a long time before I trusted the VA or even got seen.  He was at xxx.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
And they knew he had cancer and sent him to the county.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
And that wasn't fair and I detested the VA for that you know.  Never trusted them again but I mean I'm okay with that now you know because that's years gone back, I need the VA care and all that but if I didn't like the VA I'd go to the county, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR X502
Right.

PATIENT X502
But because I want to go where I'm comfortable.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
See.  Excuse me @@@ and I'm comfortable here with @@@ doctor has given me you know but this is just something I will never forget and the trust had to be I mean like I just didn't trust them but I'm okay now.  You know I explained that to the other doctors you know.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
So they were wrong for doing that to my father so and anyway.

DOCTOR X502
So you're being, I mean given that it runs in your family um then you know they're watching you more carefully.

PATIENT X502
Okay, okay, right.

DOCTOR X502
Typically you know 69 is still um, it's not unreasonable for somebody to have prostate cancer.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
It's you know cause everybody's living longer now.

PATIENT X502
Right.

DOCTOR X502
If you live long enough you'll eventually get some form of cancer.

PATIENT X502
Right, right.

DOCTOR X502
Somewhere.

PATIENT X502
Right, right, right, right.

DOCTOR X502
Um but in your case the urologist just wants you to check in with them every year, we'll get that test done.

PATIENT X502
Okay good, good, good.

DOCTOR X502
So I'm sure they told you but your prostate biopsy was negative.

PATIENT X502
Right.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
Yes.  Yes.  Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay so um, let's see @@@ the insulin. 

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
How are your allergies?

PATIENT X502
I was going to ask you @@@ have a little rash up in here or something.  It @@@ cream.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.  Okay take a deep breath for me and out again.  Sounds good.  Lay down for me.  Does it hurt when I push on your knees?

PATIENT X502
Somewhat.

DOCTOR X502
Okay what about back here?

PATIENT X502
Somewhat I can feel it.

DOCTOR X502
Does it feel like pressure?

PATIENT X502
Yeah pressure, I can feel the pressure but the pain is on a scale of one or two.

DOCTOR X502
We'll look at this.

PATIENT X502
And you can see doctor this knee is still swollen.

DOCTOR X502
No that's okay.

PATIENT X502
Right in there where.

DOCTOR X502
Right here where I'm pushing?

PATIENT X502
Right.

DOCTOR X502
Yeah it's real open when I push there.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Usually in here, give me your hand, can you feel behind your leg.

PATIENT X502
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X502
That little, it gives a little.

PATIENT X502
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X502
And when you feel behind your right leg.

PATIENT X502
Okay, okay, right, right, right.  So it's just @@@ there.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
Okay, okay, okay, alright.

DOCTOR X502
Yeah I agree.  There's nothing we would do in terms of draining it.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Your body will naturally absorb the fluid.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
It will go away.

PATIENT X502
@@@.

DOCTOR X502
How long that takes, everyone's different.

PATIENT X502
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X502
Yeah so you know you could have it for a while and it could be gone in a few weeks.

PATIENT X502
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X502
It's hard to say.

PATIENT X502
Okay well doc you know what, I see I do exercise a lot.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
But yeah I do the treadmill.  I don't go fast; you know I don't run, because I can't run no way.  I go at a steady pace and then for about, I do it for 20 minutes.  Okay the first 10 minutes I'm like this okay and then for like the next five minutes, which @@@ I turn it up two notches but then the last five minutes I decrease.

DOCTOR X502
Okay, so is it making the pain worse when you do that?

PATIENT X502
No.

DOCTOR X502
It doesn't bother you at all?

PATIENT X502
No, no.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
No and then when I get off then here come the pain again.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
So.

DOCTOR X502
Um.

PATIENT X502
But now they have a little cycle you know.

DOCTOR X502
Yeah.

PATIENT X502
I do that but slow.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
You know is that okay?

DOCTOR X502
Yeah I mean its all okay.  It could be though that you know all the exercise you're doing with the bending of the knee could be irritating it a little bit so it's making it harder for the, you know for the fluid to reabsorb.  So you might want to lay off of it for a few weeks and see if it doesn't go down.

PATIENT X502
So leave the treadmill alone.

DOCTOR X502
Um well it's better to do a sitting bike.

PATIENT X502
Like I have been.

DOCTOR X502
Although the biking is still, you're still gonna be moving your knee.

PATIENT X502
Okay so now they have two kinds.  The have the type with the bicycle one like this.

DOCTOR X502
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X502
And then they have a cycle to go like this.

DOCTOR X502
The cycle sitting, laying would be better.

PATIENT X502
Okay.  No pain.

DOCTOR X502
Um at least until this heals a little bit uh but you're still, it means you're still gonna have the constant motion on.

PATIENT X502
On the treadmill.

DOCTOR X502
Can you swim at all?

PATIENT X502
Can I swim?

DOCTOR X502
Yeah.

PATIENT X502
I don't have a swimming pool or nothing.

DOCTOR X502
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X502
So stay off the treadmill.

DOCTOR X502
So let's try it for a few weeks and see if it doesn't help decrease the fluid in there.

PATIENT X502
But pick up the cycling.

DOCTOR X502
If you want to do exercise, try doing the cycle where you're sitting down.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay and or you could try doing other things with your arms or @@@.

PATIENT X502
I do.

DOCTOR X502
And do that instead.

PATIENT X502
I was thinking of what @@@.

DOCTOR X502
No weights on the legs though.

PATIENT X502
No.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Let's give the leg a rest.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
And see if it doesn't improve.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

PATIENT X502
Alright.

DOCTOR X502
You can sit up.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay, just give me a few minutes I'll be right back.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

DOCTOR X502
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:40  DOCTOR IN:  77:48)

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Hello.

PATIENT X502
Hello there.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
How are you today?  I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT X502
Nice to meet you DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
That's a strong handshake you got there.  I @@@ so it's the left knee that bothers you?

PATIENT X502
The left knee yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Okay.  Can I look at it?

PATIENT X502
Sure excuse me.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Where does it hurt, is it just all the way across, around?

PATIENT X502
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
And they noted the calcifications on the lateral side right?

FIRST DOCTOR X502
Posterolateral.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Can you straighten your leg for me.  Well at any rate it doesn't look like anything that was serious.  It @@@ ligamentous or calcified loose body so I don't that's anything to be worried about but it could be causing some discomfort okay.  I don't.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
I mean it's very small but if you compare it and feel it on the right you'll feel that.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
That's possible.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
It almost feels fatty.

PATIENT X502
Fatty.  Nobody's ever said it's just fat.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
No it's probably fluid, but that's what it feels like yeah.  It's not @@@, its fluid in here.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
You can feel when I'm touching it.

PATIENT X502
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
But it feels very fatty.  It's fluid.

PATIENT X502
But its fluid.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
That's the way cysts happen I mean yeah.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Like no that fluid, did not want to go, you know its inside and it would not ever.

PATIENT X502
No kidding, why didn't they tell me that?

SECOND DOCTOR X502
I don't know, that was kind of a silly thing to say to you.  That's not, I mean I don't know exactly what they said but.

PATIENT X502
Okay, okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
But it's @@@.

PATIENT X502
No I understand that.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
But the other thing is do you eat a lot of foods that are high in potassium like green leafy vegetables @@@.

PATIENT X502
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Well the only thing is your potassium is a little too high.

PATIENT X502
It going too high?

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Yeah so maybe we could back down a little bit.

PATIENT X502
Okay now what food has potassium in it, I have to watch that right?

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Yeah.

PATIENT X502
Cause I ate about four bananas yesterday.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Yeah so not too much.  That's what I'm saying is potassium is good for you but too much of it can affect your heart because that potassium is part of the cycle the heart rate @@@ uh is affected by potassium, sodium, things all found in food.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
So like naturally if it gets too much actually it.

PATIENT X502
So now I have to go look up what foods have high potassium, there you go thank you very much.  Watch this.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
I might have something here.

PATIENT X502
Because I had a test done to see how my potassium was.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
And I want to recheck it today so that was in February so I'll make sure it's still not running low.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
You're fine.

PATIENT X502
And then I won't see you no more for about.  Well I'll tell you what, why don't I take a test about a couple weeks before I come back in again, by that way we can tell.  If you check it now I'll have to come back in four or five months.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
Oh but it's high now.

PATIENT X502
Oh.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
We'll have to make adjustments to your medications.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
For some things that's a good idea but if we're worried about what it is today we should probably have it.

PATIENT X502
Okay.  Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
So this is a list of high potassium foods so you should avoid those things.  There's nothing you have to, so just don't go over the top.

PATIENT X502
Over the top.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Stop any time.

PATIENT X502
Potatoes?  I love potatoes.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Well just not too much.

PATIENT X502
Just not all the time.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Just watch them.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Yeah.  @@@ as soon as you can and I mean if it comes back down you know you can.

PATIENT X502
Okay, so.  I miss things @@@ but I'm gonna follow your direction.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
And you, it's not like you actually you're allowed some of these.

PATIENT X502
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
So if back down a little for long and we'll see how it goes.

PATIENT X502
Okay, okay, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X502
But first @@@ okay.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
It just so happens that there was too much potassium.

PATIENT X502
Okay I can do that.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
Okay I think DOCTOR's got a good plan for you.

PATIENT X502
Thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR X502
It was nice meeting you.

PATIENT X502
Likewise.

SECOND DOCTOR X502

FIRST DOCTOR X502
Okay so your blood pressure's well controlled on the lisinopril and @@@.

PATIENT X502
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X502

PATIENT X502
Okay now okay.  Am I gonna pick up anything at the Pharmacy?

FIRST DOCTOR X502
Yeah you're gonna pick up your Tylenol #3.

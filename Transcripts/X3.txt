DOCTOR X3
Hi.  

PATIENT X3
Hi.

DOCTOR X3
Aw come on, you @@@ blood pressure.

PATIENT X3
Okay.

DOCTOR X3
Have you been taking your medicines?


PATIENT X3
Yeah.


DOCTOR X3
Did you take them today?


PATIENT X3
Yes.


DOCTOR X3
Oh.  You look like you've gained some weight.


PATIENT X3
Maybe just.


DOCTOR X3
You look fuller in the face.


PATIENT X3
Yeah?


DOCTOR X3
Yeah.  Let me look at your legs today.  Oh your legs they look good.  @@@.  Now you look okay.  Maybe it's just me @@@.  You're okay.  What's up, what's new?


PATIENT X3
Not much.


DOCTOR X3
Nothing?  So you're taking your medicines for sure?


PATIENT X3
Yes.


DOCTOR X3
Oh.  So your weight from the last year.  Yeah I know you were trying to get down to 120 pounds, so that's up good.  Let me recheck your blood pressure.  Can you take off your jacket for me?  Okay, crawl up here.  Anything new at home?

PATIENT X3
No.  I guess that's the main thing.


DOCTOR X3
Do you have family coming here?  How many pills do you take for your blood pressure a day?


PATIENT X3
One.


DOCTOR X3
Supposed to be taking two, maybe that's why.  Did you run out of one?  You're supposed to be on.


PATIENT X3
Lisinopril.


DOCTOR X3
I might just stopped one of your pills cause your blood pressure was it low enough?  No?  Now your blood pressure has been high.  I want to know what happened.  You're supposed to be on two of them.

PATIENT X3
The one I take is refillable.


DOCTOR X3
Okay.  That is not as bad.  Let me do it on the other arm.  Any headaches, weakness, vision changes or anything like that?

PATIENT X3
Nope.


DOCTOR X3
Okay.  So they used to have you on uh two pills.


PATIENT X3
Yeah.


DOCTOR X3
And then I guess they took one of them off probably because you were low and you were dizzy too.  But, if you're, if it's really this high again I might have to start a new one.  Just relax your arm, relax it.  Cause actually that hydrochlorothiazide they now have a combo pill so I can give you one now that has a combination of two so, maybe that's a good option.  Okay.  Not bad.  Not as bad as too low yeah, better than.  Have you been eating high salt food or anything?  @@@.  High salt foods or anything like that?

PATIENT X3
Not that I know of.


DOCTOR X3
Swelling in your legs or anything like that?


PATIENT X3
No.

DOCTOR X3

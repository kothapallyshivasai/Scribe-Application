So it looks like its working okay for you right?

PATIENT X213
So far.

DOCTOR X213
That's good.  I look to see that, you look a little steadier to me.

PATIENT X213
I haven't felt it.  Um, it @@@ since I've fallen eight times in December.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
And I fell last night, I don't even know how.  I don't explain how I.

SECOND PERSON X213
How you fell?  You were just standing.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X213
I don't know if you took a drink or were going to and all of a sudden you just went down.

DOCTOR X213
Okay like blacked out, lost consciousness or?

SECOND PERSON X213
He doesn't remember it, cause he says what happened?

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X213
So he kind of fell backwards and he hit head.

PATIENT X213
Again.

SECOND PERSON X213
Again.

PATIENT X213
I put a hole in the one door.

DOCTOR X213
Hmm.

PATIENT X213
Hurt like heck.

DOCTOR X213
Back in December?

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  So last night you didn't have any sense like oh my gosh I'm gonna pass out.  You didn't feel palpitations or lightheaded or anything?

PATIENT X213
No, all of a sudden I was on the floor.

DOCTOR X213
All of a sudden you're on the floor okay and did anyone see it?  You saw it?

SECOND PERSON X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
Did it look like he passed out?

SECOND PERSON X213
It looked like; well actually he didn't know what happened.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X213
And it's as if he was awake.  I mean it was very fast, probably five seconds or so.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X213
So it wasn't like he kind fell on the kitchen floor when I said he really was unconscious.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.  Alright um.
SECOND PERSON X213
His coughing, choking is getting worse.

DOCTOR X213
Were you doing anything at the time that you passed out?

PATIENT X213
I was just staying calm as far as I know.

DOCTOR X213
So you weren't like drinking or eating anything or laughing?

SECOND PERSON X213
I don't know I was at the other end.

PATIENT X213
I don't think I was drinking anything cause I don't remember.

SECOND PERSON X213
Well you had a glass in front of you but I don't know if he actually too a drink or not.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
I don't remember.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  You didn't lose continence of your bowels or bladder and you didn't urinate on yourself?  You don't shake uncontrollably or anything?

SECOND PERSON X213
No.

PATIENT X213
No.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  And how's your head feel today?

PATIENT X213
My head feels, well sore where I hit it but my neck is worse @@@ real sore almost to the touch.  What was the third thing?  There was a third thing we were going to tell you and I forgot.  @@@.  But there's a third thing.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
And I still can't feel anything as you can tell right there.  I have no idea how I got that.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
This was bigger before, it's healed a little bit.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  

PATIENT X213
I have no idea how that happened.

DOCTOR X213
And how far up does it go, the feel.

PATIENT X213
The feeling?

DOCTOR X213
Feel yeah, I mean can you feel anything there?

PATIENT X213
No

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
I can't think of the third thing.  Oh even the therapist recommended I, suggested a wheelchair too.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah, they were recommending a wheelchair; I saw that in their notes.  Do you have one at home?

PATIENT X213
No we're gonna, I think we're gonna get one for when I walk long distances like here.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X213
Or like go to a mall or whatever.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.  Do you feel dizzy when that happens?  I mean do you.

PATIENT X213
Sometimes it takes me a while, when I stand up.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.

PATIENT X213
If I can get my blood flowing down to my legs.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X213
I think you should tell her about how you feel in the.

PATIENT X213
Oh yeah, there's been two times now where like I'll go over and I feel like I'm upside down.

DOCTOR X213
Upside down like?

PATIENT X213
I don't know, yeah everything seems like it's upside down.  I'll wake up and I'll feel like I'm off the bed and upside down.

DOCTOR X213
Okay, okay.

SECOND PERSON X213
It's more than two times cause he's had that before.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X213
Yeah.  And when he's in the car he feels like what things are.

PATIENT X213
Roller coaster.

SECOND PERSON X213
Like when you're going down?

PATIENT X213
Yeah I've mentioned that to her before that.

DOCTOR X213
Let's see.  

PATIENT X213
See I knew I'd make your day complicated.  But it seems like, I use a snow blower for the snows @@@, as long as I got that in front of me I seem to be okay.

DOCTOR X213
You mean when you walk?

PATIENT X213
Yeah as long as I got something in front of me to hold to.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.

PATIENT X213
But when I go use a cane I don't.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah, this is, I mean.

PATIENT X213
So I'm using @@@ right along side.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X213
Like the other day when I rode a bike to work I had two people @@@.  There was a slight little hill and it was a little bit slippery and they offered and so I took uptown.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  Alright why don't you come over here and.

PATIENT X213
We'll see what happens.  Let's see the last time @@@ feel like the roller coastering.

DOCTOR X213
I'm going to have you lay down okay?  @@@ like this.  Any chest pain or trouble breathing?

PATIENT X213
No.

DOCTOR X213
Okay, nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT X213
No.

DOCTOR X213
Okay, diarrhea, constipation?

PATIENT X213
Constipation means that the bowel movements get extremely big.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  Are you taking stool softeners right now?

PATIENT X213
No.  I can't tell, are my words slurred?

DOCTOR X213
It doesn't sound much worse than the last time that I saw you here.  Now put your left arm out for me.  

PATIENT X213
What's it at?

DOCTOR X213
That was 134/80.

PATIENT X213
Now it's come down some.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.  Now I'm going to have you sit up and we'll set you down and then I'm going to raise this leg okay.  Do you feel dizzy when you sit up?

PATIENT X213
A little, not too bad.

DOCTOR X213
Like the room is spinning or lightheadedness?

PATIENT X213
Lightheaded.

DOCTOR X213
Take a deep breath in and out.  

PATIENT X213
Where did you go over the holidays?

DOCTOR X213
Oh I was able to go home.

PATIENT X213
Oh that's good.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah it was nice.

PATIENT X213
You were on the east coast then.

DOCTOR X213
xxx xxx, New York.

PATIENT X213
Ooh you had a lot of snow.

DOCTOR X213
Not as much as uh like New York City and xxx, they are really.

PATIENT X213
Oh xxx's getting hit again.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.

PATIENT X213
My nephew goes to school in xxx and @@@ yesterday or today?

SECOND PERSON X213
I think it was yesterday.

PATIENT X213
Oh it was yesterday.

DOCTOR X213
xxx got four feet of snow in four days.

SECOND PERSON X213
Oh my gosh.

DOCTOR X213
Right before I arrived and then just as I was leaving was when that big blizzard was coming up the east coast and xxx and New York @@@.

SECOND PERSON X213
But you got out in time.

DOCTOR X213
I missed it, I got a nice white Christmas and I missed a lot of the actual snowfall.  So just relax your arm here.  Okay I'm going to @@@ blood pressure.  Okay.

PATIENT X213
What is it now?

DOCTOR X213
That was actually, it was 128/80 so.  Pretty darn close so that's good I mean.

PATIENT X213
There are worse.

DOCTOR X213
So your blood pressure doesn't seem to be dropping.  That would really explain.  Now normally when you pass out like that is it um, is it when you've been standing up for a while?

PATIENT X213
No actually I could be sitting.  Remember when I fell in the bedroom, I was sitting and I fell off the bed.

SECOND PERSON X213
Yeah but I, that was just a fall, I don't think it was like a loss of consciousness.

PATIENT X213
What if the medication is refilled that they won't let me refill it over the phone?

DOCTOR X213
Oh yeah we can.

PATIENT X213
Hopefully we can do it.  Oh shoot, she is going to do that, she's getting the glove.

DOCTOR X213
Oh, I'm just going to look at the back of your head here.  Do you have any pus or bleeding back here?

PATIENT X213
No, not that I know of.  @@@.  Up a little bit higher.

DOCTOR X213
A little bit higher.

PATIENT X213
Yeah right where your hand was, right in through there.

DOCTOR X213
There?

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
I don't see any cuts or anything.  Does that hurt when I'm pushing on it?

PATIENT X213
No.  Well this time it was a solid wall.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.

PATIENT X213
Last time it was the corner.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
I thought she was going to @@@.

DOCTOR X213
Alright.

PATIENT X213
She don't like to do that.

DOCTOR X213
The neurologist, alright you had a bunch of falls since the last time you saw the neurologist right?

SECOND PERSON X213
Yeah.

PATIENT X213
And it's just scary.

DOCTOR X213
What are you scared of?

PATIENT X213
When I fall and I don't know why I fall.

DOCTOR X213
Cause you don't get any warning right?

PATIENT X213
Right.

DOCTOR X213
Alright cause I think, I mean from what it sounds like, we've done a lot of tests, a lot of work-up for the falls, trying to figure out what's going on and we haven't had much luck determining exactly what the cause is.  We know we're thinking that's it's probably multifactorial, that there are a few different things contributing to the falls that we need to try to minimize the risks from a bunch of different things.  Um, without being able to make these episodes go away completely, I think the safest thing would probably be to have a wheelchair and just you know if you're sitting then it's not as hard to fall and that's basically.  I know it's an answer and it's not very satisfying but for now that'll minimize the risk of hurting yourself when you fall.  Um you know from things from my perspective as a medical doctor what we would worry about is your heart being related.  Like something like having stenosis, like a restriction in some of your heart valves which you don't have based on our labs when we checked your heart, um some sort of arrhythmia where your heart is going in and out of rhythm that would cause you to blackout but as far as we know that's not the case either.  Um we would worry about your blood pressure dropping and sometimes that can be a result of just having neurological problems, your body doesn't respond the same way to changes with position and kind of a.

PATIENT X213
Well what's kind of weird and everything has been the time of the day.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X213
It @@@ at night or in the morning or sometimes in the after you know I never know.

DOCTOR X213
Right.  Um but based on you know what we just did checking your blood pressure in different positions, it doesn't seem like your blood pressure is dropping when you sit up or stand up. Sometimes it's related, it's called vasal vagal and it's like from standing for long periods of time um so it's kind of hard to say.  But from a lot of the things that I'm used to managing and dealing with, we've kind of ruled those things out.

PATIENT X213
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X213
Um it may be partly related to some of the medications you're given um, helping one thing can sometimes just bring other problems and it may be related to the ataxia and you know the kind of syndrome of stuff you have going on that we're trying to get a handle on.  I don't know, I don't have any great answers for you, I wish I did.

SECOND PERSON X213
What's really hard for him now is he's choking so violently.  He'll @@@.  

DOCTOR X213
He'll turn red and.

SECOND PERSON X213
Yeah and once he just gets through this thing he seems to be okay.  It's just like that first swallows are really violent.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.  Are you, I saw that you went back and got another swallow evaluation.

SECOND PERSON X213
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X213
Are you using the @@@?

PATIENT X213
@@@.

DOCTOR X213
@@@.

PATIENT X213
Even when I drink I try to make sure I'm over the table or something.

SECOND PERSON X213
I try to encourage him to take smaller bites and to chew it better.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X213
@@@.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  Yeah, I mean.

PATIENT X213
Or even when it's plain, like we had soup and that went down real easy and I was even coughing with that real bad.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah soup is actually hard because it's a mixture of consistencies.  When you've got stuff that you have to chew.

SECOND PERSON X213
He has yeah, little lumps in it.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah so you've got to, your mouth has to kind of organize it and swallow things kind of one at a time; you've got the thin stuff and the big stuff.

SECOND PERSON X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
So that actually can be kind of tricky.  A lot of times what they do is you know try to get people to separate their liquids and their solids.

PATIENT X213
Well I'm still going like this even when I'm drinking anything.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.  Okay.

PATIENT X213
It's very, very frustrating.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X213
I get kind of upset when I start coughing so bad.

DOCTOR X213
Have you ever tried using like thickening stuff and did that help at all?

PATIENT X213
No.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
It seems the thinner it is the better it is.

DOCTOR X213
Really okay.  So you cough more when you're drinking thickened liquids.

PATIENT X213
Seems like it.

DOCTOR X213
I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X213
Alright.

SECOND PERSON X213
@@@ these medications @@@.

PATIENT X213
When she gives that.

DOCTOR X213
Do you know which medications that need refills?

SECOND PERSON X213
Well this one's zero.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X213
And he said um @@@.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X213
That he called and wouldn't refill it.

DOCTOR X213
@@@.  Four refills so @@@.  And that was probably prescribed by the Neurology folks but let me, I'll go over the list with you when I get back.

SECOND PERSON X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  47:15  DOCTOR IN:  56:05)

DOCTOR X213
Alrighty.  I would like because it's been a while since you had your blood work done, I'd like to do a little bit of blood work to make sure, just check a few things to make sure we're not contributing to the falls that you're having.

PATIENT X213
Okay.

DOCTOR X213
And I would also like to check an EKG today.

PATIENT X213
Can you do that up here?

DOCTOR X213
Uh we'll see if he's here.  He wasn't here this morning but we'll try.

PATIENT X213
Okay.  It don't like me.

DOCTOR X213
No you're doing a good job.  @@@.  Now the third thing we'd like to do, I'm going to check like your vitamin D level which is something that's important for building you know strong bones.

PATIENT X213
It don't want you to do that.

SECOND PERSON X213
@@@.

DOCTOR X213
And um the other thing I'd like to do just because of all these falls that are happening, of course we want to avoid the falls as much as we can by um kind of like adapting to what's going on but I'd like to check a DEXA scan of your bones and make sure that you don't have osteoporosis or anything like that.  Some of these medications that you end up for long periods of time can have a negative effect on your bones and I want to make sure that if you fall your bones are as strong as they can be to avoid a fracture.

PATIENT X213
I haven't broke anything yet.

DOCTOR X213
I know but we don't want to @@@ that can be a devastating problem.

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
Once it happens so it's an easy test um, I'll put in the order for that and they can schedule it for you um.  You may need to call and schedule it actually but we'll see.  

SECOND PERSON X213
I should ask the dietician like stuff I should do cause I've fallen twice in the last month.

DOCTOR X213
Oh no.  Have you had a DEXA scan?

SECOND PERSON X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah we commonly get them for women but we don't really think of it for men.

SECOND PERSON X213
I @@@.

PATIENT X213
Just what I need more pills.

SECOND PERSON X213
I know.

DOCTOR X213
Vitamin D isn't that bad, if you need it you take it once a week.

SECOND PERSON X213
Those are those big green pills.

PATIENT X213
I thought they checked once for vitamin D.

DOCTOR X213
I can check and see when the last time was.  The last time you had labs here was a while ago.  They tried before but I guess they didn't get a good enough blood to report so.

PATIENT X213
@@@.

DOCTOR X213
We'll try again.  

PATIENT X213
When do you want my medication reviewed?

DOCTOR X213
Let's see what we've got for medications.

PATIENT X213
Um I need amlodipine.

DOCTOR X213
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X213
I have nothing left on that.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
Etodolac, I only got two left on that and that really really works.

SECOND PERSON X213
@@@.

PATIENT X213
The what?

SECOND PERSON X213
@@@.  It says there are four refills.

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X213
@@@.

DOCTOR X213
So you've got, you filled it in July, August, then did you stop taking it for a while or?

PATIENT X213
I don't have any.

DOCTOR X213
Uh when did you try to refill it?

PATIENT X213
Uh last week sometime.

DOCTOR X213
Okay what do you take that for?

PATIENT X213
I don't even know.

DOCTOR X213
It's like an allergy medication.  Were you?

PATIENT X213
Okay, probably for my nose.

DOCTOR X213
Allergy problems?

PATIENT X213
Well, @@@ I do but I don't know what I'm allergic to.  I'm allergic to coffee and uh or caffeine and penicillin, that's all I know of.

DOCTOR X213
But like seasonal allergies, stuffy nose, postnasal drip, stuff like that?

PATIENT X213
Stuffy nose all the time.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X213
Then I got one more.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.

PATIENT X213
@@@.  I think that's it.

DOCTOR X213
Alright, oh sorry did you need those to pick those up in the Pharmacy or did you want them mailed?

PATIENT X213
No I'll just get them mailed if they can.

DOCTOR X213
Okay.  Okay, alright.

PATIENT X213
It's easier that way.

DOCTOR X213
So I'd like you to get that EKG done, we'll see if they can do it for you up here.

PATIENT X213
Okay.

DOCTOR X213
But if not you may need to go down to the um Cardiology Lab down on the first floor.  So let me see if he's here, if not I'll give you directions.

PATIENT X213
Okay.

DOCTOR X213
Alright he's not here so we'll have you go downstairs.  Um so you'll go down, you know where the Lab is downstairs right?

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
Okay so we'll have you go there to get the blood tests done and then I'd like you to go to the, you can kind of, I think there are signs up that say like EKG testing.  It'll be on the first floor and you'll head towards four corners.

PATIENT X213
Okay.

DOCTOR X213
But uh before you get to four corners you'll turn left down what seems like kind of an empty hallway alright.

PATIENT X213
I've been there before.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah, it's between the elevators and @@@.

PATIENT X213
It's down to the basement floor.

DOCTOR X213
Oh did they send you down there?

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
For the EKG?

PATIENT X213
Yeah.

DOCTOR X213
Oh okay.  I've been told to send people it's on the first floor.

PATIENT X213
I'm going there, its close.

DOCTOR X213
You can ask yeah, ask around maybe they'll tell you I'm wrong but that's where I've been told to send people before.

PATIENT X213
So all the previous @@@ Building 228.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah so, yeah see what you can find out.  If they send you to the basement I apologize.  Alright and I'll let you know what I find out from the tests and what the results are of the DEXA scan.

PATIENT X213
Okay and we're all set then right?

DOCTOR X213
Yep.  

SECOND PERSON X213
And have they called them about the prescriptions.

DOCTOR X213
Uh yeah I mean I put the order in the computer so you can ask them up front if they can schedule for you, if not then @@@.

PATIENT X213
We just usually call.  We need to check the calendar at home.

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X213
We always do.

PATIENT X213
@@@.

DOCTOR X213
Take care, be safe okay.

PATIENT X213
Yeah, do we give this to the guy up there?

DOCTOR X213
Yeah.  We'll see you, take care.

PATIENT X213
We'll see what happens.

DOCTOR X213
Alright.

PATIENT X213
When do you want to see me again?

DOCTOR X213
Um it's in there, three months, three to four months.

PATIENT X213
Okay.  Okie doke.

PATIENT LEAVES:  67:50

Time is 11:25.

DOCTOR X44
160/90.

PATIENT X44
Well see that's what I told you.

DOCTOR X44
But it's gotta be 125/75.

PATIENT X44
@@@. It's because, but I told you why it's up.  I tell you why it was up.  @@@ getting fixed.  @@@  Hey you my doctor.

DOCTOR X44
I know, you need to tell me @@@.

PATIENT X44
I came here and stuff.

DOCTOR X44
Oh yeah @@@.

PATIENT X44
@@@ piss me off.  I just can't take it you know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X44
You are for sure taking all those medications?

PATIENT X44
Yeah.  I take out a chess board and all my medicines are sitting right there, @@@.  I got a morning ritual that I through, I got an evening ritual that I go through and I got one that I take at night before I go to bed.  That's the cholesterol right?

DOCTOR X44
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X44
Right.  That's the one I take, going on to bed.  But my back doc, ooh I have to take a deep breath before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X44
It hurts?

PATIENT X44
Yeah, that's how much it hurts.  I want to try some uh Social Security, see if I can retire, Social Security at 60.

DOCTOR X44
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X44
Well I got a lot of things going on with you doc okay.

DOCTOR X44
I know.

PATIENT X44
If I @@@, if I put that in, I wondered you know can we, can I get Social Security.

DOCTOR X44
@@@.  I'm not sure.

PATIENT X44
@@@.

DOCTOR X44
I don't know.  That's not something that I can help you with.  That's something that's between you and the government.

PATIENT X44
Well @@@.

DOCTOR X44
I don't think you've ever had back films here.  I don't know how that'll help you at all.

PATIENT X44
Well it'd show them that I do have problems with, because it was a permanent injury.

DOCTOR X44
@@@ because it got reversed they're likely not to give it to you anymore.

PATIENT X44
Well it's not reversed.  I took myself off of it.

DOCTOR X44
Right.  

PATIENT X44
They found @@@ something else was worse.

DOCTOR X44
Right.

PATIENT X44
So if that injury didn't go away all I got to do is see that that injury is still there.  If the injury is still there and I can show that it's still there, then that's the case.  @@@.

DOCTOR X44
Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?

PATIENT X44
I do.

DOCTOR X44
What is @@@.

PATIENT X44
I'm having problems using it.  I can't get a reading.

DOCTOR X44
So bring it in.

PATIENT X44
I've got it in the car; I keep forgetting to bring it in.

DOCTOR X44
When you come into the nurse bring it in.

PATIENT X44
I sure will.

DOCTOR X44
So you don't know what you're running at home.

PATIENT X44
No.  I'd like to cause that's why it's in the car cause I meant to bring it in for the lady to show me how to use it.  This is a new year and I need to get hold of these things.

DOCTOR X44
And the last thing I want to do is add more medication but your blood pressure is no good and we're gonna have to add more medication.

PATIENT X44
That's only because of the situation.

DOCTOR X44
It doesn't matter why.  The thing is we need to either you need to calm down or we need to give you more medication.

PATIENT X44
Let me calm down.

DOCTOR X44
You better try cause I mean you've got to calm down a lot you know.

PATIENT X44
I can calm down a lot.  Really I can.  Things is getting better.  You know God told me to pray about it and leave it in His hands and I prayed about it and I've left it in His hands but it's just that it takes some of us a little longer than others cause you know to have that type of faith.

DOCTOR X44
@@@.

PATIENT X44
Yeah cause I make sure.  Remember I tell you before she wasn't buying food around there for me to eat.  She didn't want to buy food because she didn't want me eating you know.  I told you she told me I needed to move out.  I wouldn't move out and the only way she's gonna get me out was to force me to do something where the law make me move out and she's been probing me and I won't take the bait.  We don't even sleep in the same bedroom.  I sleep in the bedroom downstairs.

DOCTOR X44
Alright.  I'll be back in a second.  You have everything squared away.  This is the one thing I'm concerned about.  I'm gonna do one of two things.  Either I'm gonna have you come back in four weeks and have it checked and if it's still high start you on another medication for this okay or it'll be better and I won't.  But I'm seriously doubting that it's gonna get better.

PATIENT X44
It's gonna be, now I don't doubt that it's gonna be better.  I'm gonna go see the old girlfriend.

DOCTOR X44
@@@ medications okay.  We've renewed.  Give us a call, you're gonna come back and see me in three months after you see the nurse in a week.

PATIENT X44
Okay.

DOCTOR X44
Okay.

PATIENT X44
Whoa, yeah I need tramadol to take.

DOCTOR X44
I ordered it, so tramadol you should get some in the mail in about a week.

PATIENT X44
Okay.

DOCTOR X44
You should have enough today.

PATIENT X44
Okay see but.

DOCTOR X44

PATIENT X44
Alright.  Don't, if I go down there and she tells me no we put it in the mail and that's all you getting what we put in the mail.

DOCTOR X44

PATIENT X44
No.

DOCTOR X44
That's not what I want; someone must have changed this, crap.

PATIENT X44
I can sound intimidating doc but I'm a kitten.  I am.  I'd rather back down than to have to do anything you know physical.  I turn my cheek seven times before I bite somebody and that the Bible.

DOCTOR X44
Alright.  Hang tight; we'll have you out of here in five minutes.  You need to go to the Lab today and get labs okay.

PATIENT X44
Alright, I can go get labs.

DOCTOR X44

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44
Perhaps we can do when you come for that blood pressure visit.

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44

DOCTOR X44

DOCTOR X44

PATIENT X44

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:15  DOCTOR IN:  43:18)

DOCTOR X44
Okay.  You say you're taking all those medications, the hydrochlorothiazide, the amlodipine, how come you haven't refilled any of these?  Cause a lot of these things you haven't filled in a really long time.  But the amlodipine you filled in September.  

PATIENT X44
Which one is the amlodipine?

DOCTOR X44
Okay, @@@ if you were taking that every day, September, October, you should have been out in November and then the hydrochlorothiazide, again, that's 120 pills for 60 days.  You should have run out of all this stuff in November.

PATIENT X44
Okay.  There's at least four pills.

DOCTOR X44
I'm not gonna add another blood pressure pill.

PATIENT X44
Thank you.

DOCTOR X44
But I want you to pick up all of this crap up today.  I want you to pick up all these pills today.

PATIENT X44
What you mean all these, what pills?

DOCTOR X44
The blood pressure pills.  So that we know that you have them and that you're taking them.

PATIENT X44
This is the am, what is it the am.

DOCTOR X44
Amlodipine.

PATIENT X44
Amlodipine okay.

DOCTOR X44

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44
The hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril okay.

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44
Those two I'm gonna ask you to pick up today.

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44
And you're gonna take the Levaquin like you're supposed to for two weeks and you're gonna see the nurse to see what your blood pressure is then.

PATIENT X44

DOCTOR X44
In the meantime you're gonna get films of your back and I'm gonna get an ultrasound of your kidneys.

PATIENT X44
Okay.  Okay, you okay?

DOCTOR X44
Okay.  So let me make a few changes.  This you get x-rays and the ultrasound and we'll try to get it done sometimes next week.

PATIENT X44
@@@.

DOCTOR X44
Okay.

PATIENT X44
All this is gonna get better.  I got a, I got a task master in this new girlfriend and if I'm gonna leave the house, that's where I'm going, she gonna want to know all of this.  She said I'm not gonna die on her.  My right now, she don't care.  Uh I got to go where I'm loved doc.  I do.  But the thing is doc.

DOCTOR X44
Yeah.

PATIENT X44
I be leaving, I'm not working, I'm going to go leave that where I've been 19 years and go someplace else and I'm still not working but I'm going to take up with a new lady.  I was trying to climb my way out of it through the Bible but the Bible say I can't do it.  It's a sin for me to lust after this girl because she's not my wife and the only way I can do away with my wife is to give her a divorce and I can only give her a divorce if she's unfaithful.  

DOCTOR X44
Okay.

PATIENT X44
I don't know if she's unfaithful or not.  I can, I can give false witness and just say she is but then that wouldn't be good for me.  I could be just lying.  I'd have to actually know if she's you know unfaithful in order to give her specifically a divorce, that what the Bible said.  That's the only way I can get away from her is through adultery.  But that should be on both sides shouldn't it?

DOCTOR X44
It should.  I don't begin to understand Christianity but.

PATIENT X44
And you are?

DOCTOR X44
Hindu.

PATIENT X44
Hindu?

DOCTOR X44
Yeah.

PATIENT X44
Hmm.  

DOCTOR X44
But religion is religion right?

PATIENT X44
Yeah, right.  We all believe that there's a supreme being.

DOCTOR X44
Exactly.

PATIENT X44
Hindu, isn't that an @@@?

DOCTOR X44
No.  That's @@@.

PATIENT X44
Oh voodoo.

DOCTOR X44
Yes.

PATIENT X44
Hindu @@@  I have to investigate, you know go more into it, @@@.  But we all believe in a supreme being and that @@@ end.

DOCTOR X44
Okay.

PATIENT X44
And we are all @@@ in the end.

DOCTOR X44
Yes.

PATIENT X44
So we're together on that.  Oh.  @@@  I can give her a certificate of divorce is she's unfaithful so I'm feeling like if I sin; if she's unfaithful then I can get a divorce.  If I'm unfaithful she can get a divorce.  @@@ 2010 doc.  You know what I found out though in looking, I've always been um uh a late starter.  I started kindergarten a whole year.

DOCTOR X44
Late.

PATIENT X44
Late right so I've always things, things have always been late to me so this just might be @@@.  I look at horoscopes and I don't really go along with it, but I will read it and it says that the universe is trying to tell me something.  And I look because I hadn't seen her in 30 years and I find, she find me, her daughter find me on Facebook.  Her daughter was 7 years old when we were together and she's 36 now.  She says she's in love with me and please come over.  Cause you know when we were going together all that time, she got raped.

DOCTOR X44
Really.  Who got raped?

PATIENT X44
The girl that I'm talking about.

DOCTOR X44
Oh really.

PATIENT X44
Three guys raped her.  She was out at a disco one night and three guys raped her but she showed up over my house the next day and I think I'd do what any man with kids do, I gave her my bedroom, my bed and I took care of her until she was up and well and she was mental enough to get up and get around I took her shopping and spent about $500 on her for new clothes and took all those old clothes she had and burned them and her and her daughter lived with me for a while until she got on her feet and I felt that any righteous man was supposed to do that.

DOCTOR X44
Good for you.

PATIENT X44
It was a mother and a daughter and needed help.

DOCTOR X44
Alright buddy.

PATIENT X44
Alright doc.

DOCTOR X44
Okay.

PATIENT X44
Yeah until I get downstairs.

DOCTOR X44
Yeah.

PATIENT X44
Oh I got to @@.

DOCTOR X44
Yeah.

PATIENT X44
4 o'clock?

DOCTOR X44
You can get all the labs while you're here but @@@.  Okay.  Now get the labs, then go pick up the meds, they should be ready for you.

PATIENT X44
I'll check in on the meds then go to the other things.

DOCTOR X44
You want them to do them right here?

PATIENT X44
Here, @@@.  yeah I do that.

DOCTOR X44
Yeah.  We need urine from you.  You gonna do all that up here?

PATIENT X44
Uh it depends.  What type of urine.

DOCTOR X44
It might be better if you go downstairs.  You see I ordered a bunch of stuff downstairs.

PATIENT X44
Oh okay, let me go downstairs.

DOCTOR X44
Go downstairs.

PATIENT X44
Cause I got to make a stop and travel.  Oh the last time I went to travel uh they did have, they ran out of money.  Alright doc.

DOCTOR X44
See you later PATIENT.

PATIENT X44
Yes sir.

Patient leaves 52:14.

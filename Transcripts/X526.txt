PATIENT X526
Well I had to see them yesterday so I'm waiting to see what's going on.

DOCTOR X526
What thing was that?

PATIENT X526
The defibrillation.  What is this appointment for?

DOCTOR X526
I think we were just going to follow up.  You haven't seen me since, you were here you saw DOCTOR in May.  Let me see.  You were having some trouble with your breathing.

PATIENT X526
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X526

PATIENT X526
Same old thing worsen.

DOCTOR X526
What's happening, what's going on?

PATIENT X526
Now I was taking four or five medicines for the uh the irregular heartbeat05.  They put me on four or five different medicines, one of them is metoprolol.  I think that's the one that makes your mouth dry and you @@@ breathe but then there was a small cough and so he wanted me to talk to somebody in Pulmonary.  But we changing that until you get to finish with that.  The breathing was @@@ and then when I cough, rales but I couldn't cough it up because whatever it is @@@.

DOCTOR X526
Are you not coughing or you're not able to bring it up is that what you're saying?

PATIENT X526
I'm not able to bring it up.  You know some rattling.

DOCTOR X526
And what did we give you for that?

PATIENT X526
Nothing.

DOCTOR X526
Nothing at all.  We didn't give you any, we gave you some antibiotics.

PATIENT X526
The antibiotic wasn't for.

DOCTOR X526
What was that for?

PATIENT X526
That was for helping my blood.

DOCTOR X526
Has that stopped?

PATIENT X526
Yeah it stopped.  What happened to the last doctor I seen?

DOCTOR X526

PATIENT X526
The female doctor who described the antibiotics.

DOCTOR X526

PATIENT X526
Okay.

DOCTOR X526
Uh we work together.  She's my supervising doctor.

PATIENT X526
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X526
Um so the cough has gotten better or is it just the blood has gotten better?

PATIENT X526
No the cough much better.  The blood in the sputum is cleared up.

DOCTOR X526
Okay.

PATIENT X526
Cause she.

DOCTOR X526
So now it's just the rattling in there.

PATIENT X526
The rattle is here and I can't bring it up when I need to. 

DOCTOR X526
Are you taking the cough syrup?  Is that breaking it up at all?

PATIENT X526
Not really.

DOCTOR X526
Okay.  Are you getting short of breath?

PATIENT X526
Hmm.

DOCTOR X526
Is it better or worse than it was three weeks ago?

PATIENT X526
Bout the same.

DOCTOR X526
And did you ever get a chest x-ray?

PATIENT X526
Yeah I got the chest x-ray the same day she prescribed the antibiotics.

DOCTOR X526
Good.  Uh okay.  It shows there wasn't much change but they wanted to treat you cause you're having all these @@@ symptoms so how did the thing go yesterday?

PATIENT X526
Okay I guess.  They get it back in rhythm.

DOCTOR X526
Good.

PATIENT X526
So we have to wait and find out what the next step, cause that's the second time that this happened.

DOCTOR X526
Right, right.  Um are you still smoking?  You quit a while back right?

PATIENT X526
Yeah.

DOCTOR X526
Okay. Alright, any other problems, concerns?

PATIENT X526
No I'm guessing that I should see the cardiologist.  I was wondering if @@@.

DOCTOR X526
Yeah.

PATIENT X526
It's keeping me tired and it's like I'm sleepy but @@@ so I got to probably wait and see what's gonna happen with that.

DOCTOR X526
And you think it's the metoprolol?

PATIENT X526
I think, I wasn't @@@ until he put me on the metoprolol.

DOCTOR X526
How long ago was that?  @@@.

PATIENT X526
January.

DOCTOR X526
Okay.  So since then you've had a lot of, you've been sleepy.

PATIENT X526
And the shortness of breath.  Especially one of them, @@@.

DOCTOR X526
Okay, okay.  

PATIENT X526
I'm trying to find, I have been trying to get something for my ankles cause my feet are swelling up real big.

DOCTOR X526
Do you take a water pill?

PATIENT X526
I was taking the water pill and then they finally start going down but I was just taking some.

DOCTOR X526
Does it hurt?  Is it painful?

PATIENT X526
No I was taking some borrowed water pills which you're not supposed to do.  Cause I wasn't getting nothing for my.

DOCTOR X526
You need to get you your own, you don't have to borrow them.

PATIENT X526
Well I have been telling these people for the last month about how big my ankle swelling, my feet were swelling up and then @@@.  Now I had 12 pills but none of them was a derivative so.  

DOCTOR X526
Well hopefully now that your heart's in a good rhythm, that'll help too.  We can get you a little bit of a water pill.  Have a seat here.  When are you supposed to see the cardiologist then?

PATIENT X526
Next week.

DOCTOR X526
Yeah it's not on there.

PATIENT X526
I don't think so.

DOCTOR X526
We'll get you back in the clinic in a couple of weeks.  Let me see what their last note said.  Can you lean forward so I can listen to you?  Deep breath in and out.  Okay.  Just breathe normal.  Are you using your inhalers?

PATIENT X526
Yeah.

DOCTOR X526
And what about the Coumadin, was there a question about the Coumadin?

PATIENT X526
Yeah I talked to the person in the Pharmacy and they said now you have to keep taking it until you see the cardiologist.

DOCTOR X526
Right.

PATIENT X526
But I have no appointment to see the cardiologist until a week.

DOCTOR X526
Yeah we'll see what.

PATIENT X526
And I supposed to I guess, uh she @@@ I don't know @@@ or not.

DOCTOR X526
Okay.  Do you want these mailed to you or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT X526
What?

DOCTOR X526
The water pill.

PATIENT X526
You can mail them to me.

DOCTOR X526
Alright.  Okay.  Let me talk to DOCTOR and we'll if we can probably get you, uh you can probably start decreasing that metoprolol, that's causing some of the problems.  How much are you taking, do you know?  Do you remember?

PATIENT X526
About half a pill three times a day.

DOCTOR X526
Okay.  We may be able to just take you completely off that to see how you do and we'll get you in to see the cardiologist to see her within the month okay.

PATIENT X526
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X526
I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:24  DOCTOR IN:  70:19)

DOCTOR X526
Alright here, so we'll get you an appointment in to see your cardiologist and um there's that.

PATIENT X526
Okay.

DOCTOR X526
We can have you stop both the metoprolol and the Coumadin now that the shock went well and now the rhythm's normal.  If it gets abnormal again, if you're having any symptoms uh having the chest palpitations, having the severe shortness of breath you should come in to the Emergency Department okay.  @@@.  

PATIENT X526
Okay so since they got my heart back in rhythm.

DOCTOR X526
Yeah.

PATIENT X526
So that's the end of the pacemaker right?

DOCTOR X526
Um you don't have a pacemaker.

PATIENT X526
I know.

DOCTOR X526
Okay.

PATIENT X526
That was talking about putting one in.

DOCTOR X526
We'll see.  If you stay in this rhythm yeah it's @@@ think you don't need it.  Uh I think they're also concerned about, yeah I think that's the issue is that they can't, if you're heart's in normal rhythm you don't get a pacer.  If it's beating fast and they can't stop it then you need to have not an operation but where they burn the place that's been getting a little fast and they put in a pacemaker so you don't need that.

PATIENT X526
They burned it, I thought they just took a little old @@@.

DOCTOR X526
They do that but what they have to do is that uh what's happening is there's a lot of respiratory @@@ making the heart beat fast.

PATIENT X526
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X526
So they got to buzz that place where that's causing all the problems.  If they do that then the heart will slow down really slow and you need a pacemaker.

PATIENT X526
Oh okay.  @@@.  Okay.

DOCTOR X526
So if it happens again I don't know we'll have to talk about that again.

PATIENT X526
Alright.

DOCTOR X526
But we'll get a repeat ultrasound of the heart.

PATIENT X526
Okay.

DOCTOR X526
Alright you take care.

PATIENT LEAVES:  73:08.

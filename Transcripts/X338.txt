DOCTOR X338
Okay.  The last time we did a stress test for you was in 2008 and you got really short of breath and they had to stop it.  Do you ever remember having an echo done at the VA?  An echocardiogram, it's like an ultrasound of your heart.  I don't see one in the file here.

PATIENT X338
No I didn't have one here.

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
Did they go in through the groin and put in a stent?

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  Where was that done at?

PATIENT X338
Uh at xxx.  I got medical records.

DOCTOR X338
Maybe you could fax those over to me so I could take a look at them.

PATIENT X338
Okay, I'm gonna see do I have, I might have took them out.

DOCTOR X338
@@@.  Were you having chest pain at that time?

PATIENT X338
Uh yes, shortness, I was really short of breath and um I was rushed to the hospital.  No I don't have them at all.

DOCTOR X338
How many stents did they place in your heart?

PATIENT X338
I think.

DOCTOR X338
Just one or?

PATIENT X338
I think it was one.  See this is the third time they done did something to my heart.

DOCTOR X338
Hmm.  But you had a heart surgery.

PATIENT X338
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
Back in 2001.

PATIENT X338
Right.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  But since then nothing's happened.

PATIENT X338
No, 2001 I had the heart surgery.

DOCTOR X338
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X338
@@@.

DOCTOR X338
@@@ last year.

PATIENT X338
Right.

DOCTOR X338
So was it last March or this March like a month ago?

PATIENT X338
No it was this March.

DOCTOR X338
Oh this March again.  You had one stent placed in March in 2011 too.

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
Yeah.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah, so now there's two in there.

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
So March is tough one for you.  

PATIENT X338
What can I say?

DOCTOR X338
So since they put the stent in, is anything gotten better or worse or is it the same?

PATIENT X338
Uh I mean, I don't know.  I don't complain.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.

PATIENT X338
Same to me.  I mean you know every now and then you feel like uh, discomfort in this area but nothing to cry about.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  If it gets bad though, you need to talk to somebody or go to the ED okay.  Cause you do have a lot of cardiac disease that we worry about it.

PATIENT X338
Right.

DOCTOR X338
You know.  Okay, yeah definitely fax me those records okay.  I'll tell them to provide you the fax number.  Um and then when was the last time we checked your cholesterol?  Let's take a look.

PATIENT X338
I had some blood work down, what was it?

DOCTOR X338
In February.

PATIENT X338
Uh yes uh, the doctor had me do it.

DOCTOR X338
They checked everything but the cholesterol.

PATIENT X338
That wasn't nice.

DOCTOR X338
So I had checked your cholesterol, let's see that was in August when I saw you and your um LDL was a little bit high.  It was 123, it's your bad cholesterol is high.  We have you on um a statin; let me see if we changed anything since that time.

PATIENT X338
It should be down with the good diet I'm using.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah and you, you're doing really well with your MOVE Program.  Are you taking that pill every single day, that statin?

PATIENT X338
I forget it sometimes but I take it.

DOCTOR X338
You forget sometimes.  Try to take it as much as you can and take it every day before you go to bed.  Put it by your nightstand and take it every night because if you keep forgetting to take it your cholesterol can go up and then that's what can give you more heart attacks.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
You know that one's really, really important.  That one and the Plavix are your two most important medications okay.  Alright so we'll recheck, we'll recheck your cholesterol um.  When are you coming back?  Are you going to be back to us any time soon?

PATIENT X338
Uh yes, I'm gonna be back uh.

DOCTOR X338
You're here.

PATIENT X338
The 24th.

DOCTOR X338
4th, okay.  Can I order a fasting lipid profile for then?

PATIENT X338
Sure I can do it.

DOCTOR X338
Can you not eat in the morning and get your lab drawn?

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  Oh I see, they didn't collect it last time, your cholesterol because maybe you weren't fasting.  Make sure you don't eat anything for 12 hours before you have the blood draw.

PATIENT X338
I didn't eat nothing that day.

DOCTOR X338
Hmm, that's weird cause it was ordered.  I wonder why.  And then let's see, your sugars, let's take a look at that.  Your liver enzymes look good; your kidneys are working really well.  And we checked your hemoglobin A1c which is like your sugars to see how your sugars are well controlled.

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
And it was still good then but I'd like to check it again.  I'm gonna check it on the 24th when you get your labs done okay.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
And do you know when we last checked your prostate?  Let's take a look at that.  Okay we'll check your prostate level too.  Still have smoking?

PATIENT X338
No.

DOCTOR X338
Good for you.  Okay.  And how's your blood pressure been doing?

PATIENT X338
Uh, I been checking it.  Okay I was hoping that she did this morning, when I just came.

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
Okay but I did mine before I came.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
Mine was 112/66, I had that.

DOCTOR X338
That's really good.

PATIENT X338
Okay then that was this morning but yesterday was 140/78.

DOCTOR X338
That's a little high.

PATIENT X338
Well I got, you know, things going on at home.  I have my mother-in-law who has dementia.

DOCTOR X338
Oh.

PATIENT X338

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
This morning but I, but like I said I get in the car, sit in there, try to calm myself down.

DOCTOR X338
You bet, as long as long as you kind of have a way to.

PATIENT X338
Right.

DOCTOR X338
Take all this.

PATIENT X338
But that's what we got going on right now.

DOCTOR X338
So you've got stuff going on.

PATIENT X338
Right and it's like I'm the oldest one and they all.

DOCTOR X338
It all falls on you, yeah it's hard.

PATIENT X338
But I was wondering about that number, the numbers I gave you, you said the one this morning.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
Was okay?

DOCTOR X338
Yeah so your goal for your blood pressure is to stay below 140 the high number.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
High number and then below 90 on the bottom.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
Bottom number.  

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
If you're anywhere below the 130s, I'm really happy.  We don't want you dropping into the low like 90s or anything like that.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
But your goal is to stay around like 120s I'm really happy with, 110s I'm really happy with for the systolic blood pressure.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
The top number.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
That's really what we're focused on.  That prevents your risk of stroke.

PATIENT X338
That top number is.

DOCTOR X338
The top number you want it below 140 okay.

PATIENT X338
Cause I had, you know, even though it's not that active but I do things like when you go to Walgreens and all.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
I always stick my arm in there.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah, yeah.  What do you usually get?

PATIENT X338
Uh on the borderline.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
That's when I say you know I try to calm myself down but then all this in the family and.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
It goes up and down.

DOCTOR X338
If you're consistently getting high blood pressures, like above the 140.

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
We can put you on some medications a little bit.

PATIENT X338
Right.  But it was like border, like I say, it's been dropping and when I seen that 112.

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
Okay good.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
I got the machine at home also.

DOCTOR X338
If you want you can bring it in next time and they can compare our machine to your machine and make sure it's accurate.

PATIENT X338
Hmm.

DOCTOR X338
Just to kind of know.  Okay and let's see.  What medications you need refilled.  You have that, you have that.  You have Plavix.  The only refill was your blood pressure medication is the only thing that was running out.  Anything else going on?

PATIENT X338
Uh, no.  Uh I want to know uh could you make appointments for me for the dentist to get some of these broken tooth out of my mouth?

DOCTOR X338
What's been happening with your teeth?  @@@.

PATIENT X338
Well believe it or not, even though when I got out I spent money on dentures; most of the ones that's broken off is the ones I got repaired in the service.

DOCTOR X338
Oh no.

PATIENT X338
Oh back then they used to put lead in your teeth to fill.

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
You didn't know that?

DOCTOR X338

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
That didn't work and all of that but I got the pieces in my mouth and I want to get them just pulled out and cleaned out so I can go buy me some uh plates.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah where are your broken teeth?

PATIENT X338
Uh up here, over here.

DOCTOR X338
Does it make it that hard for you to eat?

PATIENT X338
Oh I'll survive.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.

PATIENT X338
I know how to work it around.  Yeah I can go get me a plate and I know the VA don't take care of that, that's alright.  They do enough for me.

DOCTOR X338
We'll see.  They are very picky on who they will actually see in Dental.

PATIENT X338
Right I know.

DOCTOR X338
I'll put the order in and let's see what we can do.

PATIENT X338
Okay.  That's all we can do.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah.  Alright and your last colonoscopy was in 2008.

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X338
Um have you ever had the shingles vaccine?

PATIENT X338
What's that?

DOCTOR X338
You've heard of that.  So did you have chicken pox as a kid?

PATIENT X338
Yes.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  If you had chicken pox as a kid that virus you know stays in your system and when you get older, like above the age of 60, your immune system it starts to kind of go down.

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
And then um it can flare-up and it causes like a very painful rash.  It can cause like neuropathy and stuff.  Usually we just vaccinate so it doesn't kind of kick back in in your later years.

PATIENT X338
Don't matter, if I need to get it tell me.

DOCTOR X338
Alright let's do it.  Okay.  Have you ever had a handicapped sticker before?

PATIENT X338
No.

DOCTOR X338
This is a new application.

PATIENT X338
No.  This is new.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  They have very strict requirements on who I'm allowed to give that out to so what are your symptoms that you need handicapped parking versus regular parking?

PATIENT X338
Uh, just short of breath, distance.

DOCTOR X338
Short of breath.

PATIENT X338
Uh my leg hurts and uh.

DOCTOR X338

You have a cane okay.  We can document that.  Is your pain pretty well controlled in that leg?

PATIENT X338
Well, with me favoring it, both legs hurt.  This leg, the right leg is where the problem's at.

DOCTOR X338
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X338
It's the weak leg.

DOCTOR X338
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X338
And I'm putting all of the strain on this one.

DOCTOR X338
Now the other one hurts then.

PATIENT X338
And I got them all; I kept everything they gave me.

DOCTOR X338
Let's take a look at that.  Where are the notes for the therapy?

PATIENT X338
@@@.

DOCTOR X338
Oh here, this is it.

PATIENT X338
Oh.

DOCTOR X338

DOCTOR X338
Let me uh ask my attending which one I'm supposed so.  So I'm not in Indiana, I'm wondering if they want me to say I'm part of the VA and let me review this.  So let me just talk to her.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
Um but this part you fill out, it's just like your license plate number and your social security, all this stuff.

PATIENT X338
Oh yeah this is my part.

DOCTOR X338
Yeah, yeah.  And were you a smoker in the past?

PATIENT X338
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
No.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  Next year we'll have to do a ultrasound of your abdomen.  When's your birthday, in May?

PATIENT X338
May 22nd.

DOCTOR X338
Maybe we can order it um, if you don't mind we'll just order it now and it's just a screen to make sure you don't have an aneurysm in your aorta.  People that have smoked in the past are at higher risk for an aneurysm and they can rupture and you can bleed internally.

PATIENT X338
No problem.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  I'm going to go ahead and order it.  @@@.

PATIENT X338
You the doctor.

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
Okay thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  66:40  DOCTOR IN:  72:20)

DOCTOR X338
Alright sir, you're all set.  So we'll do the labs when you come back for the MOVE Program.  I'm also going to put in um uh a consult cause you know the last time we checked your sugars they were like creeping up and they were almost at the level of diabetes and we don't want that to happen.  So I'm just gonna send you to our nutritionist that'll give you just some pre-diabetic stuff to avoid, so we don't ever get to that point.

PATIENT X338
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X338
Okay.  And that's it and then I'll have you follow up with me.  We could do another six months if you prefer we could do I don't know, what do you like, how often do you like to come in?

PATIENT X338
Well it could be every three, four months, I don't care.

DOCTOR X338
Okay we'll do that.  We could do four months.  And really try to take your lipid medication, the simvastatin.

PATIENT X338
Okay.

DOCTOR X338
And even if you can't remember it at night take it in the morning, you could take it every morning if it doesn't work at night.

PATIENT X338
That'd probably be the best time.

DOCTOR X338
Then do that, that's fine.  We really want to make sure you get it okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X338
Okay what about that other form I gave you?

DOCTOR X338
Oh yeah, you know what let me just ask her, I pulled it up, one second.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  73:30  DOCTOR IN:  76:37)

DOCTOR X338
Alright sir, all done.  I have the form filled out for you here.

PATIENT X338
Thank you.

DOCTOR X338
Uh-huh.  And then I'll send you here to get your shingles vaccine and then they'll help you check out okay.

PATIENT X338
Okay um.

DOCTOR X338
I'll see you again in four months.

PATIENT X338
Okay, uh you said you wanted that blood test.  Do you want it done today or what?

DOCTOR X338

PATIENT X338
Cause I haven't eaten today at all.

DOCTOR X338
Oh okay, well you can unless you want to come back, whatever you want to do.

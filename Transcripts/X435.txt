PATIENT X435
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X435
How long were in you xxx xxx?

PATIENT X435
A week.

DOCTOR X435
A week.

PATIENT X435
We got here on Monday.

DOCTOR X435
Feeling better so far?

PATIENT X435
No really.  Slowly @@@ tired.

DOCTOR X435
@@@.  

PATIENT X435
I got to lose some weight.  I have to lose weight @@@ before I.

DOCTOR X435
We have a program here.

PATIENT X435
I got to be 195 @@@.

DOCTOR X435
And I think that's probably why you're getting back pain.  @@@ the joints in your back and your knees and muscles you put a lot of strain on them with the weight.  There's a program to help you.  It's called the MOVE Program, you heard of it?

PATIENT X435
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X435
It's basically to help you with nutrition, helps you with exercise.  We have a gym here and we have some like recreation stuff you can use.

PATIENT X435
@@@.

DOCTOR X435
How'd get rid of that?

PATIENT X435
@@@ get paid for something.

DOCTOR X435
Okay.  Um it should right, if they arrange for that or not but I think it'd be a good thing for you.  You know this weight is only going to make the heart failure worse too so.  It's gonna be difficult to keep that blood pressure under control and when the blood pressure gets out of control then the heart has more strain.  I think dealing with the weight is gonna be just as important as dealing with all these other little personal things you deal with.

PATIENT X435
Yeah.

DOCTOR X435
So you have an appointment with the pharmacist today um.

PATIENT X435
Well I'll be meeting @@@.

DOCTOR X435
And it says here you have it from 1-2 o'clock.  This afternoon I'll have you go to the Pharmacy and pick up your Lasix and your simvastatin okay and we'll have you pick up some more of the Losartan for your high blood pressure.  Do you have a heating pack at home for that back?

PATIENT X435
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X435
No.  See it works really well for those types of muscle things.  Um I don't want to give you any ibuprofen.

PATIENT X435
I generally take Aleve.

DOCTOR X435
Yeah.  Uh you've some Tylenol @@@ that you can try.

PATIENT X435
And can you get that for me?  I got upset when I couldn't button these pants.  @@@.

DOCTOR X435
Why do you think you gained weight?

PATIENT X435
Cause usually I don't do much.  I got to start walking soon.  So any it's getting hard to fluctuate @@@ move.  I @@@ lay in the bed.

DOCTOR X435
Uh-huh.  Well I'm going to okay it on here.  I think you should have this.

PATIENT X435
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X435
@@@ too much fluid.  Have you had your @@@ at night, to be able to breathe?

PATIENT X435

PATIENT X435

DOCTOR X435
Okay um.  Let me talks to DOCTOR about getting you transportation to the MOVE Program.  We'll get your prescriptions and uh and then you know I would try a heat pack at night.  At Walgreens they have ones that you can plug in.  They have ones that you put in the microwave.  They've got a whole bunch of different kinds that you can try on that area.  Where is it again?

PATIENT X435
Right here.

DOCTOR X435
What I would do is if you can, when you're lying in bed either every morning or if you're sitting in the chair later in the evening, throw a heat pack onto there.

PATIENT X435
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X435
Okay.  Um and the heat will help kind of penetrate the muscle.

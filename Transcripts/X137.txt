DOCTOR X137
PATIENT?

PATIENT X137
Yes.

DOCTOR X137
How you doing?

PATIENT X137
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X137
@@@.

PATIENT X137
Yep @@@.

DOCTOR X137
What's new?

PATIENT X137
Nothing much.

DOCTOR X137
You have to remember I use the best uh recording in all my patients they love it.

PATIENT X137
Oh.

DOCTOR X137
You had more records than I did.  I love it; you're kind of uh, oh look at this.

PATIENT X137
They're the same as uh blood pressure @@@.

DOCTOR X137
That's great.  @@@ oh well, they looked at it.  128, 114 over 71, 113, 115.  Well your blood pressures are doing, pretty much are goal is less than 130.

PATIENT X137
Well the last times have had a couple of spikes.

DOCTOR X137
Uh, yeah what happens with blood pressure is that throughout the day.

PATIENT X137
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X137
It's kind of more like this than anything else so, what's really important for us is to sort of a trend for these

PATIENT X137
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X137
So I'm uh happy with your blood pressure.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
And so let's just say I checked it today and I saw a 135/80 randomly today um.  If you didn't have this log, I'd have to say ah man I wonder what.

PATIENT X137
Well, I think today it was.

DOCTOR X137
Right, yeah, so with this log I know that you know as the day changes with different levels of stress.

PATIENT X137
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X137
And different levels of caffeine or you know how excited you are, your blood pressure kind of goes like this but what matters, over the long haul, is sort of the trend.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
And your trend is go.  Same with your sugars.  Um now you're taking, let's pull up your.

PATIENT X137
Yeah I have to work on the medication because we just have a part of them filled.  You were going to look at it last time and.

DOCTOR X137
@@@ filled, oh in terms of which ones were @@@.

PATIENT X137
Yeah you were going to make a decision as to what I should take and obviously may not have had a chance to do that.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.  Well, you mean um in terms of what we could get you or maybe?

PATIENT X137
Yeah, yeah.  Cause I was on more medication before I come here and you said we could.

DOCTOR X137
What were you on when you came here?  I have here that you were on glyburide, you're taking 5 mg daily.

PATIENT X137
Correct.

DOCTOR X137
Right now.  Yeah your hemoglobin A1c last time was incredible.

PATIENT X137
How can I get copies of the reports?  Cause I'd like.

DOCTOR X137
That's why I can print one.

PATIENT X137
Alright can I and what I got tested for.  Cause you had mentioned once maybe.

DOCTOR X137
And did you get a stress test?

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
I wonder why I didn't see the results of that.

PATIENT X137
I was supposed to, you said you might give me an HIV and uh, I forgot what the other one was and I had no idea what tests I really had.

DOCTOR X137
In May.  Good, no evidence of ischemia, so that's good.  I'm trying to remember why we.  Were you having any complaints?

PATIENT X137
Well I had an upper chest infection or something.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.

PATIENT X137
And some tenderness of the chest.  @@@ medications I was on.

DOCTOR X137
Oh, historically.

PATIENT X137
Yeah.  You changed the.

DOCTOR X137
Glyburide, no yeah you were only on one medication for diabetes.

PATIENT X137
Right, right.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah but.

PATIENT X137
But I was on Flomax and finasteride.

DOCTOR X137
Oh.

PATIENT X137
And then I was also on this for high blood pressure and you said you were going to review that and uh see.

DOCTOR X137
Okay, which ones are you taking, the lisinopril one?

PATIENT X137
Well you changed yeah, no uh metoprolol.  You changed that.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.

PATIENT X137
The last visit.

DOCTOR X137
Let me see what I've got again diabetes.

PATIENT X137
You did have a half and a half.

DOCTOR X137
Let's see what I put here um.  Switched from metoprolol to lisinopril @@@.  I think we just thought your regimen was kind of bizarre.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
And the reason why we changed that was because typically if people have any sort of, if they have diabetes or if they have any sort of heart problems, uh metoprolol is sort of a really good drug for cardio protection.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
But I think it's kind of a weird choice and the last time you a bad reaction to metoprolol.  So the reason why we changed it wasn't because of uh.

PATIENT X137
Right cause the other one I was on, does that mean I don't need to take that any longer?

DOCTOR X137
The verapamil?

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah no.  Uh, we had stopped your, uh wait a minute.  We had stopped your.  You were historically on diltiazem.  Both of those were sort of calcium channel blockers um, so I think at this point you're taking, you're on lisinopril, verapamil @@@.

PATIENT X137
@@@ that I asked the doctor if he couldn't get something more in the line of @@@.

DOCTOR X137
You have verapamil but weren't you on diltiazem?

PATIENT X137
No.

DOCTOR X137
What I have on the list @@@ diltiazem.

PATIENT X137
No.

DOCTOR X137
No.

PATIENT X137
@@@ and this one.

DOCTOR X137
Well I don't know why I have your, instead of diltiazem.

PATIENT X137
Well I don't know.

DOCTOR X137
No.  Maybe.

PATIENT X137
Unless it was under a different name but I don't recognize that.

DOCTOR X137
Okay, so you're no longer taking that though.

PATIENT X137
No.

DOCTOR X137
Okay good.  Yeah I looked at it.

PATIENT X137
Instead am I taking.

DOCTOR X137
Based upon your.

PATIENT X137
Or am I taking this cause I ran out of that uh.

DOCTOR X137
The lisinopril?

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah we'll continue the lisinopril.

PATIENT X137
Alright.

DOCTOR X137
10 mg daily.  It's good for your heart.

PATIENT X137
@@@.  Get off of this.

DOCTOR X137
No.

PATIENT X137
Just a prescription.

DOCTOR X137
Oh for a prescription okay.

PATIENT X137
Cause I @@@.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.

PATIENT X137
And then there's a couple that are 30 day ones.

DOCTOR X137
Let's renew, expires, expires, all of these expire in 2011.  Let me see here.

PATIENT X137
Well I've got two that are 30 days and that's a pain in the butt.

DOCTOR X137
Let's do this, let's do um, I think what you need and let's do 120.  You mean it's a pain in the butt because you.

PATIENT X137
Well every 30 days uh you know.

DOCTOR X137
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X137
I get it cause it takes a week and a half to get so by the time I get it I won't have to reorder.

DOCTOR X137
I'll change the dose; I mean I'll change the quantity.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
Let's see @@@.

PATIENT X137
And then yeah and then there are two of them that are 30 day supplies.

DOCTOR X137
The statin one?

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
The statin one you have plenty of those.  Let's see about the glyburide, we can renew them.

PATIENT X137
Glyburide is a 30 day supply that would be good to @@@.

DOCTOR X137
And let me put in for the lisinopril.  You're taking 10 right?  Lisinopril here we go 10 @@@.  We'll give you @@@.  Do you want them mailed to you or do you want to pick them up at the window?

PATIENT X137
Well if I could pick this one up at the window then I can go on the website.

DOCTOR X137
Website.

PATIENT X137
The website yeah.

DOCTOR X137
That's kind of convenient huh.

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
Okay so that's the medications, let me go back to this list right here make sure I.  Get some labs for you today, hemoglobin A1c what it was, let's see let's look at.  You've had two stress tests?

PATIENT X137

DOCTOR X137
I mean in addition to the one here.

PATIENT X137
Right, sure.

DOCTOR X137
It looks like you had @@@.

PATIENT X137
Right, right.

DOCTOR X137
What symptoms were you having for those?

PATIENT X137
The first one they read an EKG, the doctor said the computer read the EKG.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.

PATIENT X137
And indicated I had a heart attack.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.

PATIENT X137
And it says that was totally incorrect but now that I had something that said I had a heart attack, he had to prove it's wrong.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.

PATIENT X137
And then the last one my insurance was expiring so he.

DOCTOR X137
Oh.

PATIENT X137
It's just @@@.

DOCTOR X137
And currently you're doing well, you have no complaints?

PATIENT X137

PATIENT X137
Eating less, exercising more yeah.

DOCTOR X137
How much have you lost?

PATIENT X137
Uh probably about 17 pounds.

DOCTOR X137
Oh excellent.

PATIENT X137
It's been a lot of struggle but it's getting down there.

DOCTOR X137
That's great.

PATIENT X137
Well I felt myself gaining weight again and I knew that's not good for diabetes and everything else in the body so.

DOCTOR X137
Now remind me about your colonoscopy.  Did you have, when was the last time you had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X137
I had one when I was 59 and.

DOCTOR X137

DOCTOR X137
Of the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X137
Yes.  

DOCTOR X137
And remind me are you retired?

PATIENT X137

PATIENT X137
Well certainly.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.  Okay I got that done.

PATIENT X137
In fact they had a job fair here last week, I came in.

DOCTOR X137
Did they really?

PATIENT X137
Yeah, so that was sort of a farce.

DOCTOR X137
And you're no longer drinking?

PATIENT X137

DOCTOR X137
And you're no longer smoking?

PATIENT X137
@@@, yes.

DOCTOR X137
How years have you smoked for?

PATIENT X137
I think I quit in the mid 70s, I probably started it was about 16, 17, so @@@.

DOCTOR X137
We may repeat a urine.  In February.

PATIENT X137
February or March.

DOCTOR X137
Okay if you just had one then we'll see.  Um, they found some trace blood.  I just want to make sure there's no.

PATIENT X137
I had that before and I went through all kinds of tests and they didn't find anything.

DOCTOR X137
You did a cystoscopy?  Did they put a camera up your penis?

PATIENT X137
Yes.

DOCTOR X137
Oh they did.

PATIENT X137
Oh yeah that was fun.

DOCTOR X137
I bet.

PATIENT X137
Otherwise I could back track, um I'm guessing maybe five, eight years ago.

DOCTOR X137
Alright.

PATIENT X137
And then I had a series of tests uh.  I had a CAT scan associated with that as well as a uh another test, I can't remember what it was.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah your HIV was negative.  Vitamin B12 was all normal and your blood was.  Yeah you have two UAs with blood.  Let's repeat one.  Well you have the results, when was the cystoscopy?  Do you remember when that was?

PATIENT X137
Uh no I think I missed it, let me see.  I'll have to check that for the next time.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.  Do you remember approximately when it was like a year ago, two years ago?

PATIENT X137
No it was probably five to eight years ago.

DOCTOR X137
I'm going to repeat a UA today okay.

PATIENT X137
What's that?

DOCTOR X137
Just urine and some blood tests.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
We'll do a pee in cup.  Okay, let's have you come over there and @@@ 166/80 when the nurse checked it.

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
You go to the nurse check, that's okay.

PATIENT X137
Yep.

DOCTOR X137
The nurse check was higher um.  Have you been following all this madness with the basketball stuff, all these people speculating about xxx xxx?

PATIENT X137
No.

DOCTOR X137
No.

PATIENT X137
I'm not.

DOCTOR X137
xxx's going, they're all going crazy.

PATIENT X137
@@@.

DOCTOR X137
He's a famous basketball player, who everybody, everybody and their cousin wants to sign has put xxx in a frenzy on all the shows.

PATIENT X137
@@@.

DOCTOR X137
Get xxx Jordan back here but I don't know and I don't care how good you are, I don't know that there's going to be anybody as good as that guy.  He was pretty. 

PATIENT X137
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X137
Pretty amazing.  Unfortunately for me, I was a Phoenix Suns fan growing up.

PATIENT X137
Oh oh.

DOCTOR X137
The Phoenix Suns never had much success against them.

PATIENT X137
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X137
Especially when they played them in the finals and lost, that was no fun.  Fun for people here but.

PATIENT X137
@@@.

DOCTOR X137
It's a little high.  Did you take your blood pressure pills today?

PATIENT X137
I take them at night.

DOCTOR X137
Do you take all of them at night?

PATIENT X137
Oh no I take both of them, I'm still getting here @@@.

DOCTOR X137
So @@@.

PATIENT X137
What?

DOCTOR X137
Do you mean that you haven't been taking your lisinopril?

PATIENT X137
No, no.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.

PATIENT X137
@@@.

DOCTOR X137
Maybe that's the reason why your blood pressure is so high.  Maybe your, now that we restart the lisinopril it probably should come back down.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
What I would do is, that way when you get it downstairs, take it and then maybe, make sure that, maybe next week like on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, come in for the nurse practitioner here or just call me after.  You have a blood pressure cuff right?

PATIENT X137
Yep.

DOCTOR X137
So I'll have you check it and call me with the blood pressure, make sure the lisinopril is kicking in.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
How long have you not been taking the lisinopril?

PATIENT X137
Couple months probably.

DOCTOR X137
Oh that long.

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
That long okay.

PATIENT X137
That's what I was saying, you need to address @@@.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah, definitely want to put you on that.  Okay I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X137
Alright and then the ones that were for 30 days, are you going to change those to 90 days?

DOCTOR X137
I did.

PATIENT X137
So that was two of them?  I forgot what two.

DOCTOR X137
Um.

PATIENT X137
@@@.

DOCTOR X137
It would be lisinopril, metoprolol and the glyburide.  I gave you 120 of the metoprolol and then you have 90 of the glipizide.

PATIENT X137
Oh wait I'm only take a half, I'm taking one a day.

DOCTOR X137
Of the what?  The glyburide?

PATIENT X137
The metoprolol.

DOCTOR X137
Right.

PATIENT X137
I'm taking one pill.

DOCTOR X137
Right.

PATIENT X137
Cutting in half.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.

PATIENT X137
Taking a half in the morning and @@@.

DOCTOR X137
Well you're taking half a pill twice a day right?

PATIENT X137
Right so I'm taking one pill a day.

DOCTOR X137
Correct.  @@@ You said that you want more than what you're getting.  You want 90 instead of 30.

PATIENT X137
Right.

DOCTOR X137
So with what we give you, you're going to have plenty.

PATIENT X137
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.  Okay I'll be right back.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:20  DOCTOR IN:  41:41)

DOCTOR X137
Alright.  Well my attending thinks that um she's okay with checking your UA but if you have no symptoms then we'll just leave it alone.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
In terms of looking for, the last one was technically negative for red blood cells, the one before that had some in it.  So if you're not having any symptoms we'll just let it be.

PATIENT X137
Well that's what started the first time, it was high and it shouldn't have been over 3.

DOCTOR X137
Uh we will, so this one is ready for you to pick up, these two won't since you have plenty of them or we can mail them to you.

PATIENT X137
Well I'll go @@@.  Um so what am I going to pick up today?

DOCTOR X137
Lisinopril.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
And then call the nurse, call us up on like Monday or Tuesday to make sure your blood pressure really can you know, came back down uh.  Since you've been on the lisinopril.

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.

PATIENT X137
Well what should it read other than this?

DOCTOR X137
Well no so these ones were, I guess my point is if you recently ran out of them, these readings were.

PATIENT X137
No it was three months ago.

DOCTOR X137
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X137
Actually or more, I think it was more than two months ago.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.  It was up, before breakfast, oh here's your blood pressure, 119, 120, 160, @@@.  Yeah for the uh diabetes you really shouldn't be on an H inhibitor.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
Um so what I would say is just a low dose of lisinopril.

PATIENT X137
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X137
Something like 10 mg daily.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
But make sure that it doesn't go, if your blood pressure goes low or you get dizzy stop taking it.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.

PATIENT X137
What about the Flomax and finasteride?

DOCTOR X137
Um.

PATIENT X137
I was on that before, I don't have any other than.

DOCTOR X137
So the way the VA works is that I think I have to put in for terazosin it's a similar one.

PATIENT X137
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X137
Uh but basically we'll do like a starter pack and you slowly work your way up on that, you want that for a month.  In other words the VA, they get the terazosin.

PATIENT X137
Well I don't have any prescriptions, any remaining prescriptions from the old doctors.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.  So then why don't I do that then?

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
I'll put in for terazosin a starter pack.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
And then you'll use, it's like one pill for the first week then two pills and three pills or whatever for a month.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
But because the VA, because of the cheapness of the medication, whatever the cost is to the VA they do one that's similar but it's called terazosin.

PATIENT X137
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR X137
So I'll put that.

PATIENT X137
Alright.

DOCTOR X137
And then because you're doing so well, you don't need to see me for like six months.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
Cause you're really, you're doing real good.

PATIENT X137
Alright but then I went on uh My Healthy Vets, the online guide.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.

PATIENT X137
There are tips for wellness.  They were talking about a diabetic eye exam.

DOCTOR X137
Okay.  Have you been to @@@.

PATIENT X137
A foot exam.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah the foot exam you don't have to go to anybody to do it.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
As long you @@@.

PATIENT X137
And then they talked about heart attacks.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah you've got @@@.  When was the last time you saw somebody from @@@ though?

PATIENT X137
Uh probably three years ago.

DOCTOR X137
Okay let's do, here you had May 2000, I have the surveillance in here.

PATIENT X137
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X137
Diabetic retinopathy surveillance.  Did you make that pending.  So it looks like I ordered and maybe we just didn't set up the appointment.

PATIENT X137
I didn't know anything about it.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah so let's, let's go, when you go to the front we'll do the consults and diabetic retinopathy.  Come with me we'll set this up and.

PATIENT X137
Alright then you were going to print out the uh.

DOCTOR X137
Oh the um tests um hmm.  @@@ all one location.  What specifically do you want to know?

PATIENT X137
Well generally I get the blood test results.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah.

PATIENT X137
I got the A1c and all the blood work, cholesterols and that.

DOCTOR X137
Let's do this, these are your, you're not going to want those um.  I don't know how to put them all on one thing um.  Tell you what um, they don't show up on the web, you can't look them up on the web?

PATIENT X137
Not yet.

DOCTOR X137
Hmm.  So the problem is just kind of trying to, I don't know how to print all of the.

PATIENT X137
They give you places where you can put in the information that you have but if you don't know the results you can't get it.

DOCTOR X137
Um let's see what happens if I do labs cumulative, let's see what will happen if I print this.

PATIENT X137
Right.

DOCTOR X137
I'm going to try and print this and see if I can get this to actually work.  Okay come with me and then I'm going to see if this printed or not.  I'll be back in like 10 seconds you can have a seat right there.

PATIENT X137
Right here, okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:25  DOCTOR IN:  46:50)

DOCTOR X137
Here we go.

PATIENT X137
Oh thank you.

DOCTOR X137
Again, uh basically what it does it look like it's going to put in to, @@@ UA.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
Key areas like basically BNP, so the thing that's important here.

PATIENT X137
Does it give me a cholesterol here?

DOCTOR X137
Here this is the hemoglobin A1c, @@@.

PATIENT X137
@@@

DOCTOR X137
@@@

PATIENT X137
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X137
That's the important one.

PATIENT X137
How about the, yeah that would be affected if I was fasting right?

DOCTOR X137
No because it's a measurement of three months.

PATIENT X137
Oh three months.

DOCTOR X137
Okay and another one that's important okay.

PATIENT X137
But those should have been fasting and they weren't right so.

DOCTOR X137
Uh these ones?

PATIENT X137
Yeah.

DOCTOR X137
No I think, oh you weren't fasting when you did those?

PATIENT X137
No, @@@.

DOCTOR X137
Yeah well they're good despite that, these are all good.

PATIENT X137
Okay.

DOCTOR X137
Uh and then well these are all the important ones.

PATIENT X137

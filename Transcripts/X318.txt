DOCTOR X318
PATIENT?  Okay, how's it going?

PATIENT X318
Okay.  I'm fine.

DOCTOR X318
The last time you came in, you had some dizziness.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
And they gave you two liters of fluid.

PATIENT X318
Right.

DOCTOR X318
Downstairs in the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
How are things going now?

PATIENT X318
Pretty good, every now and then I get a little dizzy.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
Sometimes I get up too much and too fast.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
And then you know, almost all the medications I'm taking say could cause dizziness.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah but they just put that stuff on there, to cover their butt.  Your blood pressure is a little bit on the lower side.

PATIENT X318
Oh.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah you're pretty well set.  The quetiapine I think can cause dizziness.  Okay.  How'd the Parkinson's medication go?

PATIENT X318
Alright.  I don't know how, what it's supposed to do for me you know.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
Sometimes I suck on my teeth, if I don't pay attention I do it you know.

DOCTOR X318
And do you have a tremor?  Do you have another tremor?  No.

PATIENT X318
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.

PATIENT X318
Never did.

DOCTOR X318
Who said you had Parkinson's?

PATIENT X318
Huh?

DOCTOR X318
Who said that you had Parkinson's?  Who diagnosed you?

PATIENT X318
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X318
Here okay.

PATIENT X318
He said symptoms.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.  So then you worked with DOCTOR.  You're not feeling um dizzy or anything.

PATIENT X318
Uh uh.  Sometimes you know I’m doing too much around the house cause I'm home all day and my daughter's working, I'll cook and I'll clean and I'm mopping or vacuuming and I may get a little bit dizzy but that's it.  It's that my appetite is seems to be worse.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.

PATIENT X318
But I'm 180.  In 1953 when I got out of the service I was 175, so in 50 years I gained five pounds.  I don't think that's too bad.

DOCTOR X318
Thanks @@@ again.

PATIENT X318
I know.

DOCTOR X318
And you're not falling down or anything?

PATIENT X318
No.  A couple times I tripped you know.

DOCTOR X318
Oh.

PATIENT X318
I missed that road and not paying attention.

DOCTOR X318
Right.

PATIENT X318
Cause I've been slowing down on that.

DOCTOR X318
@@@.  Anything else going on?

PATIENT X318
Nothing.

DOCTOR X318
I think I brought you in mainly to mention that.

PATIENT X318
Huh?

DOCTOR X318
I think I brought you in mainly, we just saw you in February right?  I brought you in mainly to make sure that that dizziness had resolved.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh, well it happens but not where it bothers me seriously.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  The last time was a little different?

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.  I uh I'm having a little more trouble with my prostate.

DOCTOR X318
Okay so some of the questions that the VA wants us to ask you about is urination.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
Do you have weak urine and do accidentally or anything like that?

PATIENT X318
No it's just that uh I have to go more, more frequently and that you know I have two @@@ one leads to the other so sometimes I get a little tingling down there and I don't know if it's from the tube.

DOCTOR X318
Like what tube?

PATIENT X318
From the prostate to my bladder.

DOCTOR X318
From a tube I have?

PATIENT X318
Yeah well you getting any blood flow here so they cathed me.

DOCTOR X318
Oh that, yeah.  No that should have nothing to do with it.

PATIENT X318
Hmm.  But I'm getting discomfort down there.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.  Okay.  Uh how often do you urinate at night?

PATIENT X318
A day, now today I couldn't count it but at night at least eight times in the night.

DOCTOR X318
You get up to go urinate?

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
And um are you able to completely empty your bladder?

PATIENT X318
Sometimes, not always.  I feel like uh you know I could but I get tired of standing there and give up.

DOCTOR X318
Okay so you have some problems emptying your bladder okay.

PATIENT X318
I feel like I haven't emptied it you know.

DOCTOR X318
Okay right and then when you um, what was I doing, when you do urinate is the stream weak?

PATIENT X318
It's different you know.  It'll be you know pretty good and then it'll settle down, be weak and stop and then start again.

DOCTOR X318
And how long has that been going on?

PATIENT X318
Months.  And I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
And my daughters buy me lots of Gatorade and I see in the paper and on TV Gatorade isn't all that good.  They say Pedialyte is better.

DOCTOR X318
Oh.

PATIENT X318
That they give to the kids.

DOCTOR X318
Oh that has a lot of sugar in it.

PATIENT X318
Not Gatorade 2.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.

PATIENT X318
Gatorade 2 has about 5 mg.

DOCTOR X318
Oh is that right.

PATIENT X318
The other ones are like 19 or something like that.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah it has a lot of sugar.

PATIENT X318
Yeah, yeah so I make sure.

DOCTOR X318
Good.

PATIENT X318
Gatorade 2 but then again most of the time I stay away from sugar and I'm constantly in that cookie bowl.  I'm worse than my grandkids.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  Um and then you're on medication for the prostate, did you know that?

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.  Finasteride.

DOCTOR X318
Finasteride, good and you take that every day?

PATIENT X318
Yeah.  I was on two.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah you used to have two.

PATIENT X318
And they cut the one back, uh Flomax cause they thought that was giving me the dizziness.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah, we could have probably done Flomax again.

PATIENT X318
And I think we should.

DOCTOR X318
Does that make it better?

PATIENT X318
Yeah I thought it was better with Flomax.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  Yeah all those medications are going to cause a little bit but I'll talk to my boss about it.

PATIENT X318
I mean if.

DOCTOR X318
We could try it.

PATIENT X318
If I start taking it and I get dizzy then no problem, we know that was the problem.

DOCTOR X318
Right, right.  Have you ever had a prostate biopsy?

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
Oh your symptoms.

PATIENT X318
A long time ago I had a biopsy.

DOCTOR X318
And that was negative?

PATIENT X318
There was a cut @@@ and I don't know how many samples he took but I was ready to come off that table.  It was painful.

DOCTOR X318
Let's see and you're supposed to, hmm they scheduled to see the urologist.

PATIENT X318
I didn't.

DOCTOR X318
You're seeing Urology May 25th.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
So what we could do, oh no April 2nd, you'll see Urology April 2nd.  So what we could do is try @@@ so try the Flomax again.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
And you'll follow up with them in May and they can tell you what to do with it.

PATIENT X318
@@@.

DOCTOR X318
Okay um well let me check your blood pressure again.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
Have a seat up there.  

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
That's.

PATIENT X318
I just came.

DOCTOR X318
The way you walk.

PATIENT X318
Huh?

DOCTOR X318
Like this, that's called a shuffled gait.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
And that happens with Parkinson's.

PATIENT X318
I know.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  Cause otherwise, usually.

PATIENT X318
Last time you know.

DOCTOR X318
You don't have a tremor.

PATIENT X318
No, no.  Seems like when I get up that's when I @@@.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
And then every day I walk outside.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah you have a little bit of cog, and then you also have this thing called, maybe you do, a little bit, not that bad.  You also have this thing called cogwheeling rigidity

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
So it's in people who have @@@ Parkinson's and @@@ rigidity.

PATIENT X318
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X318
Which I don't think you have but you're on medication so maybe you did before, did you do this?  I thought I felt @@@ second.  @@@ neurologist.  I think you may have a little bit of it.

PATIENT X318
And this elbow has arthritis in the morning and sometimes it @@@ me.

DOCTOR X318
Oh, do you take anything for it?

PATIENT X318
No.  I have to see the arthritis doctor sometime in the next.

DOCTOR X318
Do you take Tylenol?

PATIENT X318
Uh no.

DOCTOR X318
You can take Tylenol.

PATIENT X318
Yeah but I'm not, I'm not taking any now.

DOCTOR X318
Take some Tylenol for the pain.  I can order it for you.  You can take a gram, up to a gram a every six hours.

PATIENT X318
Yeah that would help.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
Especially in the morning when I wake up.

DOCTOR X318
I can order it @@@.

PATIENT X318
But sometimes it hurts when I sleep on it you know.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
And that makes it.

DOCTOR X318
@@@.

PATIENT X318
And it seems like the right elbow is always colder than the left.  Why is that?

DOCTOR X318
Um, that I don't know.  It could be um the same artery disease that you have in your legs and your heart; it could be in the arms too.

PATIENT X318
And then I was feeling pretty good, I was in Arizona for two weeks.  I come back the night before last and just as soon as I get out there it's cold.  It was 58 degrees in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
Cause I'm going to @@@ from there and it was 81 in xxx.

DOCTOR X318
Isn't that funny?

PATIENT X318
It's crazy.

DOCTOR X318
It is.  I was actually, I was in @@@ and I was flying back and I had to land in xxx before I got to xxx and it was warm in xxx last weekend than it was here and I was in xxx.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
Weird.  Now it's starting to cool down.

PATIENT X318
And I was in; I was in xxx xxx which is one of the warmest.  It's only 10 minutes from the @@@.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
And I couldn't believe the temperature and my daughter yes its fine @@@.  As soon as I get there it drops.

DOCTOR X318
@@@.

PATIENT X318
Oh.

DOCTOR X318
Alright.  Okay and then relax your arm as much as you can, try to bend your elbow, just like that, perfect.  You're blood pressure is hard to feel.

PATIENT X318
Hmm.  That arm is always lower than this arm.  Why I don't know.  I think there's some blockage the doctor said.

DOCTOR X318
I'll try that arm.

PATIENT X318
What was it?

DOCTOR X318
That's 150 too.  Yeah there was a big difference.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
So it was 108/68 on this side and I couldn't even hear it on that side.

PATIENT X318
Yeah they tell me there's a blockage.

DOCTOR X318
@@@.

PATIENT X318
When I had my heart attack, why didn't I tell them and I said how could I tell you cause I didn't know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X318
And which arm is cold?

PATIENT X318
It's the elbow.

DOCTOR X318
Oh the elbow's cold, but this arm is still okay.  Hmm.  There you go.  Yeah it's easier to feel a pulse on this side.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
You must have a blockage in that arm.

PATIENT X318
That's what he said that.

DOCTOR X318
I don't think there's any, @@@ this means, pink means blood flow.  But that doesn't that needs to be done, it's something to watch.  Did you used to be a drinker?

PATIENT X318
Used to be.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.

PATIENT X318
I quit 32 years ago February 19th.

DOCTOR X318
Wow, @@@ huh.  Just stand up.  Okay with this arm out, do you ever notice this arm getting cool or something?

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
That means there may be you know a really bad blockage in here, maybe permanent blockage that we have to intervene on and if it gets cool you go straight to the hospital okay.

PATIENT X318
@@@.

DOCTOR X318
Any numbness or tingling or anything like that in the arms go straight to the hospital and tell them that you know.

PATIENT X318
Yeah the blockage.

DOCTOR X318
That you may have a blockage in this arm.  And they'll be able to feel the pulses are not equal.

PATIENT X318
The same with that shuffling thing.

DOCTOR X318
You can stand up.

PATIENT X318
When I first get up that happens.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
To walk.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT X318
I'll get my cane, I go outside and I start walking normal, no shuffle and it seems like it only happens when I get up or when I have back pain.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh back pain can cause it.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.  Most of the time it's the back pain.

DOCTOR X318
Do you have any or are you feeling dizzy right now?

PATIENT X318
No.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  Take some deep breaths in and out for me.  Good.  Okay let’s take your blood pressure standing up.  Let's stand over here and then turn around.  This will be easier.  I think I'll get you to take this off, I think you can take it off.  Alright, oops.  @@@.  Okay, the same @@@.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
Now the other one.  @@@.

PATIENT X318
@@@ huh.

DOCTOR X318
There we go.  Okay and lean forward, there you go.  Okay, so it's 94/68 in this arm here.  So the blood pressure dropped.

PATIENT X318
Yeah I know it dropped.

DOCTOR X318
And that seems like @@@.

PATIENT X318
And this thing with the drinking when I first come home, I was a wreck.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
And I came here and they did like almost a family doctor.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
They put me on phenobarbital.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
And another pill and I @@@.   So I noticed that when I took the @@@ that it relaxed me.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
And from relaxing me it damn near killed me.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah.

PATIENT X318
So I had to give that up.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  So @@@ about that.

PATIENT X318
Pardon?

DOCTOR X318
I'm going to talk to my boss about what he thinks about starting on the tamsulosin and making sure that's okay.

PATIENT X318
Yes.

DOCTOR X318
I'm willing to try it uh and I do want you to watch your blood pressures.  And then we may bring you back in to see the nurse to check your blood pressures again.  Do you live far away?

PATIENT X318
20 minutes.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  Let me go talk to my boss, what do you think?

PATIENT X318
Uh so I start taking today or tomorrow or?

DOCTOR X318
Well let me ask and he may say that.

PATIENT X318
Okay.

DOCTOR X318
I just have to run this by him; he may say I can't do that.

PATIENT X318
And it was just one tablet.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah, take one cause it's the same dose every time.  I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  86:40  DOCTOR IN:  94:10)

DOCTOR X318
Okay, so the boss is okay with starting the Flomax and I'll order that for you.  And we need to watch your blood pressure, that lowers your blood pressure you know.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
Yeah so that's why we stopped it before right?

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
So be careful.

PATIENT X318
@@@.

DOCTOR X318
Right and we thought you were getting dizzy because.

PATIENT X318
Flomax.

DOCTOR X318
Flomax lowers blood pressure.  If your blood pressure's low you'll feel dizzy.

PATIENT X318
And Tylenol and Flomax.

DOCTOR X318
Tylenol yeah.  So do you want me to send them both to your house?

PATIENT X318
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
We'll give you the higher strength of the Tylenol.

PATIENT X318
Okay.

DOCTOR X318
Um.

PATIENT X318
Sometimes with that back pain.

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
I take four pills of hydrocortisone is it?

DOCTOR X318
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X318
And sometimes I'll take a half a pill and then go for a walk and I have no trouble you know.  It relieves that pain in the back cause that causes me to walk funny.

DOCTOR X318
Okay and Flomax you're supposed to take it every night right.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.  I just yeah.

DOCTOR X318
And it's pretty @@@ blood pressure medications but it still can.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
If you feel dizzy at all with it, stop it okay and you can come see our nurse in two weeks to get the blood pressure checked and make sure that it's not lowering your blood pressure.

PATIENT X318
Will they send me a letter?

DOCTOR X318
Yeah we'll set it up today, you can schedule it before you leave and then you're going to see Urology as scheduled in April, you know about that appointment right?

PATIENT X318
Yeah April 4th is it?

DOCTOR X318

PATIENT X318
Yeah.  I'm remembering.

DOCTOR X318

PATIENT X318

DOCTOR X318
Okay but you have it on your calendar?

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
Right?

PATIENT X318
I got a calendar just for appointments.

DOCTOR X318
You can see me in six months.  Okay.  Okay, I think that's all we need.  Oh, no, no, no and then there's one more thing.  I need you to go to Vascular Lab.  This asymmetry thing, he said we got to look into that.

PATIENT X318
The what?

DOCTOR X318
Oh the fact that your blood pressures are different on the different sides.

PATIENT X318
Oh on the one side yeah.

DOCTOR X318
We got to look into it okay.

PATIENT X318
Okay.

DOCTOR X318
For that, the Vascular Lab will take care of it.  It's like just an ultrasound, it doesn't hurt.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
And um they'll call you and schedule it.

PATIENT X318
Okay.  I was wondering when they did that bypass here they didn't feel that.

DOCTOR X318
Probably did yeah.

PATIENT X318
And I'm quite sure they took it.

DOCTOR X318
At the arm?

PATIENT X318
Maybe it was a different.

DOCTOR X318
Oh the blood pressures yeah.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
Okay, so I'm just going to add that in as a consult so they'll call you okay.

PATIENT X318
They'll call me and I'm good at forgetting.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  And you're not having symptoms with that.  When you use your arms, it sounds like you said your right elbow sometimes feels cold.

PATIENT X318
@@@.

DOCTOR X318
But otherwise nothing?

PATIENT X318
Uh uh.  @@@.

DOCTOR X318
And how much did you used to smoke?

PATIENT X318
A couple of packs a day.

DOCTOR X318

DOCTOR X318
And you said you have no weight loss.  And you aren't coughing up blood or?

PATIENT X318
No.

DOCTOR X318
You have night sweats and I think you said no to and are you having any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X318

Fevers or chills?

PATIENT X318
No.

DOCTOR X318
Okay.  Okay.  Okay, that is it.

PATIENT X318
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X318
Okay and so you just go up to the front.

PATIENT X318
And give this to them.

DOCTOR X318
And schedule the nurse visit.

PATIENT X318
Okay.

DOCTOR X318
And they'll do this, you just have to show them the paper and then they'll put in an order, they won't schedule this one today but they'll put it in the computer and will send an automatic message.

PATIENT X318
Yeah.

DOCTOR X318
To set up to remind you to schedule this in six months.  Okay.

PATIENT X318
Very, very good.

DOCTOR X318

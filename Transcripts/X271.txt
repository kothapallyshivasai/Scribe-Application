DOCTOR X271
PATIENT?  

PATIENT X271
I get along, how are you today?

DOCTOR X271
Good.  You survived everything since the last time I saw you.

PATIENT X271
Well I have intermittently.

DOCTOR X271
Well I hope we were able to help you out there with everything that's happened.  Good.  @@@.

PATIENT X271
I'm able to lie in bed and read more.

DOCTOR X271
Good.  Okay that's what I asking if at night.  @@@ stress, maybe it's just for @@@ but we should get it checked anyway.  

PATIENT X271
Oh my God, @@@ extended an area so @@@ and it works like a champ as I say.

DOCTOR X271
Good.  How are you with your activities?

PATIENT X271
Increasing.  Yeah, frustrating now but.

DOCTOR X271
Good.

PATIENT X271
Um, timely enough about a month ago my car broke.  

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
And I can't afford to fix it yet.  I'll get it fixed next week, payday comes in next week and uh that doesn't mean I don't have a car.  I just do my running around in the evenings when my daughter's home or on the weekends.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
Or I put my two little flat things and I hoof it off because there's a large mall two blocks from our house.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
So if I had, I have not gone there, why?  There's no reason, nothing new over there and uh the evil is every fast food place you could think of in the world is within a half mile of our house so I can go eat something grubby instead of eating good out of the refrigerator.  But uh overall I have some stuff I want to talk to you about today.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
Uh and number one I have, I don't know what it is but if I stretch my out and then pull on something I get sharp burning pains through the upper arm.  I don't know.  At one time I think I was told tendinitis, I don't know if that's what it is.

DOCTOR X271
How long has this been going on?

PATIENT X271
It's been bothering me now for about a month.  

DOCTOR X271
And that's when you, like this or like this?

PATIENT X271
Yeah, when I okay, I can go from straight up, up to there and it starts to get painful.

DOCTOR X271
And show me exactly where is the pain?

PATIENT X271
Right in here.

DOCTOR X271
Right here?

PATIENT X271
Primarily here but it will run down almost to the elbow.

DOCTOR X271
And it never goes past the elbow?

PATIENT X271
No not past the elbow.

DOCTOR X271
You can extend it down.  Does that hurt?

PATIENT X271
Uh, hurt no, uncomfortable yes.

DOCTOR X271
Okay I'm gonna push, resist me okay.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
How is that, okay?

PATIENT X271
Downward it doesn't bother it okay.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
That doesn't bother anyway.

DOCTOR X271
Okay it's not a rotator cuff so that's fine okay.

PATIENT X271
I'm not a jock; you got to be a jock to have that.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah you never know.

PATIENT X271
I don't know, when you get old, I thought today I had cataracts.

DOCTOR X271
You know everybody gets cataracts eventually.

PATIENT X271
I know.

DOCTOR X271
Are they going to operate?

PATIENT X271
Well, he says you have the beginnings.  Everybody tells you inside of the next four years that you need them fixed, tell them to stick it.

DOCTOR X271
Good.

PATIENT X271
So they're just.  The first time anybody's ever mentioned it.

DOCTOR X271
Eventually, when you, when they'll probably need to be fixed, you'll probably know it cause things will start looking yellow.

PATIENT X271
A little fuzzy.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
My wife was an ophthalmic technician.

DOCTOR X271
Oh.

PATIENT X271
So when you get into the eyeball side of things we spent many years.  I used to be her prepper and quiz her for questions when she had to take a test.

DOCTOR X271
I know they ask you @@2.

PATIENT X271
And so me and the eyeball get together probably better than anything else other than maybe heart and the little bit because of my involvement with that.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
That was complaint number one.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
Number two, it has been brought to my attention that I couldn't hear a board hitting up the side of the head according to my daughter.

DOCTOR X271
That you're deaf?

PATIENT X271
Huh?

DOCTOR X271
And she said it's not selective hearing is it?

PATIENT X271
Well I tried to explain that once to her but it worked as well as when my wife explained it, no, no, that's genetic, women get it, men don't.  Oh yes dear.

DOCTOR X271
Well I heard that usually @@@.

PATIENT X271
I know and you know how I, you know what are you married?

DOCTOR X271
Yes.

PATIENT X271
You try that on your wife and it doesn't work very well.

DOCTOR X271
You got blood drawn today, well let me check your hearing here in a second and then we'll review all your labs today too.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
Which actually look excellent.  Whatever you're doing it, you're doing it all right okay.  Um.

PATIENT X271
What is this my chemical one?

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.  Your cholesterol perfect, its right where you need to be so you're going to significantly reduce and prevent your risk of any further events.

PATIENT X271
Good.  We have to talk about another subject than that subject too than that.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.  Let me check the hearing real quick.  Why don't you have a seat up here because I need to look inside.  

PATIENT X271
My father, in the second World War was in the Army artillery.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
Boom, boom, boom.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
So I grew up as a teenager with dad being halfway close to stone deaf.  That meant the TV was turned way up and you had to yell to get his attention.

DOCTOR X271
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X271
Well then he went to retire in 1959 from the Army after 20 years and then I said well maybe your ears need to have a look and they had come up with an operation where they took all those little pieces matter.

DOCTOR X271
Sure.

PATIENT X271
And you of course know, you don't know @@@ stir up etc.  

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
You know about that long @@@ but they could push him out the other.

DOCTOR X271
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X271
Well they did that and then they sent the old fart home.  And the first day he's home, I walked and said hey dad how you doing, you shout at me again and I'll break your legs.  Oh shit, does this mean I got to be quiet?

DOCTOR X271
It worked.

PATIENT X271
Yeah it worked like a champ but it took a long time.  I had three younger brothers, between the four of us, for us not to come storming in the house yelling.

DOCTOR X271
Cause you were conditioned.

PATIENT X271
Oh my God.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.  You were trained already to try to.

PATIENT X271
I told my mother well you know we learned okay and she was an RN so.

DOCTOR X271
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X271
She understood that but, dad didn't.

DOCTOR X271
You've never been exposed to loud noises have you?

PATIENT X271
Flying the jet airplanes in the Navy.

DOCTOR X271
You did okay.  Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X271
Up yeah.

DOCTOR X271
So you've got a risk of this too.  Okay no wax in this one and do you think there's one here that's worse than the other?

PATIENT X271
If I were pick the right one is probably.  I take a Q-Tip and I don't go shoving it in there.  I'll just to this front level.

DOCTOR X271
That's perfect.

PATIENT X271
And take it around and around.  Every once in a while I come with a hunk of wax; sometimes I come out with exactly nothing.

DOCTOR X271
There is zero wax in there right now, it looks good.  Never push it any further than where you push it now.

PATIENT X271
No, no.

DOCTOR X271
Good.

PATIENT X271
Those are inside parts, we mustn't mess with any of those.

DOCTOR X271
Close your eyes for me.  Do you hear noises?

PATIENT X271
Yes I hear a high-pitched squeal.  

DOCTOR X271
Really?

PATIENT X271
Oh you're thumping your finger over it but I saw it so that's not fair.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.  Did you not hear it?

PATIENT X271
Could not hear it before I opened my eyes no.  Now I can hear your right, your left, I could hear the right.

DOCTOR X271
But not the left huh.  You can open again.  I might as well finish examining you since you're here and I need to.

PATIENT X271
Alright.

DOCTOR X271
What else is on your mind?

PATIENT X271
When I first started getting this.  Five years ago I had this stuff and my daughter was gonna see a chiropractor.  Well I have Medicare so I get to go see him.  I get 24 adjustments off him.  @@@.  He didn't, just as bad now.  But he took x-rays as they do all around the spine.

DOCTOR X271
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X271
And he showed me the x-ray taken from the side in the abdominal area that had this little white tube above the spine.  He says you got calcification in your aorta.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
And I said okay and he said tell your doctor that.  Consider yourself told.

DOCTOR X271
Have you ever smoked?

PATIENT X271
Uh for a week in 1962.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.  Now are you 66?

PATIENT X271
No I'm 67 next month or in February.

DOCTOR X271
You don't look 67, you look good um.

PATIENT X271
Living with Italian women.  I'd recommend it highly right now.

DOCTOR X271
Well one thing I was gonna say is that if you were 65 and you had smoked before all the studies show that you qualify for an abdominal ultrasound to look for an aneurysm.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
That's what we worry about when we hear about calcifications.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.  I've got a good heart, if it's gonna go pop well that's a different story.

DOCTOR X271
That's a different, yeah because if it's an aneurysm.

PATIENT X271
Yeah immediately internally, immediately fatal is what it is.

DOCTOR X271
So I mean it, technically you don't qualify for that study.  If you wanted one I can order it for you.

PATIENT X271
I think, well let me ask you this, am I in serious trouble?

DOCTOR X271
Let me close this door.  Sorry, I just thought.

PATIENT X271
If this is something that's gonna make me jump off the roof I don't want to know about it.

DOCTOR X271
I saw people walking out there out of the corner of my eye.

PATIENT X271
I know.

DOCTOR X271
Um.

PATIENT X271
If it's something, you kind of like we jumped on the stent and everything and knocked that out real quick.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
Okay.  I'm due in another six months or thereabouts to see DOCTOR or.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah DOCTOR.

PATIENT X271
Again as a cardiologist.  Well to me that's the tube that goes out of the heart.

DOCTOR X271
That is the aorta uh-huh.

PATIENT X271
And I would bring it up to him if I'm not putting myself in a hazardous place by not doing anything about it right now.

DOCTOR X271
I don't think you are.  I think, I have to look this up real quick.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
Because I know that if you're a smoker, I would immediately counsel doing the screening but you're not.  But you know that you have a history of blocked arteries on.

PATIENT X271
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X271
I'm almost inclined to just get the test and make sure.

PATIENT X271
@@@ in theory.

DOCTOR X271
Okay well they can't do it today anyway.

PATIENT X271
I know.

DOCTOR X271
What's gonna happen is I think you have to be fasting beforehand so that there's no food content that's blocking the aorta.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
Okay, so let's plan on getting that tested.

PATIENT X271
I will read my mail closely and look for it.

DOCTOR X271
Very good.  You don't get belly pain or anything like that, okay.  I'll check for a second.  Seldomly, you can actually hear these things with a stethoscope or you can palpate them.  But we'd be in trouble if we're able to do that.

PATIENT X271
Usually that is when the aneurysm is about as big as my fist.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
Which means I'm going to lay down very carefully here while you go get someone to bring a gurney in here.

DOCTOR X271
That's what would happen.

PATIENT X271
And we'd head downstairs.

DOCTOR X271
Good.  Deep breaths.  Okay now let's have you lay down flat.  Everything sounds good so far.  Can you pull your shirt up for me PATIENT?  Okay.  And remind me what's this scar from?

PATIENT X271
Huh?

DOCTOR X271
Remind me what's this scar from?

PATIENT X271
Oh I had a quad bypass.

DOCTOR X271
Okay that's right you had a big, okay so.

PATIENT X271
It was supposed to be a three-fer but I got this used car salesman kind of pitch while they had it opened, they went ahead and did the fourth one.  It was a xxx job.

DOCTOR X271
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X271
I was a stray.  I told DOCTOR that and he's like really.

DOCTOR X271
You know we're all from xxx actually, although I chose to stay at xxx for the next year completely actually.  I don't really hear or feel anything so I think we're okay.  Kind of a lot of layers to go through though before I get to hear the aorta.

PATIENT X271
Be nice.  Be nice.  We're working on it.

DOCTOR X271
You have a garden. Yes.  It's the summer people typically lose weight in the summer.  It's always a challenge in the wintertime to figure out.

PATIENT X271
I don't think I've put anything on since I came back.

DOCTOR X271
Well let's see, you look good.  You really do.  

PATIENT X271
But I went out for my hike the other day and I took my 9-year-old and a 10-year-old out because I was house-sitting.  The kids, grandson sitting and his buddy and it was a great hike, about a mile by the time we got there and back but we stopped at Pizza Hut while we were out so there went the good of the walk.

DOCTOR X271
That's what.

PATIENT X271
But I only had, I had two small slices of pizza.  They ate most of the rest of it.

DOCTOR X271
Good.

PATIENT X271
So that I ate the next day is lunch.

DOCTOR X271
You know you can eat that stuff, it's all within reason.

PATIENT X271
Exactly.

DOCTOR X271
It's not terrible to eat that once.

PATIENT X271
When I was next door.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
I had this, well it's a black gentleman from the south.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
He was my roommate.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X271
And I said you know there's a couple of things we got to work on to study because we had this dietician who was like if you drink one glass of whole milk you'll probably die before breakfast and I said yeah I'm one of these guys that believes in moderation and he said well you ought to be from the south and I said guess where my parents live.  They live in xxx xxx, xxxiana and he says holy shit but long story short, we invented 95% fat free milk.  We were going to sell that and make a fortune.

DOCTOR X271
Really.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.  Do you know how many little old ladies my mother-in-law would have been alive?  She would have bought that stuff @@@.  You can still @@@ glasses of the milk.  Cause you know what it is?  Just regular milk.  It's got 5% butterfat in it, that means that it's 95% fat free if my arithmetic's right.  I said we got about ten days to do this and then we gotta get out of the country.  And he told me I was dangerous and apparently made some smart-aleck comment to the nutritionist cause I got a long lecture the next time she came through.

DOCTOR X271
Oh no.  Well things are looking good okay.

PATIENT X271
Okay good.

DOCTOR X271
But I'm inclined to order that test for you.

PATIENT X271
Alright when you get that set up can we do something about the hearing?

DOCTOR X271
And I'm going to order a Audiology consult for that also.

PATIENT X271
Super.

DOCTOR X271
So what they do is um they are going to do the, you do all this special hearing tests okay.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
And then I suspect though we're probably going to have to get an MRI or a CAT scan of the brain just because whenever there's an asymmetric hearing loss.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
People worry about the worst case scenario which would be a tumor um affecting the nerves there.  Affecting the nerve on that side okay.  

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
I always tell you about worst case scenarios.

PATIENT X271
Yeah, I'll throw myself in front of a car on the way home so.  I got nothing to lose.

DOCTOR X271
I mean.

PATIENT X271
I'm being facetious, you can see I'm having a good time with this thing today because I have, I feel good.

DOCTOR X271
I'm glad to see it yeah.

PATIENT X271
You know if you can't make me feel good because of this, that and whatever else then I worry about it and I'm sitting kind of, I know what it was.  One other thing.

DOCTOR X271
Yes.

PATIENT X271
Oh what do they call it?

DOCTOR X271
Oh and the shoulder also, um that.

PATIENT X271
That one I got to work on.

DOCTOR X271
That sounds like muscle and tendinitis.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
Um I think ibuprofen is good okay.

PATIENT X271
Uh ibuprofen and Keflex.

DOCTOR X271
Uh Keflex is an antibiotic.  Do you take it?

PATIENT X271
Then I'm not talking about Keflex then.  Plavix.

DOCTOR X271
Plavix.

PATIENT X271
Plavix yeah.

DOCTOR X271
There might, okay they worry about increased risks of bleeding, specifically in the GI tract.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
If you take your ibuprofen with food.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
And you don't take a lot of it, then it should be okay.  You know another option is Tylenol Arthritis that you can try too.  It's not as good as ibuprofen or Naproxen or meloxicam.

PATIENT X271
Well the big thing I was concerned was on my way out we were having a little chat about the do's and don'ts of being on Plavix and they said use the Tylenol or acetaminophen instead.

DOCTOR X271
Have you tried it for the pain for the shoulder?

PATIENT X271
Uh I got a bottle accidentally of Tylenol P.M.  It was about a week before my daughter said you know P.M. and I said @@@ you get P.M., its PMS you get and she says no look at it and I looked at it and said um I wondered why they were blue and grey pills but I.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah and that's not the color of Tylenol.

PATIENT X271
No uh yeah it helped at night sleeping cause that's when I and again when I.  

DOCTOR X271
Lift up.

PATIENT X271
How do I get @@@ pain in the butt line so I go outside and I open the car door, I get in and then I reach out and have to stretch to get the car door and then pull to pull it closed, oh man so.

DOCTOR X271
Let's try and you never injured yourself right?

PATIENT X271
I have not injured my shoulder no.

DOCTOR X271
All of a sudden this showed up right?  This is all of a sudden right?

PATIENT X271
Yeah it's just been maybe as I say a month that it came on.

DOCTOR X271
And you weren't doing something strenuous to bring it on?  I might get an x-ray too.  I don't think it's in the bone.  I'm pretty sure it's in the muscle or the tendon okay.  Um and then physical therapy is another option too, to go over exercises to stretch those muscles out.

PATIENT X271
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X271
I can certainly order that for you, if you don't mind coming in here once the car is fixed.

PATIENT X271
Well how often do I need to come in here for that?  You see we live 100 mile round trip.

DOCTOR X271
I know you're over in @@@ right?

PATIENT X271
Yeah.  Uh let's just take the medicine and see if it helps a little bit.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.

PATIENT X271
I.

DOCTOR X271
You want, Tylenol you said helped it right?

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
Let's stick with the Tylenol.

PATIENT X271
I also take 325 mg of aspirin a day.

DOCTOR X271
That helps too.  That's an NSAID too that should help.  So let's do that.  If it's not getting better and there's an issue then we're going to do physical therapy okay.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
Just to make sure, by that time you're going to be more inclined to do something more aggressive then okay cause it was bothering you more.  Okay and then we need to order a couple other things and then I have to check in with my boss here in the clinic, my attending and I'll be right back okay.  Um but your labs look great.

PATIENT X271
Magnesium is it in line, is it a little low?

DOCTOR X271
It is perfect, yours was 1.8, but let me double check that.  Yeah 1.8.  They put you on pills right?

PATIENT X271
Yeah I take 400 mg a day.

DOCTOR X271
That should be fine; 1.8 is fine.  If you have like heart arrhythmia, I would probably want you above 2 but I'm quite happy with where it is now.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
Alright.  (Someone comes to the door and the doctor speaks with them)

PATIENT X271
I have one more question.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X271
Um probiotics, a little pill full.

DOCTOR X271
I know about the @@@.  I work with researchers on this one here at xxx actually so @@@.

PATIENT X271
My wife and my grandson or my daughter and my grandson are taking these things and I said no I can't at first, I don't think.

DOCTOR X271
It doesn't hurt usually.

PATIENT X271
Okay.  Cause it did say there on the back if you're taking any other prescription meds check with your doctor so.

DOCTOR X271
No it won't hurt and if you're buying these like in yogurt and over-the-counter and stuff like that.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
Unfortunately they're usually all the bugs they put in there are usually all dead.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
Just to let you know.  There's very few that are actually truly regulating.

PATIENT X271
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X271
And very few that actually truly help and usually people mostly take probiotics for C. diff infection, which you have absolutely nothing to worry about with that.

PATIENT X271
I'm not going to do it, believe any of that. 

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
They're on this diet and I'm the all American diet yeah.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah I don't think it adds anything to your heart either and if anything, honestly I think its expensive yogurt with dead bugs.

PATIENT X271
But we can @@@ down foods which is in xxx and not that far from the house.

DOCTOR X271
If you want, I think all food's really expensive.

PATIENT X271
No it is but my daughter loves it and I just usually say great, when you go over there you're gonna end up picking up the tab and she'll say yeah let's go.

DOCTOR X271
Well if she's gonna pay for it.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
I'll be gone just a second okay.

PATIENT X271
I'm here.  I'm here.

DOCTOR X271
I'll be five minutes okay.

PATIENT X271
Sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  79:35  DOCTOR IN:  85:25)

DOCTOR X271
Ok let me put in the order and right before you go.  We're gonna do everything like we discussed so okay.  So we'll get you an ultrasound.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
You're gonna go to the ear doctor.  We don't need any imaging for this unless it gets bad and then you give me a call.

PATIENT X271
I'll do that.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.  Um and then I think that's it right?

PATIENT X271
Blood sugar.

DOCTOR X271
The blood sugar was fine, you're not diabetic.  6.3 is the hemoglobin A1c that was checked today and it stayed there.  When it becomes 6.5.

PATIENT X271
I'm diabetic.  Well I'm going to have to come a little less weight and I got up about a week and a half ago in the night.  I get up at 6 in the morning and I go down and about every other day or every third day I take my blood sugar.  It was 104, where the hell that come from you know.  I had a piece of cake after supper last night, I was at 104 and it's been 104, 105, I get 120 and it went back down to 104 the next day, this last week cause I took every day this week.  But it's floating along at 105 and I know that's chemically induced but um I need to stay on the medication I'm on.

DOCTOR X271
Right.  But you're just on metformin.  If you were like on insulin we could titrate that stuff down but you're just on metformin.  If you get low blood sugar give me a call.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
That's like less than 80s and if you get episodes or you're symptomatic.

PATIENT X271
Metformin is the only drug I have that is for diabetes?

DOCTOR X271
Yeah.

PATIENT X271
That I just. @@@.

DOCTOR X271
Oh you're on glipizide too aren't you?

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
Okay um 104 is pretty good, that's first thing in the morning right?

PATIENT X271
Right.

DOCTOR X271
Fasting.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.

DOCTOR X271
That's pretty good.  If you're ever less than 80s give me a call and we're stopping glipizide and be just on this one.

PATIENT X271
Okay.

DOCTOR X271
Okay.  So actually that's your goal, to come off of the glipizide.  But everything looks good.  If you lose weight this summer, I guarantee we'll stop the glipizide @@@.

PATIENT X271
Yeah I if I take it off then we'll dump this that and whatever else and get Lipitor on, whatever the long chemical name is for generic Lipitor.

DOCTOR X271
Simvastatin.

PATIENT X271
The uh, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR X271
It is simvastatin.

PATIENT X271
That's what I'm on right now.  Is that.

DOCTOR X271
I don't remember if that's Lipitor, I only go with generics, I actually don't remember.

PATIENT X271
Uh DOCTOR said he was looking at Crestor.

DOCTOR X271
He did mention that.

PATIENT X271
And then I never heard a word back on that uh you guys don't handle it here but that's alright because you don't handle Plavix here.  You hand blood @@@ or whatever it is.

DOCTOR X271
Clopidogrel. 

PATIENT X271
Huh?

DOCTOR X271
Clopidogrel.

PATIENT X271
Yeah.  Except that it comes in a bottle that says Plavix and when I asked the Walgreens pharmacist he says there is no generic out for Plavix, it came out and it was pulled off the market.  Well you guys apparently decided you're gonna do it so you're giving me Plavix, I said that here, I'll deny it if ever goes out there in a discussion because it's making me work and I like it.

DOCTOR X271
Yeah but hold on just a second real quick.

PATIENT X271
Sure.  I'll show it to.

DOCTOR X271
Alright these things are sent and we'll see you in a couple months.  We'll check labs again just like today, alright?.  Here you go sir.

PATIENT X271
Is everything in order?

DOCTOR X271
Yep, nice to seeing you doing so well.

PATIENT X271
Great to feel the way I have today although I kind of got rid of trying @@@.

DOCTOR X271
@@@.  Oh you're dilated.

PATIENT X271
@@@.

DOCTOR X271
Take care okay.

PATIENT X271
Okay and I just go right over here.

DOCTOR X271
@@@ uh-huh.

No @@@ but I was.

DOCTOR X721
Were you having fevers before?

PATIENT X721
Yeah first two days.

DOCTOR X721
Did you measure it; was your temperature actually high?

PATIENT X721
It wasn't high but it was at just borderline.

DOCTOR X721

PATIENT X721
It was uh 100 or something.

DOCTOR X721
Your blood pressure or your temperature?

PATIENT X721
You said my temperature right?

DOCTOR X721
Yeah 100 over something?

PATIENT X721
No, no, that was my blood pressure.  I forgot what my temperature was.

DOCTOR X721
Okay but no fevers or chills right now um any shortness of breath?

PATIENT X721
No.

DOCTOR X721
No you just said when you cough you get a little dizzy.

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Does that go away after you stop coughing?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.

PATIENT X721
It hurts when I cough too.  My head hurts.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah.  Is anyone at home sick?

PATIENT X721
No I'm the only person staying in my place.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Does this feel like its getting better or it's been about the same?

PATIENT X721
I think it's getting a little better.  It's better than the first two days you know, I was taking Alka-Seltzer Plus.

DOCTOR X721
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X721
And I had some cough syrup that I had from the last visit.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah did that help?

PATIENT X721
Yeah it helped.

DOCTOR X721
So it's mostly the cough and then when you cough you're getting a little bit of a headache.

PATIENT X721
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X721
Um going on for like seven days.  No fevers at all, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that.

PATIENT X721
No, chest pains yes.

DOCTOR X721
With the cough?

PATIENT X721
Yeah with the cough but before I got sick this whole left side from the arm got real stiff and this sharp pain went all the way up to the shoulder where I couldn't even lift my shoulder.

DOCTOR X721
Okay are you still having that?

PATIENT X721
Yeah in both shoulders now.

DOCTOR X721
Just shoulder pain?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Okay so where, it's just pain it's just right here?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Let me see something.  How bad is the shoulder pain on a scale from 1-10?

PATIENT X721
7.

DOCTOR X721
But it's in both shoulders?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.  And at times both my hands stiffen up a lot.

DOCTOR X721
Uh-huh.  Did you hurt your shoulders at all?  Have you been doing any heavy lifting at all?  What do you do for work?  Do you work?

PATIENT X721
No I was in a car accident in 2006 that left me in a coma.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.

PATIENT X721
And then I got screws and @@@ in both of my ankles.

DOCTOR X721
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X721
And uh @@@.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  But with the shoulders, were those hurt in the accident too?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Have those hurt ever since the accident?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Is this different?  And how long has it been worse for?

PATIENT X721
It comes and goes.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  But no new injury or anything?

PATIENT X721
No.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.

PATIENT X721
I notice I can't even do an arm curl with the curl bar because right along there it's like it hurts real bad so can't do that and even when I, when I start and I cut down on a lot of the heavy weights, I'm not doing heavy lifting but when I try to do push-ups it hurts.

DOCTOR X721
In your shoulder or it hurts right here?

PATIENT X721
It hurts in the shoulders.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Well I mean maybe you've got some arthritis in the shoulder or maybe there's something else.  We could probably just; we could try imaging you know we could get some x-rays to see if there's anything going on in there um let me see.  Otherwise so you are 53.  Are you a smoker?

PATIENT X721
No.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Have you ever been?

PATIENT X721
Nope.

DOCTOR X721
Excellent.  Um did you get your flu shot this year?  Do you want to get it today?

PATIENT X721
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X721
Okay any reason?

PATIENT X721
No I'm not taking shots.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.

PATIENT X721
Really I don't like needles.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.

PATIENT X721
I keep forgetting to bring my medical records here from Rush, that's where I was going when I was in a car accident.

DOCTOR X721
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X721
And then I was in the hospital for at least two months.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah, that'd be useful to have here um, let me see, otherwise you're 53.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X721
What is that?

DOCTOR X721
They put a camera up your bottom.

PATIENT X721
Yeah they did that um about two years ago.

DOCTOR X721
Okay I'll go take a look, 2010.  Okay it looks like you need another one next year.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Okay and they saw the last time DOCTOR referred you to our MOVE Program for some weight loss, did you ever see them?  What do you think?

PATIENT X721
It was great.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Are you still going there?

PATIENT X721
No that was, that was for about a couple of weeks so I finished that program.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  They gave some good pointers and things.

PATIENT X721
Yeah cause I lost a lot of weight.

DOCTOR X721
Oh good.  How much weight have you lost, let's take a look.

PATIENT X721
I was 316 when I entered the program, right now I'm 288.

DOCTOR X721
Awesome.  Okay.  You want to sit up here for me?  Now when you cough and you get this mucous up does it feel better when you get it up?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.  I been swallowing much better once it comes up.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  But did they recently give you like a cough syrup or something that'll help break that stuff up.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X721
A lot of times when people have symptoms like this it's just a viral kind of infection where antibiotics don't really work.  You know viral infections, usually there's a lot of those going around right now, you know the weather the way it is.

PATIENT X721
Yes.

DOCTOR X721
Um they usually will last like 10 to 14 days and you kind of just let it run its course I mean it's not anything to treat really.  We can get you some cough syrup and things like that to kind of help with the symptoms.

PATIENT X721
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X721
There's nothing we can really, you know we don't really need to treat anything so it'll go away on its own.  Um.

PATIENT X721
I got another question.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah.

PATIENT X721
I think I know how I caught it.  I have family members that smoke and when I go over to their house it's like damn.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.

PATIENT X721
Like I be sneezing you know man, all the smoking and mixing.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah.

PATIENT X721
My throat gets all scratchy.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah that's from the smoking.

PATIENT X721
Yeah cause every time I get sick the next day I know.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah I mean a lot of people will kind of get like a small bronchitis you know cause smoke irritates your lungs.

PATIENT X721
It do, it really irritates me so I'm gonna stay from over there.

DOCTOR X721
Yeah.  Stick your tongue out for me.  Say ah.

PATIENT X721
Ah.

DOCTOR X721
Okay good.  Yeah that @@@ at home.

PATIENT X721
@@@ right here it @@@.

DOCTOR X721
Your ear how long has that been going on for?

PATIENT X721
For a couple of months.

DOCTOR X721
Couple of months okay.  Did you ever have your hearing checked?

PATIENT X721
No.

DOCTOR X721
Okay, alright let me take a listen here.  Just breathe normally.  Okay deep breaths in and out through your mouth.  Okay great let me just listen.  Okay any pain down here anywhere?

PATIENT X721
No.

DOCTOR X721
Okay any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X721
Just the ankles.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Is that normal for you?

PATIENT X721
Because the shoes @@@.

DOCTOR X721
Right, right, okay.  Let me take a look at this one here.  Okay now the shoulders, put your arms up like this for me, keep them up, keep them up, keep them up, does that hurt?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Okay put them out in front of you.  Okay, put them out to the side, up above your head, okay.  So I mean that's, the fact is you've got a pretty good range of motion of the shoulders is a good sign.  I don't think there's any kind of serious injury or anything.  Um I think we could just get some x-rays.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X721
Just to see.  There might be some arthritis or something there um.  It doesn't seem like that bothers you too much with the moving around right?  It looked like you were doing okay with that.

PATIENT X721
Right.

DOCTOR X721
Um so maybe we'll do some x-rays and we'll see how those look okay.

PATIENT X721
Okay.

DOCTOR X721
Alright I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR so I'll be back okay.

PATIENT X721
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:28  DOCTOR IN:  47:17)

DOCTOR X721
Okay so a couple of things.  So I talked to DOCTOR and we were talking about the shoulders.  We don't think it's anything serious.  I think we could probably go without the x-ray; I want to talk to you about this and see what you think.  So I think that any time you get any kind of x-ray or CT scan you're getting radiation right.  Based on your exam, it's nothing serious.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X721
And that, at the worst, maybe there's some arthritis but just based on the ability, your strength and your range of motion it's nothing serious.  I think we could go without the x-rays just to spare you the radiation cause you know how @@@ down the line.  In terms of the cough, I'm gonna give you something called guaifenesin, kind of like Mucinex; it helps you bring up this gunk.  I don't think we need to, I think it should get better over the next couple of days.  It sounds like it already is getting better.  The smoke, being around the smokers is probably you know, as you've noticed, is probably contributing to the @@@.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X721
So I would try to stay out of that as much as you can.  I'll write you a prescription unless do you have the cough syrup at home still?

PATIENT X721
No I ran out.

DOCTOR X721
So we'll get you some here.  Do you want to pick it up at the window?

PATIENT X721
Yeah.

DOCTOR X721
Okay and then um other than that I mean your labs were last checked just in November so I don't think you need to come back and so, unless something comes up, until November.

PATIENT X721
Okay when is my next appointment?  My next appointment is in March right?

DOCTOR X721
Well we got to make it for you but your next one; you have an Endocrinology appointment in March.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X721
March 1st.  That was the one you follow up for the, you know for the testosterone and things like that.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay. 

DOCTOR X721
So that is on March 1st at 10:00 a.m. but to see us I think November is probably okay unless of course something comes up and you need to be seen sooner, we can see you sooner.

PATIENT X721
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X721
Okay.  Alright, so just stop by the Pharmacy on the way out and then return back to the clinic in nine months.  There you go.

PATIENT X721
Okay.

DOCTOR X721
Alright have a good day alright.

PATIENT X721
So give the paperwork to the people out front right?

DOCTOR X721
Yeah.  Perfect.

PATIENT X721
Thank you.

DOCTOR X721
Have a good day.

PATIENT X721
You too.

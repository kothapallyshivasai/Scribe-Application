PATIENT X294
PATIENT.  

DOCTOR X294
Hi I'm DOCTOR.  You can set this here, over here.

PATIENT X294
Okay.

DOCTOR X294
@@@ you had.

PATIENT X294
Yep.

DOCTOR X294
@@@ talk to me and @@@ everything up by me.

PATIENT X294
Okay.

DOCTOR X294
Are there any specific issues or questions that you have?  @@@.

PATIENT X294
@@@.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
Yes.  Uh I'm out of a lot of it.

DOCTOR X294
Okay I can renew them.

PATIENT X294
Uh this one, this one they gave me for my pain.

DOCTOR X294
Pain.

PATIENT X294
It's, I'm running out of that, I'm done cause I've been tripling them and stuff like that so I'm out of those now.

DOCTOR X294
Oh where do you have pain?

PATIENT X294
Uh my left hip.

DOCTOR X294
@@@.

PATIENT X294
Arthritis in my knee.

DOCTOR X294
Okay have you tried anything else like physical therapy?

PATIENT X294
Well um, I just got to the point where I'm lighter now where I can do it.  Before I was 350 pounds and it's like running around and stuff like that you know.

DOCTOR X294
Oh.

PATIENT X294
And then when summer kicks I'm going to be gone on my bike, I take off so when summer comes I'm gone.

DOCTOR X294
Okay um so you have this arthritis in your hips.

PATIENT X294
And I got my knee.  I had back surgery and I had, I guess I aggravated my sciatic nerve.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
But my foot's like numb.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
You know it doesn't have as much feeling as this one.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
But it has a little feeling.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
Alright and every once in a while that sciatic nerve hurts.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
That I think, the arthritis and that, I think that's why they gave it to me, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  I see.  Um so I just letting you know that tramadol is kind of addicting and I don't want you to take it for too long.  That's the only thing, that's why I want you to go to Physical Therapy to see if they can @@@ there.

PATIENT X294
Alright.

DOCTOR X294
To see if that will go away and is the tramadol helping you?

PATIENT X294
I don't think so.  I mean it lightens the pain a little bit but.

DOCTOR X294
I think you need something else that might be a little bit better and long-acting.

PATIENT X294
That would be nice.

DOCTOR X294
Like meloxicam, it's an NSAID, it's an anti-inflammatory drug.  Um it works on a different kind of a pain system um and I can try to give you that and see how that goes and if that doesn't help you call me and then we can change it again.

PATIENT X294
Alright.

DOCTOR X294
So let's try that because arthritis is inflammation.

PATIENT X294
Yep.

DOCTOR X294
Um and so we'll try to give you some meloxicam and see if that makes it better.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Um so you take ibuprofen and does that work?

PATIENT X294
Uh they just gave me that when I had my ear infection.

DOCTOR X294
Oh you don't need to take this, you don't take this?

PATIENT X294
I don't take that anyway.

DOCTOR X294
Oh so, you don't take it.

PATIENT X294
And I had an ear infection.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
I was here and I went down to the Ear and Throat, you know down there okay.  They said okay you look okay.  Next week it came back with a vengeance.

DOCTOR X294
Oh really, so it started coming back?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
So I got another appointment with them today.

DOCTOR X294
Oh the ENT doctors.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Okay so you're going to follow up with them?

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Why do you have so many recurrent ear infections?

PATIENT X294
Yeah that's what I'd like to know.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
Now my daughter read that I could be allergic to milk or something, have allergies.

DOCTOR X294
No.

PATIENT X294
Have allergies.

DOCTOR X294
Not in your ears, it makes you have diarrhea but not ears.

PATIENT X294
Alright.

DOCTOR X294
Not your ears okay, so.

PATIENT X294
Yep.

DOCTOR X294
So besides the arthritis and the knee pain um and the ear infection.

PATIENT X294
Back pain.

DOCTOR X294
You have back pain?

PATIENT X294
Yes.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  Um but you never went to Physical Therapy?

PATIENT X294
Uh I had it when I had my back surgery.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  I think we should give it, yeah so because what we do is first we control the pain but if that doesn't work we always recommend physical therapy.  Sometimes that can actually help a lot.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
And if that doesn't work then you think of surgery and you think of other options.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
So I want you to go through that level and if it doesn't get you to where you want it to be then we'll talk about something else.

PATIENT X294
Alright.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  Um and then you got your labs done today which was great.  Your cholesterol is excellent.

PATIENT X294
@@@.

DOCTOR X294
So good job.  I'm happy about that.  I don't have to adjust anything.  Your creatinine is a little elevated.

PATIENT X294
What is?

DOCTOR X294
The um your creatinine, or um kidney function.  Do you have kidney disease at all?

PATIENT X294
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR X294
Did you try any new medications?

PATIENT X294
Um, no.  Wait uh, well the ibuprofen I was taking that for my ear.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
Um and I just quit.  I don't like ibuprofen.  I know what they did to the guys that did them in Arizona and they would go on dialysis just because of that you know.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
So I don't take ibuprofen, I don't like it.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah so that's why.  So how long did you take the ibuprofen for, just recently?

PATIENT X294
Two, probably one or two.

DOCTOR X294
One or two, how many days?

PATIENT X294
Uh maybe three.

DOCTOR X294
Only three okay.

PATIENT X294
Yeah I didn't take it all that long you know.

DOCTOR X294
Oh okay.  Was this last week?

PATIENT X294
Yep.

DOCTOR X294
That could be the reason the creatinine bumped but, so I don't want you to take this medication okay.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Alright and so I'm

PATIENT X294
So I agree, I don't like it either.

DOCTOR X294

PATIENT X294
Now I used to be on a 10 mg of high blood pressure and then they jacked me up to 20.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah.

PATIENT X294
When I was in all that pain, but that made your blood pressure go up right, pain?

DOCTOR X294
It can.  But it looks like it's controlled with the 20.

PATIENT X294
So it's.

DOCTOR X294
I don't want to increase it.

PATIENT X294
It's staying there.

DOCTOR X294

PATIENT X294
I do have shortness of breath.  I mean.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah I know.  I'm gonna have to figure that out.  Maybe you're going to need to get pulmonary function tests to categorize why you have the shortness of breath.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Um and the wheezing only happened at night?  Did it wake you up at night?

PATIENT X294
When I lay down.  When I'm laying down yeah.

But you know.  And a lot of times I just cough real hard and I can get rid of it, it goes away.

DOCTOR X294

DOCTOR X294

PATIENT X294
You know.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  So when you told DOCTOR that it didn't work did she give you something else?

PATIENT X294

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
That makes sense, got it, got it, got it.  Okay so let's see what else we can do.  Now I see, she gave you vardenafil which is, let's just see the medication.  Okay so she gave you Levitra like you had said, @@@ that way.  So 10 mg and then you used the 20 mg and it didn't help.  That's both of them?

PATIENT X294
The half one didn't.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
Um the whole one, I don't really remember.

DOCTOR X294
You don't remember if it was?

PATIENT X294
That was a long time ago and I don't have a real good, I don't know.  She just asked me to find out something about it.

DOCTOR X294
Do you want to try that one again or not?

PATIENT X294
Um it doesn't matter.  I could try it again and if it does work well then that's great I mean.

DOCTOR X294
Once you may be getting one because it didn't stay up right?

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  So you're able to penetrate okay?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
But then it lasted only like 2 minutes?

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
Yeah it didn't last long, that's all.

DOCTOR X294
Alright so what I'm gonna do we'll order another one called Viagra and then you need to use a full pill.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
I'll give you more than that.  So that's that, we took care of that issue and then @@@.

PATIENT X294

DOCTOR X294

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  That's okay we'll figure it out.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.  So I know it wasn't cancer and I had it done the end of 2010 and I had it done in 2008 when I was locked up.

DOCTOR X294
You were locked up, what do you mean?

PATIENT X294

PATIENT X294
Yes.  Every once in a while I get a shooting pain in like my sciatic nerve.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
Where I used to get it, I know right where it's at because @@@ it's a job getting me up.  My left foot, I got I don't know maybe, you know how you stub your toe and it really hurts.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
Well if I stub any one of these toes, it don't hurt at all.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
I mean when I hit something and stub it you know and I know I kicked it I says oh, okay, that's happened I don't have to worry about it cause it don't hurt.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
But if I do it with my right foot, then I'm hopping.

DOCTOR X294
I'm going to have you continue with the tramadol, the one that you have.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Only because, I'm kind of afraid to put you on another medication because you have @@@.  You're having shortness of breath @@@.  I am going to have you check your creatinine level in like maybe a week.

PATIENT X294
Alright.

DOCTOR X294
I don't @@@.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
And if it goes down we'll have to put you on something else.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
And we'll try to figure it out that way.  And you need to lose weight and I know you have been right?

PATIENT X294
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Um are you in the MOVE Program at all?

PATIENT X294
What?

DOCTOR X294
The MOVE Program.

PATIENT X294
What's that?

DOCTOR X294
Oh you don't know about the MOVE Program?  It's this program that's for anyone that's interested in losing weight.  There's this program that is tailored to the individual and you get to work out and eat the way that they would like you too and it's pretty impressive what they do there.

PATIENT X294
They feed you?

DOCTOR X294
I don't know if they feed you, they kind of give you advice on how to go about what you should eat.

PATIENT X294
Cause a lot of time I'm cooking for myself so I eat a lot of yogurt um, I eat a lot of lunch meat.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
And I eat a lot of oatmeal.

DOCTOR X294
Oh really.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.  Instant oatmeal.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
I eat a lot of that.  I have three bowls in the morning or if I don’t have that I have eggs.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  

PATIENT X294
You know.

DOCTOR X294
But do you workout?

PATIENT X294
Um no but I ride my motor, I guess I you know I lift my motorcycle tires when I'm changing them or something like that.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  Well I think you should definitely do the MOVE Program though.  I think that might be a good way of like trying to lose weight.  I know you're doing the losing weight on your own.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
I think you would benefit.  Basically your knee pain, your back pain, all that will go away on its own.

PATIENT X294
Yeah my, my back doesn't hurt as much as it used to.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
And I can walk straighter.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
But I'm still out of breath a lot.  So I won't get up and walk a lot.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
Just cause after a little while of walking I start limping.

DOCTOR X294
So do you want to be part of the MOVE Program?

PATIENT X294
I don't know if I really have time for this.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
I have a lot of responsibilities with the club and stuff like that and they keep me pretty busy.  

DOCTOR X294
What club?

PATIENT X294
The SEALs.  Motorcycle Club.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  I've got everything down.  We talked about that.  So tell me about the shortness of breath.  So um what's going on?  When do you get short of breath?

PATIENT X294
Walking.

DOCTOR X294
Walking?  How much do you walk until you get short of breath?

PATIENT X294
Um from here to out of the building where the valet parking is.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
I'm wheezing pretty good by then.

DOCTOR X294
You're wheezing.

PATIENT X294
I'm pretty short of breath.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  And how many blocks can you walk?

PATIENT X294
Well it used to be not even a half a block and I would be, so I'm walking further now.

DOCTOR X294
Oh you are?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Since you lost weight.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  So you're walking farther since you lost weight.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
So you used to walk like maybe half a block and now you're walking at least a block?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.  I can walk over a block.  I think that's over a block.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
And sometimes it's better than others.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
I went to the bike show and I walked through that whole thing, I didn't.

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X294
I hardly hurt at all but other times it's walking half a mile to get in the place and I was really hobbling you know, it's like and my hip really, really, really hurt you know.  Okay so it seemed like maybe, my knee maybe it is getting better now.

DOCTOR X294
So um is it the pain that makes you stop or is it the shortness of breath that makes you stop walking?

PATIENT X294
Pain.

DOCTOR X294
So you can walk farther if you didn't have pain?

PATIENT X294
Probably.

DOCTOR X294
It's not the shortness of breath that's preventing you from walking.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Okay so when do you get short of breath?  Do you ever get short of breath or is it just the pain that limits you?

PATIENT X294
Um, I'll make a mental note of this.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  Alright so if you're not huffing and puffing then that means it's not the shortness of breath that limits you.

PATIENT X294
Well I'm always, I'm always, always I don't know.  I'll write this down.

DOCTOR X294
Alright.  But I'll send you for a pulmonary function test.

PATIENT X294
Okay.

DOCTOR X294
Uh but you do notice wheezing when you're walking?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
You do notice.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.  I notice when I'm laying down I wheeze.

DOCTOR X294
More than you do when you're upright.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
Okay did you sleep with extra pillows or anything?

PATIENT X294
I got a third pillow I use, yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Okay do you find that you're gonna wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air?

PATIENT X294
No.

DOCTOR X294
Do you find that even when you get the pillows or something like that is this at night when you're laying flat?

PATIENT X294
Yep.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.  And it's once or twice a week you use the inhaler?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
And it goes away.

PATIENT X294
Yeah that, I hardly use it at all.

DOCTOR X294
Okay, so I'm going to put in a consult in for the pulmonary function tests.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
To make sure that we take care of the.

PATIENT X294
Right.

DOCTOR X294
We would like to see, now you do smoke, that's a little concerning.  You've been losing weight.  Any night sweats or chills that you've noticed recently?

PATIENT X294

PATIENT X294
You know um.  I don't know.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
And then my girlfriend when she comes out, she cooks.  She is diabetic so she has to watch what she eats so I think that's where it ended up helping me because.

DOCTOR X294

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
So that's good.

PATIENT X294

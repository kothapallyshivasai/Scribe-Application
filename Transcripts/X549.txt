DOCTOR X549
PATIENT?

PATIENT X549
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah, follow me.

PATIENT X549
@@@ me.

DOCTOR X549
@@@. 

PATIENT X549
@@@.  xxx xxx xxx here.

DOCTOR X549
I'm sorry, @@@.

PATIENT X549
Oh I'm doing alright.

DOCTOR X549
@@@.

PATIENT X549
I'm sort of getting all hospitalized out, @@@ hospitals.  Research projects, University of Illinois and uh I was upstairs for two days as an inpatient just to get a spinal tap.

DOCTOR X549
Okay for what?

PATIENT X549
Okay, well I got the spinal tap, I'm out of breath just give me a second.  I got the spinal tap uh because uh my neurologist DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Uh felt it would be useful in determining and I'm speaking as a civilian non-medical person, the uh nature of my neuropathy I have uh bilateral sensory polyneuropathy.

DOCTOR X549
Hmm.

PATIENT X549
In both legs and it's crawling up to, in fact I just noticed last night, it's like pretty very close to my knees, right next to my knees, although it's not 100% that high but one of those days I've got neuropathy in the feet and legs and uh since 1998 and that is when she first diagnosed it.  Then uh I'm also worried about the fact that I have it, I'm just going to take a while just to tell you about, I've lost about 40% of the feeling in my hands, maybe more.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
And I've also got edema, I've got gout in the right wrist and I've got edema which is causing all these marks which are called @@@ disease.

DOCTOR X549
So why did they do the tap?

PATIENT X549
Well to find the nature of my neuropathy.  

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
See if they can determine uh what is causing it or whatever.  Now that was last Tuesday finally, I had a successful spinal tap.

DOCTOR X549
Alright.

PATIENT X549
The first two attempts were not good uh by DOCTOR.  He was brand new; I don't think he had done them before.  It @@@.  And then uh your doctor in Interventional Radiology with an Armenian name, he did it in Radiology Tuesday of last week.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
Um I don't want to uh, it's not fair for me to bother @@@.  Is there any remarkable comment by the uh, by the radiologist or I mean yeah by the radiologist relating to the uh?

DOCTOR X549
Done here?

PATIENT X549
Yeah, it's the spinal tap here in Radiology.  I'm just curious if there's anything that stands out as a result of that spinal tap or whatever, the lumbar or whatever it is.

DOCTOR X549
When was it?

PATIENT X549
It was last Tuesday, let's see today is what like the 29th?

DOCTOR X549
Hmm.

PATIENT X549
So it would have been the 20, am I right in saying yeah the 22nd, 22nd of September.

DOCTOR X549
And the culture was negative.

PATIENT X549
The culture was negative?

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
For anything disastrous.  @@@ as they say.  Nothing relating to Agent Orange or dioxin or anything of that sort I'm sure.  I think dioxin @@@ so I understand that it can only be found to @@@ blood flow.

DOCTOR X549
From what I can find here, so far it just a negative.  This one is saying that it's pending.

PATIENT X549
Oh still pending okay.  Now I'll mention one other important thing that's happened just recently.  In fact Friday um now, when I was in the hospital for the spinal tap they gave me blood tests for other miscellaneous things here.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
Um and then I got a call last Friday from your, I don't know the exactly you know the TeleNurse or whatever it is.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Telephone Nurse, whatever that is.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
And she said I'm calling about your high blood pressure and your diabetes okay.  Now I've never been formerly diagnosed by any doctor with diabetes okay.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Um now, I did have a high glucose level about six, you know six or eight weeks ago here okay.  Very high, it was like after I'd eaten a lot of cherries you know okay.

DOCTOR X549
How high?

PATIENT X549
It was like 175 I believe.

DOCTOR X549
After eating?

PATIENT X549
After eating a lot of sweet cherries.

DOCTOR X549
That's high.

PATIENT X549
Okay.  Now the point is, was something down.

DOCTOR X549
I think we should check it.

PATIENT X549
Uh 10 days ago or there about, not eight days ago, from the blood tests that were taken relating to uh would I have been recently diagnosed by anybody with having diabetes?

DOCTOR X549
As far as I can find here no.  So I don't know who called you or why or.

PATIENT X549
Well it was the nurse.  It was the Tele whatever it is and that's what she thinks.

DOCTOR X549
From here, from the VA?

PATIENT X549
From the VA here and uh they call after a patient has been an inpatient you know.

DOCTOR X549
Everything's fine.

PATIENT X549
And I said is this formal notification that I've been diagnosed with diabetes and she said no and she wanted to get off the telephone quickly.  She didn't want to deal with the problem you know.

DOCTOR X549
Did you end up getting the follow-up colonoscopy?

PATIENT X549
Uh I had a colonoscopy roughly, I'm gonna say you know, seven or eight months ago okay.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
I had at least 13 polyps taken out.  I'm like a polyp farm you know.  I had like 13 polyps taken out.  Now uh in two previous colonoscopies and let's just say the last three years, in two that were six months apart I had lots of polyps taken out.  I'm gonna say um you know 13 or 14 or something on that order and the thing that sort of worries me is that my next follow-up colonoscopy is not for three years from the date of the last one okay, which would have been.

DOCTOR X549
Who told you that?

PATIENT X549
That's the letter that I got from the GI Clinic that said it would be three years okay.  Now they said if I have any questions call the clinic and the recording said someone will get back to me within a day and a half or two days or something.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
No one ever got back to me um and uh the reason I called is because if they're taking out you know two dozen polyps over a short period of time pretty much, the question becomes should I wait three years for the next colonoscopy?

DOCTOR X549
Yes.  Yes.

PATIENT X549
Well the reason, the only reason I say that is because um when 2 1/2, 3 years ago when I had a colonoscopy and they took a lot of them out.  I forget the exact number.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
It might have been seven or six or something I called and talked with a GI doctor.  At that time I was successful in talking with the GI doctor after the polyps were taken out and I said my next colonoscopy isn't planned for several years, you know based on how many polyps they've taken out in the last two times uh should I wait that long.  He said you know you're right, you should not wait several years you should have one soon, which I had; I'm just going to guestimate about one year later or less.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Okay.  Um so you know I'm willing to go along with whatever you think.

DOCTOR X549
Uh.

PATIENT X549
But just keep in mind, the last time 13 polyps.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
You know.  I'm just so, they're thinking even if I get a lot of polyps, they're not gonna be necessarily cancerous within three years but the odds are fairly low, that's probably what they're saying.

DOCTOR X549
Um well the uh it always depends on the pathology.

PATIENT X549
Okay.

DOCTOR X549
Um if any more than.

PATIENT X549
There's one flat polyp recently that whatever, you know I don't know the technical names.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Well there was one flat polyp which I understand are more dangerous.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT X549
There was one, the last one what are they called plastic polyps or something?

DOCTOR X549
Hyperplastic

PATIENT X549
Whatever they are yeah.

DOCTOR X549
So when was the last gout flare you had?

PATIENT X549
Oh yeah well, depending on whatever your definition is, I three or four or five times I've felt a gout flare-up starting on my right wrist which it was diagnosed about a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
I had two flare-ups then.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
But I had.

DOCTOR X549
Are you taking anything?

PATIENT X549
Kind of like swell ups but and it actually sort of went into gout probably.

DOCTOR X549
Are you taking allopurinol or?

PATIENT X549
I sure am, every other day.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
But uh I haven't had a long, I had actually weeks, I've had a couple of instances of not being really able to lift things with my right arm because of the gout but it didn't last, it only lasts a week or so.

DOCTOR X549
Are you still taking the Coumadin or are you on aspirin?

PATIENT X549
No I'm on aspirin therapy.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
I was on Coumadin for several years for a fib.

DOCTOR X549
So why did they stop the Coumadin?

PATIENT X549
Well I lost, believe it or not, when I had my left toe and the first ray of my foot amputated December 7th, following that I've lost, believe it or not, at least four and maybe five pints of blood which were replaced both here in this hospital and at St. xxx xxx where I was brought, the same within 12 hours after I went to the nursing home.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
I was taken to St. xxx xxx from the nursing home, I lost several pints of blood and I was given several pints of blood at St. xxx xxx and everything.  Uh I was given blood here, maybe one or two pints that I lost through the toe.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT X549
That had been amputated so uh the podiatrist left me on the Coumadin while I had the surgery.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
I think probably because they feel they can tie off the foot so that it won't bleed during surgery.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah but.

PATIENT X549
So I'm not sure they were thinking too much about post surgery.

DOCTOR X549
Uh are you still cathing yourself?

PATIENT X549
Yes.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
Eight to ten times a day.  I've probably done it 20,000 times, literally 20,000 times.

DOCTOR X549
Do you get a new one still?

PATIENT X549
Uh every six months or so.

DOCTOR X549
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X549
I still have an atonic bladder.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
That's the main reason and also noted @@@.

DOCTOR X549
And you're still taking your vitamin B12 supplement?

PATIENT X549
Yes I'm due in fact to take it tomorrow, uh the B12.  I shoot the B12 with whatever you call it.

DOCTOR X549
Okay and then you're still seeing the kidney doctors?

PATIENT X549
The what doctors?

DOCTOR X549
Kidney.

PATIENT X549
Um I have an appointment for November 1st, I'm gonna try to get in even sooner.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
Uh just to check the status of my uh.

DOCTOR X549
So you're taking Tylenol, allopurinol, amlodipine uh aspirin, uh @@@.

PATIENT X549
What's the last one you said?

DOCTOR X549
@@@.

PATIENT X549
@@@.

DOCTOR X549
For your @@@.

PATIENT X549
Oh yes by the way does it show, does that is still active as far as you can see that?

DOCTOR X549
Yeah.

PATIENT X549
Or you know.

DOCTOR X549
The diltiazem.

PATIENT X549
I take that every other day.

DOCTOR X549
Diltiazem.

PATIENT X549
Yes.

DOCTOR X549
Finasteride, enalapril?

PATIENT X549
Yep, yep.

DOCTOR X549
Folic acid?

PATIENT X549
Yep.

DOCTOR X549
Lasix, the furosemide.

PATIENT X549
Yep.

DOCTOR X549
Do you do 1 1/2 tablets twice a day?

PATIENT X549
That's correct.

DOCTOR X549
Um gabapentin?

PATIENT X549
Yes uh yes.

DOCTOR X549
@@@.

PATIENT X549
Uh yes, it's very odd.  As you can see, in fact I even quit that for quite a while off and on because it makes me fall asleep during the day so DOCTOR said well just try to take it when you go to sleep.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
When you're trying to get to sleep.

DOCTOR X549
Um lisinopril?

PATIENT X549
Yes.

DOCTOR X549
Half a tablet.

PATIENT X549
Half a tablet twice a day.

DOCTOR X549
And metoprolol?

PATIENT X549
Yes two.

DOCTOR X549
Twice a day.

PATIENT X549
Two tablets, one tablet twice a day.

DOCTOR X549
Yes.  Uh and then the thiamine.

PATIENT X549
Yes.

DOCTOR X549
Anything else?

PATIENT X549
Those are, that's.

DOCTOR X549
That's the list.

PATIENT X549
You've got the, what was that?

DOCTOR X549
That's pretty much it?

PATIENT X549
Yeah that's pretty much it yeah.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.  So.

PATIENT X549
So uh so you didn't glance at anything uh I probably, part of the reason I want to take this boot off, I'd be happy to.

DOCTOR X549
Pretty swollen.

PATIENT X549
Oh yeah that's been the big problem.  

DOCTOR X549
The swelling?

PATIENT X549
My uh you know a couple of months ago I was sent by Podiatry to a local prosthetics place.  They gave me a diabetic shoe to be fitted because I have ulcers.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
And they're now very close to being healed.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
But what's stopping the healing or hurting me is the what do you call the edema.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Which I had, in fact the very day, the very day I was headed to the prosthetics place near my home.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Uh my feet and legs swell up.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
With edema and you know I'm coming on to my non-medical opinion.

DOCTOR X549
Deep breath for me okay.

PATIENT X549
Yep.

DOCTOR X549
Deep breaths.  Any fever, chills, nausea, chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X549
Uh I, every three months, including about two weeks ago I had uh, I had uh chills.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
And uh.

DOCTOR X549
@@@.

PATIENT X549
What felt like and I had a small fever.  It's every three months or so I get that and it lasts usually you know about eight or ten hours overnight and then it goes away. I always suspected in my non-medical way that it has something to do with my kidney disease which I have.  At one time I just, maybe stage five kidney disease and then they got my blood pressure under control and I went back to stage three.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Now it's probably lingering around stage four.

DOCTOR X549
Any uh vomiting, diarrhea?

PATIENT X549
Uh no I'm pretty good.

DOCTOR X549
Any blood in your stool?

PATIENT X549
No except its blood, I was diagnosed here and when I had the colonoscopy as internal hemorrhoids of the anus.

DOCTOR X549
Um do you need refills of your medications today?

PATIENT X549
Uh the only thing, I'm going to be going over there, I don't think you would have to worry about this.  Uh except to say one thing, I'm going over, there's a lady who takes care of catheters.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
I can't remember her name.  She has a real odd name uh I'll be seeing her today to get a renewal.  As long as I have a renewal, I'd like renewals left on my catheters that you might be able to notice there and on my lube gel, the gel that is used with catheters.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
Did you notice?  That's the one thing I'm concerned about.

DOCTOR X549
You have six refills on the lubricant jelly.

PATIENT X549
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X549
And then 11 refills.

PATIENT X549
On catheters?

DOCTOR X549
10 refills.

PATIENT X549
Oh that's good.  Now there's only one other quick thing.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
A doctor, I'm trying to remember, oh you know what it was he was a hematologist.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
And I was discussing briefly with him about three weeks ago, thereabouts roughly, uh the uh diabetes.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
And uh.

DOCTOR X549
You don't have any.

PATIENT X549
Well apparently not.

DOCTOR X549
No.

PATIENT X549
Okay uh by the way can I bother, do you recall what my glucose was, I assume they took my glucose like 10 days ago when I was here in the hospital for the spinal tap?

DOCTOR X549
The last glucose was 82.

PATIENT X549
82?  About ten days ago or something like that?

DOCTOR X549
On the 21st.

PATIENT X549
No, did you say the 21st, yeah.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah.

PATIENT X549
No kidding?

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Well that's great right.

DOCTOR X549
No you're good.  Your kidneys are looking good, everything is.

PATIENT X549
Well my kidneys, believe first of all my left kidney I was told two years ago is dead.  It's atrophied and now other doctors have said well maybe it's not quite dead but it's near its.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah but you don't have diabetes though.

PATIENT X549
Oh yeah well that's the best news I've had all day.  I was just gonna ask one question.

DOCTOR X549
Yes.

PATIENT X549
Remember I said like the hematologist.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Hematologist I got on the subject of diabetes.  He said the next time you have a blood test; it would be good to have what you call the A.

DOCTOR X549
A1c.

PATIENT X549
I think it was an A1c.

DOCTOR X549
You had it last year.

PATIENT X549
I had one last year.

DOCTOR X549
In May and it was fine.

PATIENT X549
It was okay.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah.

PATIENT X549
Oh do you have 5.9 or something like that yeah okay so and plus what you're telling me about the 21st is good news.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah.

PATIENT X549
So I don't.

DOCTOR X549
They checked your sugars and they were all fine.

PATIENT X549
Yeah he said the next time I had blood tests to get an A1c but that was before the good news that you just told me about that.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah.

PATIENT X549
Yeah.

DOCTOR X549
No your sugars look fine.  I doubt that much would be new.

PATIENT X549
Yeah.  Now I'll be seeing the Renal on November 1st.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
I'll be seeing, I'll be getting the results of the spinal tap.  I'm going to make an appointment for an EMG.  I think it's for getting the results of the spinal tap.

DOCTOR X549
Okay I'll be right back.

PATIENT X549
Okay.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:53  DOCTOR IN:  53:31)

DOCTOR X549
Um when do you follow up with Neurology again?

PATIENT X549
I do not, I'm about to make an appointment in the next 20 minutes.  I believe they're working the floors right now in the hospital.

DOCTOR X549
You don't need any refills or you do?

PATIENT X549
I don't believe I need refills but the only thing I would ask of you is she, you know I probably won't be back here until you tell me, it's three, four, five, six months.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.  

PATIENT X549
Now if that's the case do you see anything on there?  Is it difficult for you to decide if uh let's say I need additional what do you call it, um you know, additional refills on especially for instance blood pressure medication?

DOCTOR X549
Um.

PATIENT X549
Is it hard to make that out?  I'm gonna take a wild guess and say it's gonna be closer to six months that I probably would not be back here unless you indicate differently.

DOCTOR X549
Um I was going to say four months.

PATIENT X549
Uh-huh sure that would be great uh.

DOCTOR X549
Um let's see.

PATIENT X549
Something's always coming up.

DOCTOR X549
Um.

PATIENT X549
As long as I've got enough to get me through, let's say four months.  If it seems like I do terrific but.

DOCTOR X549
You can always call.

PATIENT X549
Yeah that's, yeah.  That can be a little problematical but that's okay.

DOCTOR X549
Um.

PATIENT X549
Yeah.

DOCTOR X549
For your swelling, for the next three days.

PATIENT X549
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X549
Instead of doing 1 1/2 of the furosemide.

PATIENT X549
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X549
Just do the full two tablets.

PATIENT X549
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT X549
Okay.

DOCTOR X549
For three days only.

PATIENT X549
Yeah.

DOCTOR X549
Starting tomorrow.

PATIENT X549
I suspect.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
That they, you know, by the way I'm like it's always difficult to tell with me when I have active @@@ which I've had in the past.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Um uh and so what I'm trying to get at is you know a lot of the swelling might have been, started with you know active @@@ fluid or something which they indicated.

DOCTOR X549
@@@.

PATIENT X549
In the last few months.

DOCTOR X549
It's hard to say that it's that or if your kidneys or if it's.

PATIENT X549
Yeah, right, exactly.  However, uh my suspicion based upon only, my non-medical suspicion.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
Non-medically trained suspicion is that uh you know I read an article recently that said you know uh edema is sometimes caused by inactivity and in my particular case you know the podiatrist you know uh seemed happiest when I simply had my feet up and I'm not really getting, because I had ulcers on the toes you know the remaining toes that I have.

DOCTOR X549
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X549
And uh they're happiest when I'm not doing a lot of walking.  So that's what I suspect is a large part of the problem.

DOCTOR X549
@@@.

PATIENT X549
So I'll be seeing them very soon, I have two appointments to make today.  One is with the uh.

DOCTOR X549
The foot doctor.

PATIENT X549
Is the foot doctor and one is with.

DOCTOR X549
Neurologist.

PATIENT X549
Neurologist yes.

DOCTOR X549
Good yeah so I mean so far @@@.

PATIENT X549
But you don't think I should wait three years to follow up with the colonoscopy?

DOCTOR X549
Well we can talk next time, you're still not due.

PATIENT X549
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X549
You just had one.

PATIENT X549
Alright.

DOCTOR X549
So.

PATIENT X549
Okay.  I'm uh.

DOCTOR X549
Right now you're good.

PATIENT X549
Yeah I'm just a little worried.  My father died of colon cancer and my mother cerebral so.

DOCTOR X549
Okay, next time you come we can go over the whole @@@.

PATIENT X549
Yeah.

DOCTOR X549
@@@ what they found.

PATIENT X549
Well I may, what I've been really putting off is that I may call the GI doctors.

DOCTOR X549
Hmm.

PATIENT X549
Again and just see.

DOCTOR X549
See what they say.

PATIENT X549
And just reset that one.

DOCTOR X549
Yeah.

PATIENT X549
Alright so uh.

DOCTOR X549
But you're doing good, you're doing good.

PATIENT X549
Oh that's right.

DOCTOR X549
Um depending what they find on the results of the lumbar puncture.

PATIENT X549
Yeah.

DOCTOR X549
Then you know I'm guessing you'll see Neurology by that time and they can see if there's anything you need for the different @@@.

PATIENT X549
Yeah, yeah.  My overall and key thing right now is my kidneys you know and.

DOCTOR X549
And @@@.

PATIENT X549
And maybe I'm gonna need dialysis.

DOCTOR X549
Dialysis, very true.

PATIENT X549
Okay.

DOCTOR X549
Have a great day okay.

PATIENT X549
Thank you for putting up with me, I appreciate it.

DOCTOR X549
No problem.

PATIENT X549
Okay.

DOCTOR X549
Okay.

PATIENT LEAVES:  58:43.

PATIENT X627
Um well I know @@@ cause you cut me down on my medication.  You what I'm saying you gonna cut back.  You know get off that TB stuff.  That's what's probably messing with my liver.  But ain't never had no problem with until I started taking that.

DOCTOR X627
Well you know that's probably right.

PATIENT X627
For the kidney, whatever.  I wouldn't had no problem I would keep on my medications.

DOCTOR X627
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X627
Until I started taking that what @@@ she told me that it mixed with my @@@ and stuff.

DOCTOR X627
But let me see if what you're taking that would affect the kidneys and we're monitoring your liver.

PATIENT X627
Right.

DOCTOR X627
And your liver is doing okay so far.

PATIENT X627
Okay.

DOCTOR X627
And you're not gonna take it for the rest of your life, it's only for nine months and you're almost half, @@@.

PATIENT X627
Hope, hope.

DOCTOR X627
So you have another four or five.

PATIENT X627
Right.

DOCTOR X627
You're done after that.  You don't take that, so we @@@ tuberculosis.  Uh that's one thing.  The other thing is I, you're in pain.

PATIENT X627
Yeah.

DOCTOR X627
And the medications have side effects so.

PATIENT X627
The liver's alright well.

DOCTOR X627
Well I mean if, if I give @@@ pain every day well of course you're gonna do it.

PATIENT X627
But it's alright.

DOCTOR X627
But that's not the answer because it kills all the other organs in your body but um I'm trying to remember, have you ever been seen in the Pain Clinic?

PATIENT X627
No, I tried a check-up at the Pain Clinic.

DOCTOR X627

PATIENT X627

PATIENT X627
Yeah I supposed to see Rheumatology next month.

DOCTOR X627
Okay.  That was the other question but let you go first to the Pain Clinic for anything.

PATIENT X627
Right.

DOCTOR X627
Because sometimes, not in all the joints but the joints that hurt the most they can uh inject steroids that will take the pain away from uh.

PATIENT X627
They want that too but I'm a diabetic so they didn't want to inject me on that floor.

DOCTOR X627
Who said that?

PATIENT X627
That's what I meant that I know.  I @@@.

DOCTOR X627
Who?

PATIENT X627
Well since I been up here.

DOCTOR X627
Yeah but in which clinic?  

PATIENT X627
Here.

DOCTOR X627
Here in General Medicine.

PATIENT X627
Right, right.  @@@.

DOCTOR X627
The steroids would increase the sugars yes.  The problem is that they can deal with the sugars with @@@ as long as it takes care of the pain okay.  Now is this the first time you going to go to Rheumatology?

PATIENT X627
Yeah, yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X627
Yeah I remember what @@@.

Right because he told me that I was drinking.

DOCTOR X627

DOCTOR X627
You know what?

PATIENT X627

DOCTOR X627

PATIENT X627
To get out of that pain, that pain.  I know.

DOCTOR X627
The Rheumatology doctors are the joint doctors.

PATIENT X627
Right, right.

DOCTOR X627
Okay.

PATIENT X627
Yeah.

DOCTOR X627
They got some new kinds of medications for this type of pain.

PATIENT X627

DOCTOR X627
Okay.  It's not; it's medications that really have turned the life around for a lot of people.

PATIENT X627
Okay.

DOCTOR X627
What these medications do though, you cannot take them if you are at risk of tuberculosis.  One, well let me finish.

PATIENT X627
Okay.

DOCTOR X627
You know people are in joint pain that they can live with that.  People cannot live without liver.

PATIENT X627
Yeah.

DOCTOR X627
They cannot live without kidneys.

PATIENT X627
Right.

DOCTOR X627
They cannot live without heart or brain.

PATIENT X627
I thought that, what the problem is messing with my pills.
 
DOCTOR X627
The Vicodin.

PATIENT X627
Yeah.

DOCTOR X627
Hydromorphone and acetaminophen.

PATIENT X627
@@@ right.

DOCTOR X627
While you are taking your pills.  @@@.

PATIENT X627
Huh, no that's right.  

DOCTOR X627
We've got drug names for Vicodin @@@.

PATIENT X627
@@@.

DOCTOR X627
The tuberculosis drug is isoniazid.

PATIENT X627
Yeah that don't mess with them?

DOCTOR X627
That in maybe 1 to 2% of the patients can match with the liver and your liver so far has been doing fine.

PATIENT X627
But @@@ with the drug.

DOCTOR X627
Yes.  @@@ they said lower your @@@ because we were already giving you Vicodin for that now.

PATIENT X627
Right.

DOCTOR X627
So that's not an issue and your uh liver is doing okay.  Uh as far as the @@@.

PATIENT X627
You got the kidneys, what about the kidneys?

DOCTOR X627

DOCTOR X627
Let's see.

PATIENT X627

DOCTOR X627
But the first thing is @@@ answer for the kidney because it can um.

PATIENT X627
Right that's what they and it's in my @@@.

DOCTOR X627
I understand it.  The Naproxen can damage your kidneys and your stomach.  Uh hydrocodone and acetaminophen that's what you take damages your liver uh and you take a lot.  If we came down to only one pill take care of all this joint pain can you imagine how much that you taking less you're going to take and how happy you're gonna be, so hang in there.  I mean you're halfway through.

PATIENT X627
Well @@@ using it every day.

DOCTOR X627
You're taking.  You got those pills on the 6th, three weeks ago; you've got another week to wait regarding the refills you have left.  So you have enough, it's not a matter of me not ordering it, you have enough.  It's a matter of time really.  Uh let's see what @@@.  Yet you are out of it?  Are you out of them completely uh the pain meds pill?
 
PATIENT X627

DOCTOR X627
The Naproxen I can give you some of that.

PATIENT X627
I think I called in for, called in I don't know to get a refill or what.

DOCTOR X627
For which one?

PATIENT X627
Naproxen.

DOCTOR X627
They filled it; they sent it on the 20th.  Let's see did they mail it.  They mailed it on the 20th so it should be, they mailed that.  They mailed the cream.

PATIENT X627
Okay yeah they mailed the cream.

DOCTOR X627
Okay so definitely that.

PATIENT X627
Okay.

DOCTOR X627
The @@@.  That was probably for the pain as well.

PATIENT X627
Yeah I use yeah that cream, well I been rubbing down on that.


DOCTOR X627
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X627

DOCTOR X627

PATIENT X627

DOCTOR X627
Hmm.

PATIENT X627
@@@ right here, it @@@ full.

DOCTOR X627
Let's do something.  I think we can @@@ too, let's see.  They have @@@ I think the same thing @@@.  Uh Naproxen, trazodone.  Are you taking trazodone for sleep?

PATIENT X627
Yeah, yeah, it working out.  You know I'm on my tank now, I'm on uh CPAP.

DOCTOR X627
Uh-huh CPAP.

PATIENT X627
Yeah CPAP.

DOCTOR X627
The thing with the mask.

PATIENT X627
Right.

DOCTOR X627
Did it help you?

PATIENT X627
Yeah I forgot to put some water in it, something like stuffing me up so I don't know whether I can do that anymore.  I took it off because I'm having stuffed it, cause the humidifier, I can't @@@ with the humidifier.

DOCTOR X627
Oh your using a humidifier.

PATIENT X627
Right.

DOCTOR X627
Um let's see @@@.  Okay yeah um.  I'm looking at long term.  I'm looking how @@@ better.  Its new mask @@@, your tuberculosis treated.

PATIENT X627
And my breathing @@@ look good.  @@@.  It's just messed up, it just messed up with me, it just came in up again, like it hanging up.

DOCTOR X627
All your joints.  It's not one joint, if it was only one joint it's.

PATIENT X627
Right, right.  This one's like, that knee and if it swells up, that's my elbow right here.

DOCTOR X627
So what you need to do is just @@@.

PATIENT X627
That's what I did.

DOCTOR X627
That @@@ affect all the joints, take the pain away from the joints.  So if I can treat your tuberculosis, if the Rheumatology doctors can help you find the perfect pill for you and when you take the pill from the rheumatologist will make the pain much better you'll be taking so much less medication, be more active.  By being more active you'll move more, hopefully lose some weight.

PATIENT X627
I'm losing weight, I lost some.

DOCTOR X627
By losing more weight you won't need to use the patch don't you see?

PATIENT X627
That's what cause it?

DOCTOR X627
Yeah obesity.  That's another @@@.  So that's the number one killer.  So @@@ what I'm saying is the answer to the problem is not add another pill, add another @@@.

PATIENT X627
No.

DOCTOR X627
@@@.

PATIENT X627
@@@ I'm trying to find out the truth of what's going on @@@, genetic what I got that.  I knew what genetic was.  @@@ genetic wise but I haven't @@@.

DOCTOR X627
That's why, understand there are a lot of people in your family have similar problems and it can be a genetic thing, something that's passed down.

PATIENT X627
Right that's what I'm saying.  I know @@@ this.  If you know they could do a blood test like that.

DOCTOR X627
Uh-huh.  Uh most often no but yet let me see if Rheumatology has done any, just double check and then if not I can always.  Whether they have done it or not I can I'll do some blood work today but next time you come here.

PATIENT X627
Yeah I'll do it next week.  I'll be up next week and I'll get it.

DOCTOR X627
Okay I'll put it for Monday and come you can do it anytime next week.

PATIENT X627
Okay.

DOCTOR X627
Uh but do it before you see Rheumatology.

PATIENT X627
Yeah okay.  Yeah I'll seem the 15th.

DOCTOR X627
15th.

PATIENT X627
14th it would be.  NAME my cousin always had gout, uh what's that other thing that he gets.  @@@.  But that @@@ what it feels like.

DOCTOR X627
Yep, yeah um gout.

PATIENT X627
Yeah.

DOCTOR X627
Yeah we have gout that would give pain uh.  I would give you pain in some joints but not all over the body.  Um that's, so I'll put them for next Monday but um.

PATIENT X627
So even if they give me shots in my arms that still wasn't to give me that limitation I feel in them.  I'm really losing patience and motion.

DOCTOR X627
More @@@ yeah.  We'll try to get some of it back.

PATIENT X627
They just don't want my joints like, I don't know what.  I'll see I'm, I know like @@@ question now is it's hard for me to cut down on the tramadol.

DOCTOR X627
Yeah, @@@.

PATIENT X627
Right and that can mix.  You know what I'm saying; it'll give too much what they call it?

DOCTOR X627
Uh.

PATIENT X627
If you could just call some in I'd be fine.  

DOCTOR X627
Right, right, right, stenosis.

PATIENT X627
Stenosis.  @@@.  Yeah.  I know @@@ cause I had a doctor, DOCTOR checked, when he checked yesterday.

DOCTOR X627

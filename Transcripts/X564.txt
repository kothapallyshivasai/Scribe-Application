Were you taking clonidine?

PATIENT X564
Yeah clonidine I'm still taking that too yeah.

DOCTOR X564
And you've been taking it cause the medication expired.

PATIENT X564
It expired?

DOCTOR X564
Well it means that it wasn't active.

PATIENT X564
Yeah.

DOCTOR X564
You're still taking every day, the clonidine?

Yes the clonidine and uh Vicodin I think @@@.

DOCTOR X564
The nifedipine?

PATIENT X564
Yeah.  The three yes, nifedipine and the lisinopril.

DOCTOR X564
Okay, okay great.  So the clonidine just make sure that you are taking all the time because when you miss clonidine then they have the affect what's called rebound hypertension.

PATIENT X564
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X564
So it can make your hypertension a lot worse.

PATIENT X564
It does okay.

DOCTOR X564
Yeah and so that can be pretty dangerous if you miss the doses of the clonidine especially.

DOCTOR X564
Of um you can put some like a little band-aid over it, see if that like.

DOCTOR X362
Hi.

PATIENT X362
I haven't seen you in so long I almost didn't recognize you.

DOCTOR X362
Okay in here.  Anything bothering you now?

PATIENT X362
The word's no, nothing.

DOCTOR X362
Oh.

PATIENT X362
I did my blood work.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah I saw that.

PATIENT X362
She had a hard time getting my blood today too.

DOCTOR X362
Really actually it looks pretty good.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Uh except your hemoglobin A1c went up a touch, it's 6.1, it was in the 5's previously.  Um but that could also be maybe cause um you've been eating more sweets lately or anything like that.

PATIENT X362
What?

DOCTOR X362
Have you been eating more sweets lately?

PATIENT X362
Not really.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.  It went up a touch.

PATIENT X362
Oh.

DOCTOR X362
It's not, the other time.

PATIENT X362
The only thing I eat that's sweet is yogurt.

DOCTOR X362
Okay I'm not really all that concerned.

PATIENT X362
Really that's all; no I don't eat sweets too much.

DOCTOR X362
Well I saw that you called yesterday.  I didn't call you back knowing that you were going to be in clinic today okay.  Um so I know that the urology people called you about what they found right in the lab?

PATIENT X362
I don't understand it.  I got a copy of this report. 

DOCTOR X362
Yeah so.

PATIENT X362
Did you get that?  You get that?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Oh you know okay.

DOCTOR X362
So basically they did the lab.  They don't think its cancer yet but they did find, so keep in mind prostate cancer is one of those things that is very slow growing.

PATIENT X362
Hmm.

DOCTOR X362
And the likelihood of somebody passing away from prostate cancer, even if they have it is low.  They will probably pass away of whatever else is affecting them.  So even though you, so it's kind of like someone let's say if you have high blood pressure but then you have diabetes, the chances are you're gonna die of a complication from diabetes than from high blood pressure.

PATIENT X362
What do they call cancer, what's the term for?

DOCTOR X362
Adenocarcinoma.

PATIENT X362
Oh that's what that means oh.

DOCTOR X362
Yes.

PATIENT X362
I seen it in the report twice, that's all.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah it just means adenocarcinoma it's just describing the type of cancer.  That's a glandular cancer that the kind of cell okay.

PATIENT X362
So basically I'm kind of stable?

DOCTOR X362
Well.

PATIENT X362
Or a little bit higher.

DOCTOR X362
It's found, I think what they're trying to describe.  It's a little weird cause they usually say yes it is cancer or no it is not cancer but then they wrote suspicious for so I think they found like a collection of cells that might be heading the cancer route.  Like the way they organize themselves is different from normal tissue so if you have normal tissue or something in between the grey zone and then cancer tissue.  I think they found something that was in the grey zone.  Okay so that's why they wanted to repeat a biopsy in a year and to see.

PATIENT X362
She told me, now usually I come every July.

DOCTOR X362
Hmm?

PATIENT X362
They told me when I left that I'm gonna come back in December.

DOCTOR X362
In December, let me see what they said.

PATIENT X362
I didn't, I didn't say nothing but I just figured well.

DOCTOR X362
No that's fine.  Will need repeat biopsy in one year with another PSA.

PATIENT X362
That's what I usually get every year, same month, July always.

DOCTOR X362
So you always get biopsies done?  Of the prostate, you have done because of the high PSA right?  Okay.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
So remind me around December 10 next time you see me so @@@ every six months.  Remind me that Urology hasn't called me back um but they told you six months over the phone?

PATIENT X362
No they told me when I was leaving the clinic.

DOCTOR X362
Right.

PATIENT X362
I don't really know.

DOCTOR X362
They told you six months though.

PATIENT X362
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X362
That's what they told you.  Okay that's fine so in December, the winter time, go we'll ask them that question.  Hey you told us we could come back in six months, your note says to me what is it and then I've got @@@.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
So remind me about that.

PATIENT X362
You ordered me to have um liver biopsy.

DOCTOR X362
I didn't order it but somebody did.

PATIENT X362
Somebody did right.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.  Did they do it yet?

PATIENT X362
They cancelled it.

DOCTOR X362
Why?

PATIENT X362
Because when I went in there I couldn't remember when's the last time I took any aspirin so because I wasn't sure exactly they didn't want to take the chance.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
But I called them and asked them to reschedule.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
But they never answered it.

DOCTOR X362
Call them again cause I can't do anything more than have you reschedule it.

PATIENT X362
Is that important?

DOCTOR X362
Hmm?

PATIENT X362
Is it really important or what?

DOCTOR X362
No but they're just trying to see.  The reason why we sent you is the hematology, the blood doctors, because your platelets were low.

PATIENT X362
Right I remember now.

DOCTOR X362
Let's see today, they're still low so, they're still low so we're trying to find the cause of that and so they found that your spleen was big.  Lots of times when people's spleens are big then they also have low platelets cause the spleen sequesters all the, eats up all the platelets okay.  But then we'll wonder why the spleen's big and why is that, why is it doing that so then they found that the liver was big also.  And usually then the liver's big then the spleen gets bigger too.

PATIENT X362
The spleen's over here right?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.  Spleen's on that side, liver's on this side.

PATIENT X362
Right.

DOCTOR X362
And they're all connected.

PATIENT X362
But this used to hurt bad sometimes.

DOCTOR X362
When?

PATIENT X362
Over the last few years.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
And you know what they told me.

DOCTOR X362
What.

PATIENT X362
Oh that's just scar tissue.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.  I mean that could be scar tissue.  But your spleen is actually like way up here, it's like way up here.

PATIENT X362
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X362
It's not down here, its way up here near your ribcage and so then they're well you've got, you have fatty liver.  Why do you have fatty liver and you have a history of drinking so it could be related to that.

PATIENT X362
I really don't.  The drinking's so far back I mean.

DOCTOR X362
I know, I know but that can still do it.  It doesn't matter when you drink it can still do it.  So then that's why they're just trying to find the cause of it.  It's nothing that needs to happen urgently but that should happen at some point within the next year.  I think before 2012 was over I'd try to get the biopsy done okay.

PATIENT X362
I had to call you for the appointment right?

DOCTOR X362
No you call the GI Lab, the GI doctor.

PATIENT X362
Not originally.

DOCTOR X362
Huh?

PATIENT X362
They sent me a letter that I had to call and set up the appointment with you and I called back and said well yeah you're supposed.

DOCTOR X362
To have an appointment with me?

PATIENT X362
Yeah your.

DOCTOR X362
You need to make that appointment.

PATIENT X362
No me?  They said make it.

DOCTOR X362
That's fine that you're seeing me.  You're here.

PATIENT X362
That's what I did.

DOCTOR X362
You're just here for your follow-up.

PATIENT X362
Oh.

DOCTOR X362
But that's something separate.  The liver thing is completely different.

PATIENT X362
No I know that, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about this.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X362
How I ended up here today.

DOCTOR X362
No that's fine.  That's how they're doing it these days.

PATIENT X362
Yeah right that's what's going.

DOCTOR X362
They just sent you a letter and then you call in to make the appointment.  So I suggest you, whoever you call to schedule it in the first place, the liver biopsy, call them and go okay I'm not taking my aspirin or tell me when I should be scheduled.

PATIENT X362
Well I thought, that's why I thought you scheduled.  I didn't schedule that.

DOCTOR X362
I didn't schedule the liver biopsy but.

PATIENT X362
After you met me that time.

DOCTOR X362
The liver doctors.

PATIENT X362
I had all that stuff come up, those appointments.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
You know and uh.

DOCTOR X362
The liver doctor scheduled it for you.

PATIENT X362
Hmm.

DOCTOR X362
So what you can do, you can go up to the GI people, the GI Lab right now, to the 13th floor after your done and go like I was supposed to be scheduled for a liver biopsy, it was cancelled because I was still on aspirin but my doctor would like me to reschedule it.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
If not, if they say no you need to see the doctor then tell them to make an appointment with the liver doctor that you saw okay in clinic and then they'll.

PATIENT X362
But I never saw a doctor.

DOCTOR X362
Sure you did.

PATIENT X362
I did?

DOCTOR X362
Yes you did.

PATIENT X362
I saw one of your.

DOCTOR X362
There's a note right here.

PATIENT X362
I saw an Indian doctor.  I don't know, no he wasn't a doctor.  He was more of a nurse type guy.

DOCTOR X362
No you saw a doctor.

PATIENT X362
He was a doctor?

DOCTOR X362
He was an Asian guy yeah.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
He was an Asian guy, he's a doc, he's a GI fellow.

PATIENT X362
Oh really.

DOCTOR X362
So he saw you and so he.

PATIENT X362
He didn’t have a white coat on.

DOCTOR X362
That doesn't mean anything.  So yeah he saw you and he's the one who scheduled it.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
So you have to go back up to the 13th floor and be like hey I need to see the person's name.  It's a common last name but I never know how to pronounce it.

PATIENT X362
What, say it?

DOCTOR X362
I think its DOCTOR is actually how you really say it but if you were to say it phonetically it's DOCTOR or something like that.  DOCTOR.

PATIENT X362
Alright.

DOCTOR X362
DOCTOR um.

PATIENT X362
Can you ask me about how my uh acupuncture went?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah, I just read that note.

PATIENT X362
It was amazing.

DOCTOR X362
How'd it go, really?

PATIENT X362
Now the first time DOCTOR oh she's fascinating.

DOCTOR X362
Really.

PATIENT X362
I thought she was hooked up with the guy on TV.

DOCTOR X362
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X362
But no anyway, she got worried because of my pacemaker.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
So I got clear.  Well she went and did it but once she got me clear.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
The next time I come back she hit me with all the juice they had in that baby.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Whoa that was a wake-up call.  But she said now she's gonna do it every other month instead of every month.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
But I feel better, really a lot better.

DOCTOR X362
Good.

PATIENT X362
And what wasn't supposed to be affected by it was my knee and that got really better.

DOCTOR X362
Good, I'm really happy for you.

PATIENT X362
Unbelievable.  I don't know how it, you know.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
My shoulder got better which was what, you know the arthritis part but the knee and she hooked up the needles with the electricity transmitters and I said how much power are you putting in that sucker, my knee feels like it's coming apart?  She said that now that I know you're cleared from the pacemaker I'm gonna hook you up with the juice.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Oh it's only 20 minutes yeah.

DOCTOR X362
That's good.

PATIENT X362
Yeah, it's cool yeah.  If you get pain and you get a gain it's good.

DOCTOR X362
Let me @@@ here.  My @@@ has been hurting me the last two days.  I didn't even sleep last night.  @@@.  Okay um.  So I wrote in my note about the six months versus one year so that @@@ remember I have it @@@.  Um okay so no more knee pain huh?

PATIENT X362
No.

DOCTOR X362
Good.  All because of the acupuncture?

PATIENT X362
Probably.  Cause I really had, you know I mean I had some of the you know Vicodin.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
And stuff but you know I mean they was helping it but, that really helped it like right away the next day.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
I felt it you know.  But she said the good thing about your situation she said I could exercise six days a week.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah that was true.

PATIENT X362
For two hours a day you know, all the leg did and all this.  She said that's what makes yours work better for you.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Because of the constant daily exercise so acupuncture with exercise works good right now so.  That's a cool science that they did.  Watching her doing it is just amazing.  

DOCTOR X362
No chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X362
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X362
No treatments on your leg recently right?

PATIENT X362
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X362
Okay I know you've been evaluated in the clinic.  Do you have your pacemaker?

PATIENT X362
They did it already.

DOCTOR X362
Routines right.

PATIENT X362
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
It was a month ago, within the last month.

DOCTOR X362
Is it a battery that they changed?

PATIENT X362
I don't know if they replaced it or not.  I think they replaced it.

DOCTOR X362
Let's see.  They changed the generator.  Okay.  And then your cholesterol is good, that's good and you're still taking the same meds or have they changed those around for you?

PATIENT X362
For what?

DOCTOR X362
The cholesterol medications.

PATIENT X362
Who?

DOCTOR X362
The cholesterol medications.

PATIENT X362
Oh no that's all the same, that's all the same yeah.

DOCTOR X362
And you're still following in the Lipid Clinic?

PATIENT X362
Yeah.  Well I haven't been there in a while but they don't usually see me too often.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
You know I want to make something a point to you, just it's not personal but.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
I have to tell somebody cause it's bugging me.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
You know I get a lot of medications.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
I get them through the mail.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
You know and I've had a run in over the phone with the Pharmacy about and I tell them, how come I'm running out already?

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
You know and they're like I'm not scheduled to get some or you must be using too many of them.  I said no I'm not.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
So after that argument, which was a couple months ago, I started emptying the bottles when I get them and counting them.  They're short count.

DOCTOR X362
Oh really.

PATIENT X362
Now what?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
With all the patients here, sometimes it's three, sometimes it's five, that's the maximum but you know how many pills you can you know.

DOCTOR X362
I know.

PATIENT X362
How big that is, that you know prescription drugs?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
I mean I only go by what I hear on TV but that's a big market nowadays.

DOCTOR X362
Okay so there's a lot of medicines you are on though like you said.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
I'm gonna renew all of them and @@@.

PATIENT X362
Right.

DOCTOR X362
So now you'll get your supplies.

PATIENT X362
Oh thank you.

DOCTOR X362
So those are renewed.  Some of them you're on 30 days.

PATIENT X362
Well I hope nobody's stealing this stuff.  I mean I almost think somebody is.  Those drugs that get on the street are coming from pharmacies, no matter what kind of pharmacist.  If it's Walgreens or CVS or the hospitals you know but they're coming from pharmacies cause they're all prescription drugs.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
And the worst one I heard about, I heard it today on a special on TV OxyContin.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Am I saying that right?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.  Oxycodone.

PATIENT X362
That's as good as heroin.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
I didn't know that until I saw that show on TV.  They have some good shows on TV sometimes, the informative ones you know.

DOCTOR X362
I'm gonna renew some cause you are running low on your meds okay or do you like.  I'm pretty good this year.  I've been pretty good every time you called I renewed it.  Do you want to keep it that way or should I renew the ones that you're running low on right now?  How do you want to do this?  It's up to you.

PATIENT X362
I still renew them.

DOCTOR X362
Huh?

PATIENT X362
I can still renew them.  I keep up with it pretty good.

DOCTOR X362
Are you, do you have a good supply of all your meds right now?

PATIENT X362
Yeah.  I don't let it get too low though.  I just.

DOCTOR X362
Do you call before they run out?

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Okay good.

PATIENT X362
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X362
So why don't we just do that.  Is there anything that you might be running of soon?

PATIENT X362
No.

DOCTOR X362
No okay, why don't we just do that.  Cause there's so many meds here.

PATIENT X362
Yeah I do it all.

DOCTOR X362
And it's just better to do it as you run out I think okay.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
And then that way I can put in the order that way.  Um otherwise looks like you're doing really well.  You're due for a repeat colonoscopy next year so I won't be putting in the order or maybe I will before I leave cause I only have another 10 months up here and you know.

PATIENT X362
Don't start that.

DOCTOR X362
I graduate in June.

PATIENT X362
And then what are you gonna do?

DOCTOR X362
Um I'm applying for Rheumatology right now so.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
All over the xxx.

PATIENT X362
Oh.

DOCTOR X362
So I don't know if I'll get it here but somewhere I will.

PATIENT X362
Cause the doctor I had here for it she left.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah well we're only here for three years.

PATIENT X362
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X362
That's the maximum that we can stay here for internal medicine.  Question, have you actually had a heart attack before?

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
You have okay.

PATIENT X362
Well they said two.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
Cause that was my thought I don't know.

DOCTOR X362
Right.

PATIENT X362
But they said that's the reason they wouldn't operate on my knee.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
I had one during my first operation.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
And then when I wanted the second operation for them to reconstruct you know the last @@@.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
They said there's a possibility you'll have another heart attack, I said I don't care cause I don't want to live with this and I had another heart attack they said.  I mean I can only go with what they told me otherwise.  Cause I was already here but I don't know you know.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.  So nothing else right today?

PATIENT X362
Not really you know.

DOCTOR X362
You look good.

PATIENT X362
Something that concerns me every once in a while and I don't know.  In the morning when I get up I check my blood pressure and do all my stuff to know I'm in shape my blood pressure's usually high in the morning.

DOCTOR X362
Like how high?

PATIENT X362
140-150.

DOCTOR X362
Were you doing anything before then, were you?

PATIENT X362
Sleeping.

DOCTOR X362
Sleeping.  We could start you on something else if you'd like.

PATIENT X362
Then it goes down you know as the day goes on.

DOCTOR X362
So how high does it go?

PATIENT X362
It goes down to 115, 120 and stays there basically.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
It never goes back up again, it's just the first.

DOCTOR X362
How high, what's the highest that you ever see?

PATIENT X362
170.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.  Then you probably need to be started on medicine then.  Let's see what you're on now.

PATIENT X362
But when it gets high the first time I check it two more times.

DOCTOR X362
You are on hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and metoprolol and that's it.  Basically we need to go up on them.  Do you follow a cardiologist?  A heart doctor?

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Hydrochlorothiazide 25, lisinopril 10, we can increase the lisinopril to 20, 20 mg.

PATIENT X362
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X362
We can do that.

PATIENT X362
Once a day or twice a day?

DOCTOR X362
Once a day.

PATIENT X362
Once a day.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Oh I get 10 now.

DOCTOR X362
Right.

PATIENT X362
So all I got to do is take two.

DOCTOR X362
Right.

PATIENT X362
Until I get the new one yeah.

DOCTOR X362
So I'll go ahead and when the new one comes just taking two of them.  So when you go home you can take the other 10.  The metoprolol is already at 25.  Your heart rate was in the 60s so we'll keep that one also.  So yeah we'll do the lisinopril okay.

PATIENT X362
So I got 10 months with you huh?

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Geez.

DOCTOR X362
So maybe just one more time.

PATIENT X362
Huh?

DOCTOR X362
Maybe cause I see you every six months.

PATIENT X362
You have to give me an autographed picture.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
I've lost a lot of good doctors this way.

DOCTOR X362
I know.

PATIENT X362
It gets bad afterwards, you know you get so attached to some people and then.

DOCTOR X362
I know.  So but that's just the way it is.

PATIENT X362
You don't get attached to patients do you?

DOCTOR X362
No I do, I mean.

PATIENT X362
Do you really yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.  But the thing is like we're so overworked you know and then it's just sometimes.  Like today it's really easy for me and they only put three patients in my clinic so I'm like chilling and relaxing.  Now with the 30 residents we're supposed to have seven patients, they all cancelled today for some odd reason.

PATIENT X362
Friday.

DOCTOR X362
Fridays.

PATIENT X362
And it's nice out.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah right.

PATIENT X362
Did you call and tell me to come early or did somebody else?

DOCTOR X362
I did it.

PATIENT X362
You did.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
They told me to come an hour earlier but see when I asked.  When I have an appointment to see you.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
I always call back and ask do you want me to do blood work.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Because I usually assume that you want that.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Oh not right now, then the next time I call I say you sure, oh yeah we changed our mind yeah get the blood work.

DOCTOR X362
Actually don't call them at that time cause I usually, I see so many people that I don't order the labs until the day before until I review.

PATIENT X362
Oh that's what they did yeah.

DOCTOR X362
So call like in the evening the day before.

PATIENT X362
Oh now I know.

DOCTOR X362
And then be like hey do I need to come in for labs?  Do that from now on.

PATIENT X362
Cause it's not really a problem.

DOCTOR X362
Cause I always order like the day before Med Clinic cause I look at, cause I pre-write all my notes the day before you're coming in and then I look through the chart see what happened since the last time you've been here, do you need your labs, do you not need new labs, all of that stuff I do it the day before so otherwise I'll forget.  There are so many people I see and we get so many alerts for everybody like you need to do this and that or please do this, these are the results of this consult, it's not just one patient it's like 100 of them so.

PATIENT X362
Hmm.

DOCTOR X362
I try to do everything right before the appointment cause I want to know what's going on with you and I remember what to talk to you about and I know that okay this person needs lab, we need to get lab.  So call like on 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock the day before your appointment.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
At least for the next nine months, ten months.  I don't know how some of the doctors can have it on the system and things are a lot.

PATIENT X362
Do you know who's replacing you yet?

DOCTOR X362
Oh no they haven't even started yet.

PATIENT X362
No, they haven't even picked one.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah cause it's the academic year, so we're still training.

PATIENT X362
Alright.

DOCTOR X362
So every July is when new people come in.

PATIENT X362
So after when you graduate you're promoted?

DOCTOR X362
So I could technically be a full-fledged doctor and practice out in the world, the real world.

PATIENT X362
The real world.

DOCTOR X362
But I want to go specialize.

PATIENT X362
Oh.

DOCTOR X362
Real world meaning no one else is supervising me.  Like right now I have to go talk to an attending be like hey this is my.

PATIENT X362
DOCTOR?

DOCTOR X362
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X362
Right.

DOCTOR X362
This is what I'm gonna do for this patient, do you agree with me and so if they agree or disagree.

PATIENT X362
Is there any particular hospital that you like?

DOCTOR X362
Well I don't know like I don't have any.

PATIENT X362
You don't have anything checked.

DOCTOR X362
Long term I don't plan on staying in the xxx area.

PATIENT X362
Oh really.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.  It's not just the doctors and the traffic is @@@.

PATIENT X362
It isn't?  Why not?

DOCTOR X362
You pay; you pay a lot in malpractice.

PATIENT X362
Oh really.

DOCTOR X362
@@@.

PATIENT X362
But we're so crazy, they teach us how to sue @@@.

DOCTOR X362
@@@ no like when you spend, I don't know, @@@ million dollars on medical school, your medical education and you're having the loans like, getting like a regular job isn't gonna cut it and so you're paying back loans and then you have like a certain lifestyle that you want to maintain you know it's just not gonna cut it.  Like when you have and let's say you're married to another doctor with same amount of loans that's like half a million dollars simply in loans.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
And that just fills up over the years you know so and then the ones who do start practicing if half of that money goes to wherever and by the time you're done training you're 30 so by the time you even finish everything and pay everything off you're like what in your 50s.

PATIENT X362
How old are you?

DOCTOR X362
I'm young.  I'm younger than most people.

PATIENT X362
How old is young?

DOCTOR X362
26.

PATIENT X362
Really, the same age as my granddaughter.

DOCTOR X362
So I'm 26 but usually people graduate medical school at 26 but I'm like, well I'll be 27 soon but I'm like two years.

PATIENT X362
What does your husband do?

DOCTOR X362
Fiancée.

PATIENT X362
Oh fiancée.

DOCTOR X362

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362
Well then you can open a clinic on your own.

DOCTOR X362
Maybe but he's in xxx and I don't really want to go to xxx.

PATIENT X362
Oh no me neither.

DOCTOR X362
No.

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362
Yeah so I don't know.

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362
Okay.  But you tell me to go to the 13th floor to check on that.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah go to the 13th floor.  Check on and see if you can reschedule the biopsy date.

PATIENT X362
I will.

DOCTOR X362
And if they say no you should see a doctor again um and I could write like the day that I saw you.

PATIENT X362
Yeah write on there.

DOCTOR X362
That way one of the clerks can look up the.

PATIENT X362
He's on the 13th then right?

DOCTOR X362
He might not be there today but the clerk will be there today.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362

DOCTOR X362

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362
Give me a second (doctor makes a phone call).  Um okay.

PATIENT X362
Does this hot weather bother you?

DOCTOR X362
Uh uh.

PATIENT X362
Not at all.

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362
It's cause I'm Asian.

PATIENT X362
I know that.  You know it's I'm totally good with it.

DOCTOR OUT:  71:40  DOCTOR IN:  77:26

DOCTOR X362
Alright.  So my attending wants me to renew all the meds that have a 0 or a 1 next to it.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
So that's what I'll do so you might get a huge influx of pills in the mail.

PATIENT X362
No problem.  I'll use them eventually.

DOCTOR X362
That's what he wants me to do.

PATIENT X362
I was gonna tell you something.  Where I go to work out at.

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362
My so-called trainer.

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362
She's from India.  Her name is uh NAME.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
I asked her how come she never used a towel or nothing, she says cause I don't sweat.  How can you not sweat?

DOCTOR X362
Well you know, I used to not sweat and then now every time I work out I do sweat so.

PATIENT X362
Right.  It's it because you're here or what?

DOCTOR X362
No that's just um, that's just genetic.  I wouldn't even say it's.

PATIENT X362
Oh really.

DOCTOR X362
I think it's just some people sweat, some people.  Cause I know a lot of Indian men they sweat like.

PATIENT X362
Crazy right yeah.  She told me she was going to India one time, I said I ought to take a trip over there to visit you know see what it's like.

DOCTOR X362
Do you still take the ciprofloxacin, the antibiotic?  No, that's for the biopsy probably so.

PATIENT X362
Ciprofloxacin.

DOCTOR X362
That was for the prostate probably.

PATIENT X362
No, I guess I don't.  No yeah that's right yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
She said I wouldn't last two days in India.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.  Probably not.

PATIENT X362
She says the way you are and the way I know you she says you wouldn't make it.  You'd be crying to get back here.

DOCTOR X362
We're gonna make everything a 90 day supply for three refills.

PATIENT X362
Hmm good.

DOCTOR X362
You still use the bowel regimen, the Senna tablets?

PATIENT X362
Who?

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362
Huh?

DOCTOR X362
Do you need more lancets?

PATIENT X362
No.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
Okay.

PATIENT X362
That's good stuff.

DOCTOR X362
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
It really refreshes you yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Um I think that's it.  So we'll do six months and we'll be seeing you then, sound good?  @@@ today.

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362
So I'm good to go huh till the next time.

DOCTOR X362
You are good to go till the next time.  So just keep calling in your medication orders so that you're not running out and I'll also be on top of it.

PATIENT X362
The only time I got to make an appointment is to see you?

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh so oh one more thing.  You don't have to go upstairs.

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362
And then they can just do it.

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362
Alright.

DOCTOR X362

PATIENT X362

DOCTOR X362
Okay.  And what's your main phone number again?

PATIENT X362
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X362
Okay um.

PATIENT X362
Do you have any younger kids in your family?

DOCTOR X362
I'm the youngest.

PATIENT X362
You're young, you're a baby huh.

DOCTOR X362
I'm the only child yes.

PATIENT X362
Okay.  You know one thing that tickles me.  I have a lot of Indian people within my building.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
More than it used to be but now more so.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
And with all, always the same with most of them, especially the women and the kids, they must train them when they're growing up.  The women, they just go out of their way to do stuff for me I mean my God.  I say thank you, thank you, you're really a guest, you're always @@@ and they're so pleasant.  You know they even teach the kids.  The kids you know come up to me like I'm a God or something, it's crazy.  You know they're so cute I feel like I got a big family you know and I got them all on my floor.  They always come out and speak to me you know.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Yeah they're real nice.

DOCTOR X362
Well that's good.

PATIENT X362
They're a friendly people, really nice.  The kids are very polite.

DOCTOR X362
We're so friendly that we let every other country rule us historically.

PATIENT X362
Historically.

DOCTOR X362
Historically.

PATIENT X362
Yeah I seen all the movies about the British one day.

DOCTOR X362
The British.

PATIENT X362
They were taking all the.

DOCTOR X362
The @@@, the Muslims.

PATIENT X362
There was a lot of Muslims in India still though right?

DOCTOR X362
I mean it's, @@@ in India.  There's no problem within the Muslims.  I mean like I have so many Muslim friends in India that's fine, there's no @@@.

PATIENT X362
I had a situation with a white lady.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Old grumpy one.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
We're on the elevator getting off at the same time to go check our mail.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
There's a Muslim lady.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Right and there's another Indian lady.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
They got off this elevator but I was talking to them on the elevator.  She gets off, she says, what do you think about them people?  What are you talking about?  Well them two.  What about them?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
Did they say something to you?  No.  Then what are you talking about?  xxx xxx lady had the greatest outfit on you know it was trimmed and sewn well I was complimenting her on it at any rate.

DOCTOR X362
You know lots of time.

PATIENT X362
People are stupid.

DOCTOR X362
Unfortunately right now in America because of 9/11 and everything else that's going on around the world it's unfortunately cause if you think about it I mean like lots of Christians will wear necklaces with a cross on it but no one thinks anything of it you know.  So a lot of Muslim women will wear the scarf so that's just part of their cultural get up.

PATIENT X362
Right, right.

DOCTOR X362
So for us it's more that oh they're being oppressed but some of them would actually want to wear it you know.  I mean I wouldn't want to cause I wasn't raised that way but there's like your.

PATIENT X362
Who was the doctor you replaced?

DOCTOR X362
She was Muslim.

PATIENT X362
Okay.

DOCTOR X362
And she doesn't.

PATIENT X362
I couldn't remember her name.

DOCTOR X362
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X362
When she first came here and she was my doctor right.

DOCTOR X362
@@@.

PATIENT X362
She was @@@.  But I was talking to her about it a couple of times, she started laughing.

DOCTOR X362
Well no so I think lots of times it, just one of their goals so I think they dedicate one year to wearing it, it's kind of like they're being very good.  Sort of doing this through the @@@.  I mean I don't know, I'm not Muslim so I don't know any of those reasons or what was behind it but then they do it, so they'll dedicate themselves to one year basically and they'll wear it and then after that they'll carry on with a normal life without wearing it.

PATIENT X362
Are you a Christian?

DOCTOR X362
No I'm Hindu.

PATIENT X362
Who?

DOCTOR X362
Hindu, Hindu.

PATIENT X362
Are you?

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Really.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.  Most Indians are Hindu.  If they're not Hindu.

PATIENT X362
Most?

DOCTOR X362
Most Indians are Hindu.

PATIENT X362
Cause like one lady she was trying to teach me about.

DOCTOR X362
If they are nurses and teachers, for some reason they tend to be Christian.

PATIENT X362
Yeah I noticed that yeah.

DOCTOR X362
And that's all the nurses here.

PATIENT X362
Christian.

DOCTOR X362
Like they are Christian and its funny cause in India most of the Christians are from this one state called Corolla and they have the highest literacy rate.  They're the most educated in terms of English that kind of thing so.  They tend to be, now it's a lot better but back in the day it had the highest literacy rate.

PATIENT X362
One of those ladies tried to show, she gave me a Hindu calendar.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
With some guy on it.

DOCTOR X362
@@@.

PATIENT X362
And I'm like where is the rest of this calendar I wanted to buy a drink.

DOCTOR X362
I don't understand it.  My mom doesn't understand it.  We just listen to like.

PATIENT X362
What's that die you do?

DOCTOR X362
With the henna?

PATIENT X362
Yeah henna that's it.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
I see on her eyes what is that?

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Is that a tattoo?  She said no.

DOCTOR X362
My grandmother actually has a tattoo.  It's common back in the day for even the women to get tattoos.  It's like a symbol for God or something.  At the end of the day I think every religion is actually very similar, some people just have to learn to accept you know.  See what I don't like is somebody knocking on my door trying to convert me to something else.  That I don't appreciate.  I don't mind what religion anyone else is and I respect that religion but don't expect me to convert.

PATIENT X362
Okay but your Hindu but you believe in God.

DOCTOR X362
Right.

PATIENT X362
How many Gods are there, I mean really?

DOCTOR X362
There's a lot.

PATIENT X362
Huh there's a lot be we all have one God.

DOCTOR X362
Right.

PATIENT X362
Basically you know.  We can call Him anything we want you know.

DOCTOR X362
The thing with Hinduism we've still got one supreme person.

PATIENT X362
Right.

DOCTOR X362
Who has all these other little Gods.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.  There's some weird looking Gods.

DOCTOR X362
Right, yeah.  They're all serving @@@.

PATIENT X362
Oh my goodness.

DOCTOR X362
There's a story.  It's the story behind it.  

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
You can't just literally.  It's the story behind it.  But there's a, what's it called, not a mesh but there's a morale behind each story and why the God is that way but that's the story @@@.

PATIENT X362
One of my most favorite movies on cable about Indian people is Monsoon Wedding.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
You saw that?

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
I loved that.  Every time it comes on I watch it again cause it really gets into that family thing.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
You know it brings it right in and they show it quite a bit too.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah they do.

PATIENT X362
That's a good movie, good movie.

DOCTOR X362
So yeah.

PATIENT X362
What I don't understand about India is how they look at slavery of the women the way they do the young ones.

DOCTOR X362
There's an area, an area @@@ that are very rich.  So rich in India is you will never find that kind of lifestyle anywhere in the world.  That's how unusual their lives are.  In terms of that everything is marble.  It's like the rich are very rich in India and the poor are @@@.

PATIENT X362
Really poor yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Really poor and just recently the middle class has been getting large and happy.  They're actually happy about their lifestyle and everything like that.  Now everyone's getting a car.  Before no one had, my parents never grew up around cars you know.  My dad walked to school, you know that kind of thing um but yeah.  So I mean and everything is changing for the better except for the poor in India.  The only thing that, with the population that big you're gonna have poor people.  That's just I think.

PATIENT X362
How many allow really young girls to get husbands?  I thought about like 12, 13, 14?  

DOCTOR X362
My grandmother was 8 when she was married.

PATIENT X362
Eight, you're kidding.

DOCTOR X362
They didn't move in with my grandfather until she was 16 though.

PATIENT X362
Well how she was married then?

DOCTOR X362
The family, the @@@ by family is they did the.

PATIENT X362
Oh they were married but.

DOCTOR X362
They were married but she still lived at home.

PATIENT X362
Oh.

DOCTOR X362
Until 16 so.  At least and each state is different but in our state we had a lot of Muslim people and so I think it was custom.  I don't know back in the day in Christian societies when you are born they decided who you were gonna marry.  It's kind of like well you two are gonna get married together.

PATIENT X362
They still do that.

DOCTOR X362
They still do that.

PATIENT X362
Yeah I know they do cause that's this girl I know.  That's how she got and met her husband.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah so that's how they do it but in Indian they actually go ahead and do the ceremony all together and lots of time with the Muslim people they respected married women or girls but they didn't respect unmarried ones so then things that shouldn't happen happened so in our area there were a lot of strikes, back in the day, between Muslims and Hindus and all the other stuff.  But because they respected Hindu women and their sacredness, they left those girls alone.

PATIENT X362
Did they.  Why when women get in a car with like a man's going and some of them are going why do the women sit in the back seat?

DOCTOR X362
Um you mean if there's a taxi driver?

PATIENT X362
No I'm not talking about a taxi I'm talking about a residential car.  The man gets in the front and drives and the women sit in the back like if there's two women they sit in the back.

DOCTOR X362
I don't know.

PATIENT X362
In my building they do a lot.  I see it a lot.

DOCTOR X362
My building doesn't do that at all.

PATIENT X362
No.

DOCTOR X362
Uh uh, so I don't know.  xxx xxx if there's a driver, if you have a driver.

PATIENT X362
Probably different.

DOCTOR X362
If you have a driver that's hired that's when you only sit in the back.  You never sit in the front.

PATIENT X362
Yeah well that makes more sense.

DOCTOR X362
And if you're in the front it's the man that's in the front.

PATIENT X362
Right.

DOCTOR X362
Cause you don't want the taxi driver getting into your whatever it is.  But it's just custom.  Cause they're a different class, you would sit in the back, it's a different class so.  Working class versus not working basically so.

PATIENT X362
Is it true that Indian people don't bury their dead?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah we cremate.

PATIENT X362
They cremate right?

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
If we had to bury a billion people there would be no place for them.

PATIENT X362
There was no place to bury them right?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah so.

PATIENT X362
That's all I got.

DOCTOR X362
So it's better that way.

PATIENT X362
I seen it in a movie.  They don't bring that up too much.  You don't hear too much about that.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah that's cause other cultures cremate too.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
Some Christians cremate.

PATIENT X362
That's what I've got decided for me, cremation.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
I says yeah sure.  What do I care about the funeral?

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
You know cremate me and get it over with, it doesn't make any difference.  Throw me somewhere, I don't know.  Spread my ashes over Lake Michigan or something whatever you want to do.  Yeah.  I love to study other cultures but you know.

DOCTOR X362
Oh yeah, @@@.

PATIENT X362
India is a very interesting place you know.  I seen old movies from the.

DOCTOR X362
Well the thing is in India there's so many different, it's very tribal and each state.

PATIENT X362
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X362
Also has its own religion so it's almost like separate countries and each type of Indian follows one God and it's very confusing.

PATIENT X362
Yeah oh I got a case for you.  In my building I met this, this family.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
This lady and her husband and her son right.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
And all of a sudden she had, she had to go back to India.  Her husband died, that's what it was.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
Her husband died and her and her son had to go back to India.  

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
I said why, cause they were never married.  He was an American citizen but she never married him so she got nothing.

DOCTOR X362
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X362
So she got deported basically.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X362
That was kind of a bummer.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah.

PATIENT X362
You know the kid too.  He was crying cause he didn't want to go back.  He seen it and didn't like it.

DOCTOR X362
Yeah it's unfortunate.  Like now, there's a lot of medical couples that @@@ actually study in xxx.  Like half of them are in America, the other half is in India.  I know a couple of my cousins who are my age they came to America.  Because in America you have to work.  If you work you'll get the benefits in most cases right.  xxx xxx if you already have money you don't have to work.  You can live a long amazing life without working if your family has money and my cousin's family they have money so they didn't want to work here.  Especially the girl she could be a nice housewife and like her husband's rich, like he owns like a construction company which is huge now because it's like a booming economy there.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
So she's just gonna go ahead and primarily do the whole housewife thing you know and the thing is in India you have servants for everything.  You have a cook.  Every middle class family has a servant.  In America we're cleaning our own bathrooms and we're doing everything even though we're doctors and lawyers or whatever you make.  We're still getting down on all fours and scrubbing our floors.  You know unless you hire somebody but even then it's more expensive here and there it's dirt cheap.

PATIENT X362
Yeah.

DOCTOR X362
You know so I mean for those reasons a couple of my cousins went back because I don't want to do this.  I had a much better life in India you know so.

PATIENT X362
But that's what they do, they come and you know get married, you gotta go back.  Like the woman when her husband died.  She's not an American citizen.

DOCTOR X362
Well it depends on the visa that she came on.

PATIENT X362
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X362
If she's on a school visa then once she finishes school then that's it she has to go back you know.  But her kid if the kid was born in America they can technically stay but obviously he could go with his mom so.  So that's that.  There's lot of stories like that so.

PATIENT X362
Yeah I remember the old movies with what was it xxx xxx the xxxgal dancers.

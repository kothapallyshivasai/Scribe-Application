PATIENT X551
Yeah you too.

DOCTOR X551
My computer's just loading up here.

PATIENT X551
Okay.  That's fine.  This is as fast as I've ever been waited on for an appointment here.

DOCTOR X551
Oh yeah I try to be quick.  Sometimes you know, sometimes I spend so much time with patients I get behind you know trying to make sure everyone can get done, get everything done with them.

PATIENT X551
No I understand.  I know you're busy.

DOCTOR X551
You know.

PATIENT X551
You know so I most of the time I blame it on the, these were the for the last time we were talking about saying I was trying to get my plates and stickers and you told me to bring it back when I came.  I got this one here when I was on the 7th floor.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
Okay and I was wanting to see.

DOCTOR X551
Let's see what we've got here.

PATIENT X551
Yeah and then I got to get me some more copies of my DD214 and I got to get more copies of.

DOCTOR X551
Okay this is for a parking sticker?

PATIENT X551
Parking sticker and the plates.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
That's the same thing.

DOCTOR X551
Okay and it's all.

PATIENT X551
All three of those right.

DOCTOR X551
Alright so I got to see, I got to fill that out?  Anything else today that's bothering you?

PATIENT X551
Uh you know I need to get to I guess Vascular.  I think actually you can feel it right there is a big cyst on the leg, right there.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah can you take this off and we'll take a look at it?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.  I got this when I was in PCF Camp in xxx xxx, Missouri the same year I was discharged; it's a ship, big ship so.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.  This little nodule right here?

PATIENT X551
Yeah, where that little piece of bone is missing.

DOCTOR X551
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X551
And recently it came to the surface on the skin and I couldn't even put my arms down, nor drive.

DOCTOR X551
Where is it right now?

PATIENT X551
Well I took it out.

DOCTOR X551
You took it out?

PATIENT X551
Yeah I cut it, sliced my skin and took it out.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
But arthritis has set in there too and I was telling them two in my eyes when I had an inspection out in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X551
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X551
And then they took one here from my rotator cuff by my first doctor and he said it's totally destroyed and I can't lift my arm unless I do it like this high and then that's as high as it'll go and my arm continuously aches and pains so I guess arthritis is setting into it, there's no more cartilage period and real pain right in this part right here.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
And uh I don't know.

DOCTOR X551
As far as the elbow goes, I guess what are your expectations on what we can accomplish?

PATIENT X551
I really don't know.  We might not be able to do anything but I do want to put a claim in for this because I didn't do that at the time.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
But I put in a claim against my rotator cuff because all this happened at the same time.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
Cause I was jumping @@@.

DOCTOR X551
And both of them happened while you were in the service?

PATIENT X551
Yes.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
Cause they picked me up over the head and you know like being PCF catch is all gravel.

DOCTOR X551
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X551
So they picked me up and it was like five or six guys it's reported everything and they slammed me down the side of my face and my arm was up under me.

DOCTOR X551
Okay when they @@@ you.

PATIENT X551
Yeah so then messed up my leg too.

DOCTOR X551
@@@.

PATIENT X551
Yeah cause I fell down on this.

DOCTOR X551
I don't know if they're gonna be able to take, if it's like arthritic pain or arthritis I don't know how much or what they'd be able to do.  Um.

PATIENT X551
I don't know, see like @@@.

DOCTOR X551
Does it hurt you to move it?

PATIENT X551
Yes.

DOCTOR X551
Back and forth.

PATIENT X551
Yeah it pops.  

DOCTOR X551
It pops.

PATIENT X551
It's not popping right now yeah, yeah.  It pops and then sometimes you know like on a bad day it'll just ache so bad when I'm in the bed you know I have to.

DOCTOR X551
Did you see someone before for that like the orthopedic doctor or?

PATIENT X551
No I just saw my regular MD, DOCTOR; he's at the Family Medical on 115th.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
I been seeing him.

DOCTOR X551
What did he say about it?

PATIENT X551
He said that I need a replacement you know for my rotator cuff.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
And as far as this he said.

DOCTOR X551
Do you have MRIs that have been done here at this facility?

PATIENT X551
Yeah they had one here.  I mean they just stopped even, you know my vascular appointment is one day next month.

DOCTOR X551
I don't think that's going to be a vascular problem though you know.

PATIENT X551
No.

DOCTOR X551
I don't think the Vascular Clinic.

PATIENT X551
Well what kind of doctor you think this might look at that to see what they can do?

DOCTOR X551
Um well probably orthopedics.

PATIENT X551
Okay.

DOCTOR X551
If they think that they're going to do a total shoulder replacement.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Um that could be the orthopedic people that would take a look and if you have a MRI here I think that they would appreciate kind of taking a look at it and then kind of evaluating you.  

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Whether they're gonna do something about the elbow I don't know about that.  I mean you seem to have fairly good function of it but uh.

PATIENT X551
You know sometimes it stiffens up but mostly.

DOCTOR X551
Sometimes I mean they could take another MRI of it and maybe if they want to go and do some like arthroscopic cartilage removal, sometimes they'll do that.  They may even do that on the shoulder.

PATIENT X551
Okay.

DOCTOR X551
Uh.

PATIENT X551
Well I'm pretty sure they're gonna want to take a MRI but I put the claim in anyway so.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.  So you've already put in a claim for that?

PATIENT X551
No I haven't already.  In fact I was waiting to see what they were gonna come up with.  I had, they had to show me, I think they did give me a copy of the MRI but I don't have a DVD player so I got caught in the flood.  I think we talked about that last time.  It destroyed my whole apartment, bed, clothes, you name it, it's gone.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.  I want to log in here.  How's everything else going though?

PATIENT X551
Oh I need to go see my foot doctor, the pediatricians, not pediatricians.

DOCTOR X551
Podiatry people?

PATIENT X551
Yes because I was late, when I went up to the 7th floor on the Psych Ward I missed all of my appointments so they rescheduled me.

DOCTOR X551
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X551
And uh.

DOCTOR X551
Do you need another, to see the podiatry people again?

PATIENT X551
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.  What's wrong with your feet again, can you remind me?

PATIENT X551
Yeah I got a blister on the first toe next to the big toe and its right in between my feet so it constantly stays there.  They can only scrape it down; I don't know how come they can't remove the core.

DOCTOR X551
Okay but it's not a nail care thing?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
They don't have to do anything with @@@.

PATIENT X551
No, I need to get my nails done.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
That they digging down into my foot and it's making it very difficult to walk.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.  So do the Nail Care Clinic and then hopefully within the next two weeks we can get you another appointment.  Let me look real quick maybe they already have one and I won't have to do anything.

PATIENT X551
They may have.

DOCTOR X551
It just takes me a while to kind of log in here and then I can see.

PATIENT X551
Okay.  Let's see is there anybody else I need to see oh, they gave me, you gave me some drops for my ears and somehow or another it disappeared.  I think what it was, is my girlfriend was staying with me; she left because the house got messed up so that's good.  Didn't have her around when the chips were down I don't need her around when things get better you know.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah.

PATIENT X551
So if you could order me some more ear drops that would be.

DOCTOR X551
Oh yeah, yeah, I can um cause was it the itching is that what it was?  What was wrong with the ears?

PATIENT X551
Yeah I kept thinking that the uh.  You know we talked about the swabs last time.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah, yeah I remember.  I told you.

PATIENT X551
@@@ right.

DOCTOR X551
How were the drops working for you?

PATIENT X551
They were working pretty good.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
Yeah and I got dry eyes.  I might have those cause of my glasses.  Now I've already got my glasses, I just got to take them back to the guy, to the doctor to get them fitted.  

DOCTOR X551
How long have you been walking with the cane?

PATIENT X551
Oh almost three years now.

DOCTOR X551
Okay and just to remind me, why do you walk with a cane?

PATIENT X551
Because I have a bad hip and knees.  My knees have arthritis in it so bad.

DOCTOR X551
That's right.

PATIENT X551
With that going on and then you know that foot swole up most of the time you know because of my blood pressure.  My blood pressure keeps, this morning I woke up and both of my hands look like boxers.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah, actually your blood pressure was actually pretty good today.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Did they tell you what it was?  It was 134/81.

PATIENT X551
Yeah that's what the nurse was telling me.

DOCTOR X551
That's pretty good.  You're taking your medications @@@?

PATIENT X551
Yeah what I did was I, what I did was I took a half of one, half an extra one because I heard news about one of my older gentleman friends that passed Sunday and I got kind of emotional outside and I could feel my heart pumping you know so.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah.

PATIENT X551
And then like I say my hands was swollen up so bad this morning that I took that extra one to try to rush it down.  I've got.

DOCTOR X551
Can I get you up here so I can take a look at that shoulder and that elbow?  Let me see if I can uh.

PATIENT X551
You want the shirt off?

DOCTOR X551
Now I have to put it in the log.  Um yeah so then we can get a good look at the shoulder.

PATIENT X551
Okay.  Yeah these legs, that PAD.  I need to get back in that program.  They sent me a letter but like I say my wife went through the house like a tornado and she threw away what she was my fiancée but she threw a whole bunch of my paperwork away getting picked up you know so I need to find out if I'm still eligible to come, go over there to xxx and just sign up.  I need to come here to try to @@@.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah I don't see actually, I don't see an MRI was done.

PATIENT X551
If they did one, I don't know if they just didn't write it up cause like I told you @@@ being treated for my arm and my leg.  I was going to the podiatrist so I know it was back there, I guess at GU, is that upstairs?

DOCTOR X551
Uh GU is the genitourinary people.

PATIENT X551
Okay.

DOCTOR X551
Kind of like the kidney and the.

PATIENT X551
Okay, well this is for my legs on the second floor.

DOCTOR X551
Second floor.  It could have been um, could have been vascular but.

PATIENT X551
Vascular that's right.

DOCTOR X551
But it could have been, so they decided not to treat you anymore because it wasn't a vascular problem is that what you're saying?

PATIENT X551
Yeah just that they suggested it.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah.

PATIENT X551
Then they had then this PD, PAD Program all the time.  See they got with the VA in order for me to go to xxx and if I, so not this but one day this week I'm gonna get over there to xxx.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah cause they actually did a MRA rather.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
An MRI and it shows like angiography too but everything was actually pretty normal.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Your blood flow is actually pretty good to your feet.

PATIENT X551
Yeah but that's not what they said on paper.  They said they need to send me a paper from xxx cause you can look @@@ my legs swell so bad I can't move.

DOCTOR X551
Alright.

PATIENT X551
But see all this here.

DOCTOR X551
Swelling isn't necessarily.

PATIENT X551
This a broken vein you know.

DOCTOR X551
A problem from lack of blood flow either.  Can you take off your shoes too cause then we can.

PATIENT X551
And as far as I can tell, they already knew that I got the vessels and I have to get something from xxx cause that's a bunch of bull.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  I know I had it cause they gots paperwork from them saying that I had PAD.  So.

DOCTOR X551
Let me see what they put in the notes.

PATIENT X551
I'm thinking cause that ain't what they said to me.  @@@.  I had to put this on my toe, see that, how red it is.  I think I have black socks and my gym shoes on, you'll have to excuse my feet.  @@@.  Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Let's look.

PATIENT X551
Do you need me to take my slack off or not?

DOCTOR X551
Uh that's fine I should be able to feel your pulse.  I just want to make sure that you have good pulses in your feet and I'm going to try to see the Vascular Notes here.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
And see what they said.

PATIENT X551
Cause they were going to operate on my knee, put the stents in and they changed they mind the same day I came in for the operation.  Painkillers the next day and @@@.  @@@ doctor and he just wondered how I feels, what are you talking about, the guy talking to me like a kid.  @@@ with that.  @@@.

DOCTOR X551
So you're gonna see the xxx people now?

PATIENT X551
Yes.

DOCTOR X551
I'm just try to catch up on the Vascular Notes from them.

PATIENT X551
Yeah that'd be more than likely in xxx.  I bet you that I carried around and monitored everything for six months from xxx you now.  I got the paperwork somewhere but I'm gonna get a copy of my records from xxx so @@@.  Just take a look at my feet, you can tell there's no circulation down in my feet.  @@@ crazy.

DOCTOR X551
Can you feeling me touching in here?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Good.  Feeling me here?

PATIENT X551
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.  Now is this what they, they worked on you?

PATIENT X551
It happened at combat boot camp service.  

DOCTOR X551

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Can you feel me touching you there?  Okay.  Going all the way up?

PATIENT X551
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X551
All the way up okay good.

PATIENT X551
See them things that's all of them except back here @@@ and behind my kneecaps too.

DOCTOR X551
Okay nice deep breath good.  Nice deep breath, good.  Alright your right shoulder is the one that bothers you?

PATIENT X551
Yes.

DOCTOR X551
Okay let's try something.  So can you take it and go all the way up with it here?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Kind of pops on you?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
I have to stop.

DOCTOR X551
Can you go all the way up with it?

PATIENT X551
No.

DOCTOR X551
No.

PATIENT X551
I can't get no higher up.

DOCTOR X551
Does that hurt?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Okay where does it hurt?

PATIENT X551
This right joint from the inside all the way to the outside.

DOCTOR X551
Can you put it on down?  Have you ever separated it in the past?

PATIENT X551
You know, but again this was separated when they threw me down by just sitting high.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
And that's what @@@.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah and its hurts @@@.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.  Feel like @@@.

DOCTOR X551
I'm trying to see if there's any like laxity in the joint, let's see.  Can you turn this way, can you make a curl?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
Okay now curl up like this.  Where does it hurt to do that?

PATIENT X551
It don't hurt if I slowly do it but around the blade @@@.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
When I do it, it really hurts though.

DOCTOR X551
Can you go all the way with it though, even if you go through the pain?  Okay.  Okay and back okay.  Can you rotate your arm like that?

PATIENT X551
@@@ painful in the back of my shoulder.

DOCTOR X551
Okay now let's try this one.  Can you come out like this?

PATIENT X551
@@@.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.  Well if I take this, if I send you to the orthopedic people.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
I think that they are going to want some type of imaging.

PATIENT X551
Okay.

DOCTOR X551
Of your shoulder.

PATIENT X551
Okay well I been @@@ too with that.

DOCTOR X551
Cause I don't doubt that you had it done before.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
But if it's not in the computer then here it doesn't really exist, you know what I mean?

PATIENT X551
Right.

DOCTOR X551
So they want to see some good imaging before, before they see you.

PATIENT X551
Hmm.

DOCTOR X551
Um and then they can kind of review the imaging and kind of see what they're dealing with and they say by looking at the imaging and they say no this isn't amendable to surgery or not, maybe we can actually do something that would be beneficial.

PATIENT X551
I understand.

DOCTOR X551
You know, so I don't know what they would actually kind of think.

PATIENT X551
Well even when my first doctor told me it was like the end of 2005 and he was suggesting then you know @@@ that I have emergency surgery on it.  But then it was in the winter time too so I don't know, that's what they gave me an MRI.  They looked at mine and said they couldn't read it.  I don't understand how come they couldn't read it.  It came @@@.

DOCTOR X551
Oh it came from yeah.  So I see a couple MRIs that were done but they're different ones.  They're of the belly and the pelvis.

PATIENT X551
I had all of that @@@.

DOCTOR X551
Um and I don't see any.

PATIENT X551
It would be at the beginning of my medical report I guess because that's when I got it.

DOCTOR X551
Yeah.

PATIENT X551
See that's when I came here.

DOCTOR X551
And this goes back to 2009.

PATIENT X551
Oh.

DOCTOR X551
But actually it goes back all the way but it doesn't have any history of you before then.

PATIENT X551
I don't know why, see that's all messed up.  Everything should be in there.

DOCTOR X551
So.

PATIENT X551
@@@.

DOCTOR X551
So let me go discuss this with DOCTOR okay.  Do you have any other questions; oh I'll run this form and the parking thing by her too okay.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
I think this is just my suggestion but I want to kind of have her back me on it um.

PATIENT X551
Well @@@ cause we don't get along that's why I come here and changed doctors because she told me if it was up to her I would be a D.

DOCTOR X551
So I mean I think an MRI is probably reasonable if we want the orthopedic people.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

DOCTOR X551
But let me discuss it with her first okay.

PATIENT X551
Okay.

DOCTOR X551
I'll be back.

PATIENT X551
Alright.  That's it; I don't really want to talk to her.

DOCTOR X551
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  26:35  DOCTOR IN:  34:30)

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Hi, hi.  Nice the meet you.

PATIENT X551
How you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR X551
I'm DOCTOR.  How you doing?

PATIENT X551
Yeah pleased to meet you.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Okay so the two things, is @@@ shoulder up here?

PATIENT X551
It's real tight.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
You had, this was an old injury.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
And then what was the plan for it?  Can you raise @@@?

PATIENT X551
No I can't, I been through all of that I'm not going to one more thing.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Okay, you're not.  So what was the plan I mean what we can do is, you get this plain imaging, this does not help a lot because the we want to make sure there's not any else going on and then we can refer you to Ortho.  The question is if they offer you surgery are you interested in the surgery or not?

PATIENT X551
Yes cause my shoulder was supposed to be replaced five years ago.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Then you would @@@.  Okay so we do that.

PATIENT X551
You know the doctors changed their mind I done this on my leg.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Whose doctor?

PATIENT X551
The doctors here yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Orthopedics said that?

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Okay. 

PATIENT X551
These were the guys, no they wasn't Ortho, was that Ortho with the knees?

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Yeah we'll send you there.

PATIENT X551
Yeah, yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
I think he was seeing Vascular Surgery and they were going to possibly put in a stent.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
Like the AVIs were like 0.65, they were kind of just like moderate and that's why they did the MRA.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Okay, okay.  So that sounds reasonable because the reason is I talk to the @@@ patient.  Sometimes the flow you're getting through this your own blood vessels is more than what you're going to get through the stent.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
So they the stent was not superior to what already you had.  That's why they won't do the surgery.

PATIENT X551
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
And then they probably said was @@@.  So what definitely we're going to do we'll send you to Ortho, get the plain imaging and then most likely we're going to order the MRI for you and there you go.

PATIENT X551
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
The other thing is you wanted the handicapped parking; you do not meet the qualification of handicapped parking.  This cane at this level doesn't count because people they use that @@@ forever.  They said you're able to walk from.

PATIENT X551
Who says that?

SECOND DOCTOR X551
The State Department.  100 feet, and a 100 feet is from there to there, from here and to that's from the @@@ to the end of the Ward and you can continue to do that.  

PATIENT X551
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Yeah I'm not going to sign it.

PATIENT X551
That's @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
I'm not going to sign it.

PATIENT X551
Yeah that's why @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Okay, @@@.

PATIENT X551
Are we finished so I can go cause I was @@@ I have someplace to get.

SECOND DOCTOR X551
Okay, no problem.

PATIENT X551
@@@.  

FIRST DOCTOR X551
Okay thanks DOCTOR.  So we're going to start with like x-rays of your shoulder and elbow.

PATIENT X551
Yeah, yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
And they'll just call you for that.  I'll order that and then I'll reorder the eye drops okay.

PATIENT X551
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
Um.

PATIENT X551
She talking about I don't need this plate.  See she's stuck on that bullshit.  I can't stand.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
And the ear drops.

PATIENT X551
I am pissed.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
So then hopefully the orthopedic people will call you but we're just going to establish some x-rays okay.

PATIENT X551
Yeah I need to get out of here man cause I feel my blood pressure going up now.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
Okay.

PATIENT X551
I am sick of that broad.  Just check me out so I can get my transportation and get the hell away from here.  @@@.  I asked them not to even, to take her off of my case period.  I don't want no, don’t bring her in on nothing @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
I'd ask you to give this to @@@.

PATIENT X551
Oh and I got a call.  Can I change the clinic visit cause I don't want to have anything to do with her period.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
You can uh; you can ask if you'd like to change clinics, you're able to do that.

PATIENT X551
Yeah that's what I want to do.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
You want to do that?

PATIENT X551
Yeah, hang on to that cause I despise the bitch.  Did you sign me out already?

FIRST DOCTOR X551
Watch your mouth okay.  No swearing.

PATIENT X551
Okay then you get away from me too.

FIRST DOCTOR X551
Now you don't impress me.

PATIENT X551
Whole damn clinic.

PATIENT LEAVES:  38:41.

DOCTOR X467
Do you have an appointment with the urology doctor any time, let me see @@@.  Cause there's a note in here thinking we could add to it, so you take the prostate medicine and then we would add another prostate medicine.  The only thing with doing that is that your blood pressure is kind of low, so @@@ whole lot @@@.

PATIENT X467
@@@.

DOCTOR X467
Your waking up every two hours?

PATIENT X467
Uh well yeah I about got used to it but yeah you know, I have to get up.

DOCTOR X467
Right.  Well I may, I know you got your blood work checked yesterday, would you mind getting just one more blood test today?  I want to check your prostate level.

PATIENT X467
@@@.

DOCTOR X467
Cause the last time it was checked was two years ago but I want to see if it got a lot higher um.  Especially if you're having any troubles I think maybe I'm going to talk to DOCTOR but maybe we could start the other medicine and if your blood pressure goes really low or like if you get dizzy or something, you just don't take it.

PATIENT X467
Yeah.

DOCTOR X467
Okay.  I'm going to talk to him about that.

PATIENT X467
Yeah is @@@.

DOCTOR X467
It'd be for having, for the trouble with peeing.

PATIENT X467
But it's @@@ or nothing.

DOCTOR X467
No like it's hard @@@ out you're saying.

PATIENT X467
No it's not hard it's just uh, @@@ you don't have a good stream.

DOCTOR X467
Uh-huh, yeah it's for that like it helps the urine get out easier.

PATIENT X467
Yeah.

DOCTOR X467
Yeah so I'll talk to him about it and we'll see what he says.

PATIENT X467
Okay.

DOCTOR X467
Are you having a lot of @@@.

PATIENT X467
Hmm well when I first start out.

DOCTOR X467
No a little bit but not too bad though.

PATIENT X467

DOCTOR X467
Okay.  Let me uh @@@.

PATIENT X467

DOCTOR X467
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X467

DOCTOR X467
Okay.

PATIENT X467
Is the reason why I get up and go @@@.

DOCTOR X467
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X467
@@@.  Sometime uh @@@ and I lost a lot of blood, I don't know whether it's cause the nose bleeds a lot.

DOCTOR X467
Right.

PATIENT X467
And I don't know if that has anything to do with this thing or not.

DOCTOR X467
Well and your blood count being low will definitely make you more tired and short of breath.

PATIENT X467
@@@.

DOCTOR X467
Yeah.  Uh let me see how low your blood count was 3.6 and before it was 8.9 so it has dropped @@@.  Um you know what we could do about the nosebleeds so you are using the nasal spray right?

PATIENT X467
Yeah I started it again something like @@@ and it bleeds a whole lot.

DOCTOR X467
Do you take your medicine for sleep?

PATIENT X467
Yeah.

DOCTOR X467
Yeah.  I'm gonna order you, just cause I don't see it in the computer anymore, I think it's something you were taking that's not in the computer I want you to try @@@ probably the same thing you were taking @@@ it's kind of like an oil except it's more like water and you put it in your nose and it kind of protects it from bleeding.  The same thing you're taking but it's not in the computer so I'm not sure.  That's what you're taking?

PATIENT X467
Yeah it's not on there, not on that?

DOCTOR X467
No it's not on here.  So that's why I'm not sure what uh what exactly they gave you.  This one is probably what you're taking about but this is like a cream type of thing.  Yeah so the one I want to give you is like a, oh here it is.

PATIENT X467
So I got two of them I'm not crazy.

DOCTOR X467
Yeah, you're right, you're actually right, it's in here, you're right.  

PATIENT X467
Hmm.

DOCTOR X467
So never mind.  @@@ okay.  You're using it four times a day; you want to use it four times a day?

PATIENT X467
No I usually use when I'm driving the car and sometimes I use it then when I got a wheeze, that kind of thing.

DOCTOR X467
Yeah.

PATIENT X467
See I got a sleeping @@@ that I'll put on, @@@.

DOCTOR X467
Are you using @@@.

PATIENT X467
Sometimes my nose will start bleeding when I'm asleep and um, it's lucky that when it starts coming down.

DOCTOR X467
@@@.

PATIENT X467
I @@@ help.

DOCTOR X467
@@@.  Yeah so you need the Coumadin cause we don't want you to get a stroke so, it's kind of a @@@ benefit kind of thing.  If we stop the Coumadin the nosebleeds would stop but then you don't have @@@.

PATIENT X467
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X467
@@@.

PATIENT X467
And the first time I have a light headache and then I'm just tired you know.

DOCTOR X467
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X467
I don't know whether that has anything to do with it or not.

DOCTOR X467
It's probably everybody over the age of like 10 starts headaches around that age but um are you still using your CPAP?

PATIENT X467
Huh?

DOCTOR X467
CPAP machine?  Are you still using it at night?  Oh they just did it yesterday, your sleep study.

PATIENT X467
Yeah I had that.

DOCTOR X467
Did they tell you that you needed a machine?

PATIENT X467
That I need what?

DOCTOR X467
Like a CPAP machine, like the machine when you sleep?

PATIENT X467
Uh oh they told me uh yeah that's what I got.

DOCTOR X467
You got one of those?

PATIENT X467
Yeah.

DOCTOR X467
Okay good and you started using it?

PATIENT X467
Yeah I had the thing that go up in your nose.

DOCTOR X467
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X467
But uh for the last week I went up there and they gave me uh the one you know it don't go in your nose, it goes over your nose.

DOCTOR X467
Right, right.

PATIENT X467
So I got that one.

DOCTOR X467
You've been using that?

PATIENT X467
Yeah but I use it three or four, two or three days.

DOCTOR X467
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X467
Until I get the nosebleeds.

DOCTOR X467
Oh yeah.  So let me talk to my boss to see if he might have any ideas okay.  See if we can do anything about it.

PATIENT X467
Alright.

DOCTOR X467
Alright, I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  126:10  DOCTOR IN:  133:31)

DOCTOR X467
Alright so, for the nosebleeds, he didn't have any ideas either.  The only thing we could think of is that maybe, have you ever been to a nose doctor, like an ENT doctor where they take a camera and go up in your nose and see?

PATIENT X467
No, no more than the doctors here looked at me.

DOCTOR X467
Alright so we'll uh, do you want to go see him and I could put it in right now with the sprays and in the meantime we want to get you to see the ENT doctor, the Ear, Nose and Throat doctors and they can just see if there's anything we can cause they're the experts of the nose and they can just take a really good look inside and see if there's anything that's bleeding or some medicines for it okay.

PATIENT X467
Okay.

DOCTOR X467
And then I'm going to put that here for you know in one week or in one to two weeks.

PATIENT X467
Okay.

DOCTOR X467
They'll schedule it for you right out front there and I'll put it in the computer too.  And then for the um, you know the urinary symptoms you're having, we can actually go up on the tamsulosin that you're taking the 5 mg pills.

PATIENT X467
What.

DOCTOR X467
You could go up to 10 so you'd take two pills instead of just one and I'll change it in the computer um it's this medicine right here.

PATIENT X467
Okay.

DOCTOR X467
The tamsulosin.

PATIENT X467
Alright.

DOCTOR X467
Instead of taking 5 mg take the 10 mg.

PATIENT X467
Okay take two.

DOCTOR X467
Take two.

PATIENT X467
Okay.

DOCTOR X467
Yeah.  When you get this one it's the @@@ medicine okay.

PATIENT X467
Right.

DOCTOR X467
Do you get your medicines mailed to you or do you pick them up here?

PATIENT X467
Uh I get it mailed to me.

DOCTOR X467
Mailed to you.

PATIENT X467
Some of it I pick up at the Pharmacy.  If I need to pick it up, I pick it up but if not they mail it.

DOCTOR X467
Okay.  So like I said if you have some of these left over you can just take two today and I'll get them mailed to you and then you'll take the 10 mg.

PATIENT X467
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X467
Or if you want to just pick it up you can.

PATIENT X467
Okay.  Do which one you want.

DOCTOR X467
Well which do you want?

PATIENT X467
A you can have them mail it.

DOCTOR X467
Okay.  So remember to take two of them tonight.

PATIENT X467
You @@@.  Is it a week to two weeks?

DOCTOR X467
Hopefully you'll get the ENT appointment and they'll schedule the appointment.

PATIENT X467
Hmm.

DOCTOR X467
Then you can come see me in three months.  But @@@ if you want to see me earlier like one month?

PATIENT X467
Yeah one month that way uh.

DOCTOR X467
Yeah you could do that, we could do one month and then see the nose doctors and we'll go over your next @@@.

PATIENT X467
Okay.

DOCTOR X467
Okay.

PATIENT X467

DOCTOR X467

PATIENT X467

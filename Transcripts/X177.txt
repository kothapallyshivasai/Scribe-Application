DOCTOR X177
PATIENT?  

PATIENT X177
Huh?

DOCTOR X177
Come on back.

PATIENT X177
Good enough.  Good morning.

DOCTOR X177
Good morning, how are you doing?

PATIENT X177
Hmm I'm okay I think.

DOCTOR X177
I see you decided, looking at your diabetes stuff, you can just sit in this chair.

PATIENT X177
Okay well.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.  Most of it um, @@@.

PATIENT X177
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we've had all the classes.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
We've had most of the classes.

DOCTOR X177
All those you wanted anyway?

PATIENT X177
No I'll take any class you want me to go to; I'll sit there and try to learn something.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.

PATIENT X177
But.

DOCTOR X177
But.

PATIENT X177
You're killing me with the food.  You're not letting me eat enough.  I know that's really not a problem.  Oh three things I need to tell you.

DOCTOR X177
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X177
I got about ten pills left.  I got about eight strips left.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.

PATIENT X177
And uh the high blood pressure that the pharmacist gave me I have not received it yet.

DOCTOR X177
Oh okay.

PATIENT X177
So I probably need to stop at the Pharmacy before I leave here.

DOCTOR X177
I don't know why you haven't gotten that yet.

PATIENT X177
Yeah.

DOCTOR X177
Let's see.

PATIENT X177
And I figured it's easier to tell you that I need this before I run out than waiting until I get to the last one and say, doctor.

DOCTOR X177
That way I can mail them to you and you don't have to wait in line.

PATIENT X177
Ah the lines not a bit deal, I'm already here.

DOCTOR X177
Most people hate the lines.  

PATIENT X177
That.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ so much.

PATIENT X177
Yeah.  Look the line here takes less than 30 minutes.

DOCTOR X177
Really?

PATIENT X177
Yeah.

DOCTOR X177
I really @@@.

PATIENT X177
If you go to the county it takes two days.

DOCTOR X177
Oh when you keep comparing it to the county.

PATIENT X177
Hey this is a step up, trust me.

DOCTOR X177
You saw the county recently?

PATIENT X177
No, no.

DOCTOR X177
No, you just know for uh.

PATIENT X177
I know for a fact of how it goes.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah.  That is how it goes.

PATIENT X177
Cause you cannot find a doctor, @@@ waiting on somebody.

DOCTOR X177
I @@@.

PATIENT X177
Wow.

DOCTOR X177
So I am very familiar with how the county @@@.

PATIENT X177
Yeah.

DOCTOR X177
I say feel familiar that I.

PATIENT X177
Left.

DOCTOR X177
Over at xxx you can @@@.  But people went to the county from there.

PATIENT X177
Yeah you know what, like I said, even when I was in a position to pay for my own medical, I would never go to County cause like I say it would take me, while you were waiting on one of these great doctors, you could wait right there and die.

DOCTOR X177
Well actually I think the doctors though at xxx xxx are actually pretty good.

PATIENT X177
They probably are but if it takes them two days to get to see you, it doesn't help.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Yeah and if you're not bleeding profusely you get ignored over there.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah this is a um.

PATIENT X177
I realize they have a lot of people to deal with but if you're not gushing blood I seen you know you could sit there 2-3 days waiting on somebody to see you.

DOCTOR X177
Okay so let's see.  Did you see DOCTOR, he's your primary.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh and she gave me some high blood, she told me about some high blood pressure medicine.  I haven't gotten it yet.

DOCTOR X177
Okay so you're on Glargine 8 units.

PATIENT X177
Huh?

DOCTOR X177
Insulin.

PATIENT X177
No I'm on, what is that, @@@.

DOCTOR X177
12 units.

PATIENT X177
12 units of glycotrol or what is it?

DOCTOR X177
I call it Glargine; I think another name for it is Lantus.

PATIENT X177
That's the one Lantus.  

DOCTOR X177
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X177
I can't even take a medicine without even knowing what it is.

DOCTOR X177
And you're on @@@.  Did you want refills on the Lantus?

PATIENT X177
Uh I just got a bottle uh.

SECOND PERSON X177
I think it was on the 13th or 18th.

PATIENT X177
18th I think.

DOCTOR X177
You're on glipizide 10 twice a day?

PATIENT X177
Once a day.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Should be twice a day probably but.  

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
It was twice a day originally.

DOCTOR X177
Okay, @@@.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@ he takes one in the morning and nothing at night.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X177
He takes the insulin at night cause he went down pretty low.

DOCTOR X177
So he does the insulin at night.

PATIENT X177
Yes.

DOCTOR X177
And then let's see and said you're still on the Crestor and lisinopril.

PATIENT X177
Yes cause they're concerned about my liver, taking care of my liver.

DOCTOR X177
Really the @@@.

PATIENT X177
Yeah well I mean I'd like the liver to hang out you know, it's been here this long, keep it around a while.

DOCTOR X177
You definitely need that.  It does have some positive @@@.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
And the lisinopril also protects the kidneys.

PATIENT X177
Kidneys not liver.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
But it's not going to cause your kidneys to get worse @@@.  

PATIENT X177
It would be easier if we just smoked a little pot.

DOCTOR X177
I don't think that really.  How much are you smoking?

PATIENT X177
I smoke about a half pack a day.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.

PATIENT X177
Oh I come down quite a bit.

DOCTOR X177
And how much, yeah you used to smoke a lot more.  Um how long have you been smoking 1/2 pack a day?

PATIENT X177
Since I started coming here.  I'm serious.  I was smoking about a pack and a half a day.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.

PATIENT X177
Yeah.

DOCTOR X177
Um do they have you on any nicotine cessation therapy?

PATIENT X177
No.

DOCTOR X177
Do you want to try it or try to wean yourself off?

PATIENT X177
I'll take whatever you tell me to take.

DOCTOR X177
Well I want you to stop smoking.

PATIENT X177
Okay.  Uh give me the stuff.

SECOND PERSON X177
What about the Chantix?  Have you, is that better than the nicotine?

DOCTOR X177
@@@ also.

SECOND PERSON X177
Yeah.

DOCTOR X177
Then if they also, a lot of times people just seem to do much better.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
Um Chantix works well.  We've seen @@@.

SECOND PERSON X177
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X177
Yeah well TV lies a lot.

SECOND PERSON X177
Depends on them.

DOCTOR X177
So a lot of people, so not a lot, some people have had the side effects.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
But I also know people who say it makes stopping smoking so easy for them.

SECOND PERSON X177
Yeah I heard that too.

DOCTOR X177
Tolerable that and the health benefits of not smoking @@@ pretty safe to @@@ acceptable.

PATIENT X177
Well I don't intend to commit suicide so we don't have to worry about.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ you know.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Homicide maybe.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ every day.

PATIENT X177
Homicide maybe.  Suicide not a chance.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Ohh I resent that, I'm real safe until somebody pushes my buttons.

SECOND PERSON X177
Ahh.

DOCTOR X177
Do you want uh; do you have a stopping date in mind?

PATIENT X177
A what?

DOCTOR X177
A stop date?

PATIENT X177
Yesterday.

DOCTOR X177
Yesterday.

PATIENT X177
Look when I came here, you said I need to quit smoking cause I had this and that and I said okay alright.  Immediately I cut them back.  I was hoping to be through by the time I got back here to see you again.

DOCTOR X177
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X177
But we haven't got there yet.

DOCTOR X177
Usually to stop smoking, you need a stop date and then you stop and you can take the nicotine replacement okay.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
Um now do you think you could take patches or gum?

PATIENT X177
Probably patches cause I don't chew gum.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.  Well gum is good to give people something to do with their mouth.

PATIENT X177
Ah I'd rather eat.

DOCTOR X177
Well.

SECOND PERSON X177
Patches will do.

PATIENT X177
Patches would probably work better yes.

DOCTOR X177
And then um, let's see.  No chest pain, no fevers, no shortness of breath?

SECOND PERSON X177
Shortness of breath yes.

PATIENT X177
A little bit yes, a little bit.

SECOND PERSON X177
And he wheezes.

DOCTOR X177
That's another reason why you should stop.

PATIENT X177
That's probably why I'm wheezing.

DOCTOR X177
Uh-huh.  @@@.  You just had a nuclear stress test, so there's really not much to do for the shortness of breath.

PATIENT X177
Well I'm, quit smoking that would be a great deal of help I'm sure.

DOCTOR X177
You had pulmonary function tests too didn't you, where you breathe into that machine and?
 
PATIENT X177
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

DOCTOR X177
So um.  How far can you walk without having to stop?

PATIENT X177
I walked three blocks yesterday and I damn near died.

DOCTOR X177
But you can do it?

PATIENT X177
Yeah I did it but uh like I said it wasn't easy.  And the other night I was walking to get a pack of cigarettes.  I came back home, I had to sit down and hold my head down and catch my breath.  My knees were hurting.

DOCTOR X177
Uh your lungs aren't even that terrible and they're blaming a lot of what's going on the fact that you have um, that you smoke.  Cause a lot of your signs are consistent with a smoker.

PATIENT X177
I been working on it.

DOCTOR X177
One thing at a time right?  All of a sudden @@@.

PATIENT X177
Yeah, that I didn't even know was there.  Well when I started smoking cigarettes they were a quarter a pack.  Now they almost $10 a pack.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Yep.

DOCTOR X177
That's good.  I don't know @@@ at all.

PATIENT X177
Yep you don't smoke.

DOCTOR X177
Nope.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
They did an @@@ right?

PATIENT X177
Yes.

DOCTOR X177
And you got an eye.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh, yes, well I got to do that over cause they didn't like the results.

DOCTOR X177
How come?

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@ whatever the results were, they didn't believe it was that poor so they had to redo it a certain day.

DOCTOR X177
Oh @@@.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

DOCTOR X177
Okay I just have to @@@ something that blocks the view of the @@@.

PATIENT X177
Okay.  Cause I would really hate to give up driving at night.

DOCTOR X177
It's still contrasting so @@@.  Okay so when are you going to redo that?

PATIENT X177
Sometime uh.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@ about 30 days.

PATIENT X177
Right.

DOCTOR X177
And you just saw Ophtho on the 21st.

PATIENT X177
Right.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Yes.  So sometime next month, now I'm in the middle of next month.

DOCTOR X177
And you got your flu shot.

PATIENT X177
Yes.

DOCTOR X177
You need it every year.  Now have we ever asked you if you.

PATIENT X177
Correct.  You haven't been harassing at all.  You've been very polite about it.

DOCTOR X177
How about a pneumonia shot?

PATIENT X177
Nobody said anything about that.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah you should get a pneumonia vaccine.

PATIENT X177
Okay.  Is it going to make me sick?

DOCTOR X177
There's no live virus in it.

PATIENT X177
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X177
You'll get a local reaction and then @@@ and anytime you get a vaccine you'll just kind of feel a little.

PATIENT X177
Lethargic yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X177
And @@@ for a day or so.

PATIENT X177
I can live with that.

DOCTOR X177
So that's about it.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Um let's see so should get that and let's see colonoscopy.

PATIENT X177
That doesn't sound like fun.

DOCTOR X177
No but you're overdo for one.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Can you get one?

PATIENT X177
Set it up.  See how agreeable I am.

DOCTOR X177
You are.  You're like; I just really need to get my health in order right.

PATIENT X177
Yeah cause I mean I would like to be around a few more years.

DOCTOR X177
I think that's an excellent idea.

PATIENT X177
You know, uh let's see I got an Ear, Nose and Throat one day next week, no that's on the 4th I think.  Then I got a Psych evaluation on the 9th.  I got something else on the 15th.

SECOND PERSON X177
On the 15th.

DOCTOR X177
Okay and did you get the echo done too?

PATIENT X177
Yes, did I?

SECOND PERSON X177
Yes.

DOCTOR X177
Let me see that.  Uh you need to drop me a note if you want to go in earlier.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X177
Um he did do that @@@.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah I remember being with.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
You mean somebody didn't do their homework?  Go get em.

DOCTOR X177
Oh no, nothing happens that easily here.

PATIENT X177
This has got to be one of the smoothest operations I've seen in a while.  I mean short of being on base where the doctor only takes 10 seconds to get to you, this is a pretty good operation you all got here.

DOCTOR X177
I'm glad you think that.  Cause a lot of people hate the VA @@@.

PATIENT X177
Believe me it took me ten years to get in here, cause I they was all crazy over here.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
I haven't @@@.  The staff here and what I've had to deal with was easy.

DOCTOR X177
Good.

PATIENT X177
People are good people.  You know they talk to you if you've got some kind sense.

DOCTOR X177
Good.  Alright so you need med refills and I know you need to get the colonoscopy.  You need to, I don't see any echo results here, I don't know why.  But your EF is normal.  Your depth perception is normal.

PATIENT X177
What is that?

DOCTOR X177
It's how long your heart pumps blood out.

PATIENT X177
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X177
On the stress test.  I don't see any concern about that.  Um.

PATIENT X177
But they said I had a heart attack.

DOCTOR X177
It looks like you probably did have one in the past yeah.  It's what they call a fixed defect.

PATIENT X177
Well I didn't feel it.

SECOND PERSON X177
When you wrote it down, he used another word and @@@.

DOCTOR X177
Well and they don't know when that happens.  They said the findings likely represent a small fixed defect.  So if he did have one it was a very small one and I can't tell you when that happened.

SECOND PERSON X177
Hmm.

PATIENT X177
Could you tell me why it happened?  Yeah.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
That's true.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@ wasn't a diabetic that long ago.  They said even in the military he was not a diabetic.

PATIENT X177
Diabetic and I had a physical in 2004 and I wasn't diabetic.

DOCTOR X177
Right but you'd probably been diabetic for a while.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Even for a couple of years and you're a man over the age of 45.

PATIENT X177
There's no up side to getting old is there.

DOCTOR X177
Not really.  Besides eventually getting to retire.

PATIENT X177
Retirement would drive me crazy.  Sitting around doing nothing would definitely.

DOCTOR X177
You know it could have just happened.  It's very, very small.

SECOND PERSON X177
So small doesn't mean that it's not important.

DOCTOR X177
Right.

SECOND PERSON X177
I mean it's not a good, I just wondered if they would know that's a possibility of @@@.

DOCTOR X177
Right.

SECOND PERSON X177
Something is, something's making @@@ go up.

DOCTOR X177
Right.  Well you know to be honest they say that um, they say it's likely to represent a fixed defect, it just depends on the artifacts.  It's something that's there but doesn't mean anything.  So even on the reading they're not even 100% on that.  Cause it's pretty small and it's not reversible which means.

PATIENT X177
It's going to be there.

DOCTOR X177
The damage that is done is done, there's nothing to be done for that small area of the heart.  @@@ start over.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
And so right now @@@.

PATIENT X177
Try to avoid another one.

DOCTOR X177
Is to reduce your risk factors for any further heart disease.

SECOND PERSON X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ lowering the blood pressure, controlling the diabetes cause who knows how long his blood pressure has been a little high and with the diabetes and you're getting older and you know you carry all your weight right in the middle.

PATIENT X177
Right here.

DOCTOR X177
So you have what we could call um metabolic syndrome because your waist circumference is quite large, you have high blood pressure, diabetes, all of these things put you at increased risk for heart disease.

PATIENT X177
Okay.  So how do I lose the stomach, cause that's the only place I really need to lose any weight.  Need to lose any weight.  My pants are starting to falling off of me.  So I mean all my weight is right here.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah.

PATIENT X177
So I could lose, 10 of those, 20 of those.

DOCTOR X177
I really think @@@.  It just happens to be your body build.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
But your, that's where you carry your weight.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
You have skinny legs?

PATIENT X177
No I have thick @@@ legs.

DOCTOR X177
Let me see the back of your legs.  Your legs look skinny.

PATIENT X177
What, look right here.  @@@.

DOCTOR X177
So let's see um.  So your @@@ level was 13.

PATIENT X177
Yes.  She told me about that, we want to get it down to 7.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah.

PATIENT X177
Well below 7.

DOCTOR X177
And your PSA was 1.71.

PATIENT X177
What's that?

DOCTOR X177
That's the prostate-specific antigen.  It's a screening test for um.

SECOND PERSON X177
What was it, 1. what you say?

DOCTOR X177
1.71.

SECOND PERSON X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Now the last time it was 04, usually after 4 then we would send someone to go get a biopsy.

SECOND PERSON X177
Really.

DOCTOR X177
All this means is if the PSA does become higher um I would probably repeat it and see if it @@@ before we.

PATIENT X177
Yeah let's do that.  A biopsy sound like cutting and stuff.

DOCTOR X177
It does.

PATIENT X177
Yeah and that doesn't sound like fun.

DOCTOR X177
And you know that's part of the continuity of doing the PSA.  We have a lot of false positive.  We send a lot of men for biopsies that come back negative and the other thing is we find a lot of cancer that might ever materialize to anything.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Cause prostate cancer often times can be very, it's because there's @@@ and does nothing.

PATIENT X177
What is the prostate, what does it do?

DOCTOR X177
It secretes um a lot of stuff, like the hormone @@@ for men.  It sits right around your urethra and the ureters as they come in from the bladder to your penis.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
And so that's why when it gets enlarged @@@ all of your symptoms are @@@.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
You have increased risks of stroke.

PATIENT X177
Well I got that already.

DOCTOR X177
Hard time starting and stopping.

PATIENT X177
I don't have that.

DOCTOR X177
Um decreased flow, so the stream is slow.

PATIENT X177
No I don't have that.  I just go a lot.  But then I drink a lot too.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah if those things happen um you know they do have medication for that too.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X177
If his PSA was 1.71.

DOCTOR X177
0.71

SECOND PERSON X177
1.71.

DOCTOR X177
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X177
That was not a @@@ sign because it should be 0-4.

DOCTOR X177
That's the normal range.  I don't know what his PSA has been.

PATIENT X177
Before.

DOCTOR X177
Before.

SECOND PERSON X177
Oh.

DOCTOR X177
I can't really do anything unless it was like 16 or @@@.

SECOND PERSON X177
Hmm.

DOCTOR X177
I can't really do anything with a one time number of 1.71.  And @@@ but that's not recommended for everybody.  Being African-Americans is probably the reason why we continue to follow it closely because of the suggestion of increased aggressiveness in @@@ gender.

PATIENT X177
Hmm.

DOCTOR X177
So it's something that I do want to watch but like I said it's just one number.  You could have been 1.7 for the last ten years and that may have been definitely nothing.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
You know.  @@@.

PATIENT X177
But we don't worry about it.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ worry about.

PATIENT X177
Okay.  Well I'm leaving you in charge so far.  So far you been good, so I'm leaving you in charge.

DOCTOR X177
So your creatinine is great um.  The only thing that I would say that you need to.

PATIENT X177
Stop smoking and get my blood pressure under control.

DOCTOR X177
Well, I mean your cholesterol is beautiful.  I mean, I don't know that's probably been the best cholesterol I've seen for diabetics @@@.  So uh without medications, I mean it usually doesn't happen.  So you want to do, things that work in your favor but as I said it's all @@@.

PATIENT X177
@@@ and everything else.

DOCTOR X177
You know I know you're concerned about the heart test but really all the test was saying is that there's something you could @@@.  There is something that you can, it's reversible so if you needed surgery that this @@@.

PATIENT X177
I don't like either one of those words.

DOCTOR X177
But since it's not reversible we definitely have a lot to do.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ if you're symptoms arise, if you're breathing has increased shortness of breath from your baseline.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
Um @@@, chest pain is just really, in a diabetic if you live, you really need to prevent symptoms of heart disease.  If you have nausea, really bad indigestion, those are things that probably you shouldn't ignore because diabetics don't present the same way that the typical heart disease.  The things like chest and left arm pain.

PATIENT X177
So like I been @@@ just sometimes you know and you know.

DOCTOR X177
Right.

PATIENT X177
But they never last more than you know 15, 20 minutes.

SECOND PERSON X177
Sometimes the numbness.

PATIENT X177
The numbness.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah but the numbness can be just the neuropathy because of the diabetes too.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
And I don't know how long you've had it, how long you've had it, it's been really bad.  With having your blood sugar going into 400s @@@.

PATIENT X177
Well I been down to 200, pretty much.

DOCTOR X177
What have they been reading at home?

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.  I'd say averaging out at 195 unless @@@ something.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
No this we got when we saw the Pharmacy.  But it's running about 200 average.

DOCTOR X177
Still a lot higher than we want them.

PATIENT X177
No but they're a lot better than they were when I first came in here.

SECOND PERSON X177
You can help it.

PATIENT X177
I understand that's not good enough.  Give me credit for being improved.

SECOND PERSON X177
Yeah you improved okay.

DOCTOR X177
And you're on 12 units of Glargine in the morning.  @@@ right.

PATIENT X177
Yes.

DOCTOR X177
Are you on @@@.

PATIENT X177
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X177
He just started being on the Lantus.

PATIENT X177
When I came from the Pharmacy.

SECOND PERSON X177
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Yeah cause it was 10, then it was dropped to 8 and now it's pumped to 12.

SECOND PERSON X177

The podiatrist.

SECOND PERSON X177

DOCTOR X177
Unless she wants you to be referred to Surgery, I would.

PATIENT X177
No.

DOCTOR X177
Other than conservative management which.

SECOND PERSON X177
Conservative management what is that?

DOCTOR X177
With um nonsteroidals like over-the-counter ibuprofen.

PATIENT X177
Ibuprofen does nothing but give me a headache.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.  What about Aleve?

PATIENT X177
I got some of those.

DOCTOR X177
The anti-inflammatories are the best um.  You said had syringes and you needed strips?

PATIENT X177
Strips.  I got half a box of syringes.  The strips are almost gone.  I got like 7, 8 maybe 10.  

DOCTOR X177
@@@.  And then um you know I mean avoiding unnecessary trauma so.  Good to go upstairs, maybe not @@@ go down.

PATIENT X177
Hmm.

DOCTOR X177
Going upstairs at least gives you the benefit of the cardiac risks.

PATIENT X177
Yeah if you go up you got to get down.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah but you can take the elevator down.

PATIENT X177
Uh we don't have an elevator in the house.

DOCTOR X177
Oh well I mean when you're @@@.  Do we have any?

PATIENT X177
But if I went three blocks yesterday to get a pack of cigarettes.

DOCTOR X177
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X177
It's really not worth it.

DOCTOR X177
No.

PATIENT X177
The stress knocked up to go you know three blocks to get a pack cigarettes.

DOCTOR X177
Give me a deep breath in and out.

PATIENT X177
Yeah.

DOCTOR X177
Okay.  Which knee?

PATIENT X177

DOCTOR X177

PATIENT X177
They crack sometimes when I.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah it's called crepitus.  Go on and kick out.

SECOND PERSON X177
It's called what?

DOCTOR X177
Crepitus.

SECOND PERSON X177
Crepitus.

DOCTOR X177
Just a sign of uh.

PATIENT X177
Old age.

DOCTOR X177
Of osteoarthritis.

PATIENT X177
You got all kinds of nice things to say don't you.

DOCTOR X177
It's um; it's just one of those things that happens.

PATIENT X177
Yeah you getting old.

DOCTOR X177
You were in the military; you probably did a lot of physical activity.

PATIENT X177
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X177
And your knees are one of your weightbearing joints and so it's one of the first to go.

PATIENT X177
To go, like a load bearing wall in an apartment.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ and a lot of times when you do have knee issues you end up with hip issues because the way you walk.

PATIENT X177
You're just a fun person today aren't you.

DOCTOR X177
Oh.  So really taking anti-inflammatory medications like Aleve is a good thing to do.  We'll be watching your kidney function anyway because of the other medications that we have you on.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
So the things I'm going to need to do for you today is renew your meds, colonoscopy.

PATIENT X177
We're going to a colonoscopy today.

DOCTOR X177
Not today.

PATIENT X177
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X177
I'll put in a referral but you need to get labs, so what I'll probably have you do is get all those labs in about a month after you start taking the lisinopril.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
To make sure the lisinopril isn't doing anything to your kidneys.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Some people it does bump, does cause the kidney function to drop a bit.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Um but the benefits of the lisinopril in a diabetic outweigh that by a lot.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Um and then.

PATIENT X177
So I'll go down there and get that stuff.

DOCTOR X177
Well yeah, you can get that medication.  You already got your pneumonia vaccination.

PATIENT X177
No.

DOCTOR X177
You did.

PATIENT X177
I had a flu shot.

DOCTOR X177
No but it's in the chart, they recorded it.  You got it on the 20th of August.

PATIENT X177
Oh I did.

DOCTOR X177
You did.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
They snuck it in there without you even knowing.

PATIENT X177
Okay.  They snuck up on me.

DOCTOR X177
I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
@@@

(DOCTOR OUT:  52:57  DOCTOR IN:  65:04)

DOCTOR X177
Um and I spoke to DOCTOR and she preferred to defer the colonoscopy for right now until we get everything else.

PATIE X177
I need to get the labs done.

DOCTOR X177
Well just get everything else kind of under control too.  

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Um and then she wanted me to @@@.  Lisinopril I just wonder if we need it.  Did they have you discontinue it?

PATIENT X177
I never had it.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah, that's @@@.  I'm going to discontinue it.

PATIENT X177
So that's for the blood pressure.

DOCTOR X177
Well, yeah and I want to, I want to just reorder it so you can pick it up today.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X177
@@@.

PATIENT X177
Ah well, one thing nice about computer you can always override them.

DOCTOR X177
Sometimes.

PATIENT X177
No all the time.  There's a way to override it, trust me.  It might not like it but it can be overridden.  

DOCTOR X177
And then I need to, let's see.  I need to put in a non-formulary request for the Chantix and we were also discussing the patch with the Chantix and you need, um I'm as familiar.  Are you using the Wellbutrin @@@.

PATIENT X177
I ain't got depression.  I'm not depressed.

DOCTOR X177
Well it's something @@@ for the next few days.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
@@@ So my attending decided that Chantix is not your best @@@.

PATIENT X177
Okay that'll work.  Don't give me too many things to do at one time, I get confused.

DOCTOR X177
Yeah I can, let me see something.  No it won't let me do Chantix.  You know the VA has a lot of things that are kind of @@@.  It won't let me do Chantix unless you've tried up the nicotine patch.

PATIENT X177
Okay.  We'll do it the hard way.

DOCTOR X177
Do you want to try the patches?

SECOND PERSON X177
Are you talking about the Nicorette?  That's the best you got, cause I don't, that's the best you have?  That you we can get into.

DOCTOR X177

PATIENT X177
Whatever.  I trust you still.

DOCTOR X177
So.  That you need to get started right away.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
The patches.  But you need to stop smoking.  

SECOND PERSON X177
You know what I'm saying, you can't, you don't.

PATIENT X177
Chantix lets you go, no.

DOCTOR X177
The Chantix does but.

PATIENT X177
But the Nicorette doesn't.

DOCTOR X177
I think what it is a lot of medications that are newer or more expensive since there are @@@ last one.

PATIENT X177
Okay when am I going to see you again?

DOCTOR X177
In two months.

PATIENT X177
Okay so that'll be around Christmas.

DOCTOR X177

PATIENT X177
Okay @@@ we'll keep working at it.

DOCTOR X177
Um I'll probably order all the labs then so don't worry about labs today.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

DOCTOR X177
Um, yeah I’m sorry, I would, so what I'd say to you is that um I would try to get down to maybe like six cigarettes or so a day.

PATIENT X177
Well I'm down, like I say about half a pack.

DOCTOR X177
Get down to five or six cigarettes a day.  When you cut down to that, pick a stop day, stop and start using the patches.

PATIENT X177
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X177
So don't use the patches until.

DOCTOR X177

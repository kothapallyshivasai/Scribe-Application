PATIENT X547
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR X547
Uh your cholesterol looks okay.  You know your blood sugar looks like it's going a little bit high the last few times we've checked it.

PATIENT X547
Yes that's what they were telling me.

DOCTOR X547
So I mean it's not, it's not very high to the point where I think we need to start a medication but its right in that cusp of diabetes so we'll just try to keep an eye on what you're eating.

PATIENT X547

PATIENT X547
I was just reading this here, oh okay now @@@ vitamin C is 50 mg a day.

DOCTOR X547
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X547

DOCTOR X547
Right.

PATIENT X547
Uh-huh.  And so would that be too much for me.  

DOCTOR X547
Yeah because your dose is 500 mg.  So what I'm saying just do the three days before you do this.

PATIENT X547
Oh just don't take it huh.

DOCTOR X547
Yeah.

PATIENT X547
Oh okay, okay.

DOCTOR X547

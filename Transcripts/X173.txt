DOCTOR X173

PATIENT X173
My foot slipped off and I should have put some new springs on but I didn't. 

DOCTOR X173

PATIENT X173
@@@ right.

DOCTOR X173
Very good, very good.  The other one, very good.  Just checking your strength here, okay.  Alright now let me just take a look in your eyes.

SECOND PERSON X173
Did you have a @@@?

PATIENT X173
Yeah I had @@@ in the left eye @@@.

DOCTOR X173
Was it blurry?

PATIENT X173
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X173
He's doctoring that for a year now.  It had infection in the pupil.

DOCTOR X173
Okay alright.  Um close your eyes and let me know if you feel me touching you okay.

PATIENT X173
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

DOCTOR X173
Okay, alright good.  Well um the concern is always you know um whether or not you had a stroke. You know with symptoms like this.  @@@ you had some memory problems before.

PATIENT X173
Yeah.

DOCTOR X173
But @@@.

PATIENT X173
Yeah.

DOCTOR X173
Um and you have a fib, right irregular heart rhythm?

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X173
And you're not on Coumadin.

SECOND PERSON X173
No.

DOCTOR X173
And that increases the you know if you could have like a clot, a little clot forming in your heart, that's not, you know because your heart is not pumping regular.

PATIENT X173
Right.

DOCTOR X173
So that could have, you know went up to your brain and caused some you know memory problems.  So you know I think we should get a CAT scan, you know just to have to make sure there is nothing acute there.  Are you on daily aspirin though?

SECOND PERSON X173
Yes.

DOCTOR PERSON X173
And you have been fasting okay.  And uh okay.  So what I would do is continue taking this aspirin and uh we'll scan the head and see if there is anything new there that um.

PATIENT X173
I'll be lucky there is.

DOCTOR X173
Uh @@@ you know taking aspirin when you've already got some different medications but the um, the thing is.  Was it you that didn't want to do the Coumadin, no.

PATIENT X173
I don't even know what it is.  I've heard of it.

DOCTOR X173
Well it's a blood thinner.

PATIENT X173
Yeah.

DOCTOR X173
You know to make sure that your blood is thin enough so you don't forming the clots.

SECOND PERSON X173
See he had a buddy who @@@ and he was on Coumadin and he died in a pool of blood.  That's part of the reason he doesn't want to be on Coumadin.

PATIENT X173
Are you talking about @@@.

DOCTOR X173
Well I want to you about what DOCTOR talked to you about this a fib if you would be willing to be on Coumadin and you still don't want to be on Coumadin.  I mean um.

SECOND PERSON X173
I wonder if I should test for Alzheimer?

PATIENT X173
@@@.

DOCTOR X173
Oh this was kind of like one acute episode it would be like a transient ischemic attack, that's what it sounds like um and uh let's just first make sure that there is nothing acute like stroke going on now and then from, after that we would get a neuropsychiatry evaluation to see what else is going on.

SECOND PATIENT X173
Cause he usually knows all the questions.  I mean he's strong in his strength, just not on his like if the doctor asks him his date of birth and who's president and what day of the week you know.

PATIENT X173
But actually I couldn't think. Now I tell you I couldn't, no.

SECOND PERSON X173
You couldn't think yesterday.  I was surprised that I got the phone call and I stopped to think @@@ knew the phone number.

PATIENT X173
Well I had this paper that had it.

SECOND PERSON X173
That's what I wanted to, where can you get a bracelet or dog tags or something with contacts if something, like @@@.

DOCTOR X173
Oh, good question.  Um.

SECOND PERSON X173
This @@@ they know but.

DOCTOR X173
Let me check.

SECOND PERSON X173
I haven't asked the right person yet.

DOCTOR X173
I'll check on that okay.  Okay, I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X173
Okay.

DOCTOR X173
Alright.

PATIENT X173
Won't bother us.

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@

SECOND DOCTOR X173
PATIENT.

PATIENT X173
Hello.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Hey there, I'm DOCTOR.  I work with DOCTOR.

PATIENT X173
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Hi there, you must be Mrs. PATIENT.


SECOND PERSON X173
Hello.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
Me.  @@@.

PATIENT X173
Oh I don't know about that.  Get in the habit.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
First what do you remember?  What do you last remember?

PATIENT X173
Oh I don't know, I was driving and I didn't know where I was going and I just kept driving.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Uh-huh.  How did you know something was wrong?

PATIENT X173
Well I talked to him a little bit ago.  @@@ when we were first here so.  I don't know. I just kept going.  Where I was going I don't know that yet.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
But how did you know that something was wrong?

SECOND PERSON X173
But then you decided to walk your legs or was it when you decided you needed gasoline or was it because of your hunger?

PATIENT X173
Probably both uh but my legs, both of them was real numb.  I had @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Which side of your legs went numb?

PATIENT X173
I don't know which side really they just went numb and I went to lift the brake and slipped off and got between the brake and the foot pedal and I had a heck of a time getting my leg out of there.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Were you driving along without knowing it or did you stop and then.

PATIENT X173
No I kept driving but I stopped two or three times when my legs was numb and I walked.

SECOND PERSON X173
How did the young man find you that called me?

PATIENT X173
I found him and I said you have to @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Who called up you?

SECOND PERSON X173
A gentleman by the name of NAME and he was going to call me back but in the meantime instead of him calling me back then they let the police.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
What did they say?

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@.  They stopped and followed you down by the @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
How many miles is that from here?

SECOND PERSON X173
So they told him 75.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
And what did they say was wrong?  What did they notice?

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh I got more than.

PATIENT X173
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@.  Then @@@ called and DOCTOR called me and said I have your husband and he's alright but uh there's something wrong.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X173
And uh they @@@ that he hadn't had his medications yesterday morning and he due for medications in the evening at 7:30 last night and he was due for his medications in the evening and @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X173
And uh but we didn't know if he'd had anything to eat all day or not so he says I'm going to talk to him a bit and oh he said he was going to put him on I55 to head him back home.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Well what did they say was wrong though, I'm still not sure I understand?  Why, he just said there was somewhere here who's not sure why he's here or not sure how he got here or @@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
I know, @@@.

PATIENT X173
@@@ where I'd been.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
But you don't know.

SECOND PERSON X173
They didn't know.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Do you remember talking to someone at all?

SECOND PERSON X173
He didn't have anybody to talk to other than.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Okay, were you confused how you got there?

PATIENT X173
I didn't question it I just didn't know how I got there.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Has it ever happened to you before?

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X173
Not like that.

SECOND PERSON X173
Nothing like that, not that far away.  @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Tell me about what else has happened.

SECOND PERSON X173
Well we live about 5-8 blocks from a restaurant and he likes to go there and listen to the conversations with the guys you know and have a cup of coffee.  Some guys will have breakfast there.  So if he gets up early I know where he's going to but yesterday I didn't.  And I never did find out but then when I didn't call there to see if he had been there yesterday morning.  So he might have got up and got going to where he was going before I ever knew anything and normally if he leaves at 8, he'll come in about 10:30 and he didn't come in, I figured he'll be here for noon meal and it was all kind of busy so I decided to go out to eat.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
How long was all of this?

PATIENT X173
Yesterday.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Oh this was all yesterday.

SECOND PERSON X173
This was all yesterday.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
But what happened, but I thought this happened once before?

SECOND PERSON X173
Okay I'm good at mixing too.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X173
I was telling about the restaurant not being very far away so then he left the restaurant one day and he ended up some place in @@@ but I don't know where it was.

PATIENT X173
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
And got back home and um then the other time we were, I don't know what he was doing but he ended up down 59 going south and you ended up in @@@ but I had never been to that part of the city @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Have you had problems with memory?

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh.

PATIENT X173
Well my memory used to be wonderful.  I mean I could @@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
He remembers more back when than he does now and yesterday.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Have you had any problems with dementia?  Has anyone ever said you have dementia?

PATIENT X173
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
I don't know the difference between it and Alzheimer.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Well has anyone said that you have Alzheimer before?  

PATIENT X173
The doctor say you @@@ I don't know.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Have you felt your heart pounding at all?

PATIENT X173
Yeah I have a few times @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
When was the last time you felt your heart pounding?

PATIENT X173
Oh I don’t know, not very often.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Not very often.

SECOND PERSON X173
He always talks about getting a cramp.

PATIENT X173
Now you know what cramps are.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
What about that numb feeling in your legs?

PATIENT X173
I don't know it just goes numb.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
How often does that happen?

PATIENT X173
Oh @@@ around my feet and @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Do your arms ever go numb or just your legs?  Do your arms feel like they ever go numb or just your legs?

PATIENT X173
Well my arms will but I don't know about my hands or anything.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
You tell me about the numbness in his legs.

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@ numbness @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Yeah it's hard to know exactly what has happened @@@.  They found if you've been having some background memory problems and um.

PATIENT X173
Now I, my memory has just gone to heck.  I mean I can start from here to walk and I lost it you know.

SECOND PERSON X173
It's been 22 years since he's traveled anywhere out of the country and he's been talking like it was yesterday or last week.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
How long did the whole episode last?

SECOND PERSON X173
All day yesterday so.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
You didn't know that until you got the phone call from the police that he was 70 miles south?

SECOND PERSON X173
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Has his blood sugar ever run low?

PATIENT X173
It runs low.

SECOND PERSON X173
Once in a while.  When it runs low that's when he'll stick his finger but otherwise.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
By chance did you check it yesterday when you found him?

SECOND PERSON X173
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Okay can you take your glasses off for a second?  

SECOND PERSON X173
No because he was so hungry when he came in and he wanted to eat right away.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Open your eyes real big.  What happened to that left eye?

PATIENT X173
I had the wrong doctor work on them.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Has that pupil always been like that?

SECOND PERSON X173
Not quite as bad.

PATIENT X173
No the @@@ came off and it pulled apart and when they put it back in about two pieces.

SECOND PERSON X173
He lost the vitreous fluid and now.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Can you see out of that eye?

PATIENT X173
A little bit yes.

SECOND PERSON X173
He @@@ I don't know how much he can see but for the last year now they've been doctoring him for inflammation @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Open your mouth please.  Say ah.

PATIENT X173
Ah.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
@@@.  Does your face look a little different to you?

PATIENT X173
Oh I don't feel like it.

SECOND PERSON X173
I don't think he looks, I'd really have to say the whole @@@ of the face.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Does this side look a little different to you?

PATIENT X173
The left eye is always like that.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
@@@?

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Okay can you @@@.  Are you able to walk at all?

PATIENT X173
Oh yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Let's have you walk today.  

PATIENT X173
I've been a little more tipsy lately in getting my balance, I know that.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Hmm.

PATIENT X173
@@@.  

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Do you always walk with a cane?

PATIENT X173
Yes now.

SECOND PERSON X173
Oh he can forget that cane and he can look for it.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Let's have you take a couple steps for me.

SECOND PERSON X173
For a half an hour before he can find it.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Have you lost any control of your bowel or your bladder?

PATIENT X173
Oh yes off and on yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Is that a new problem?

FIRST DOCTOR X173
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Which?

SECOND PERSON X173
No it's not new.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Alright.  Just relax.  

PATIENT X173
You better get a bigger hammer than that now.

SECOND PERSON X173
There's no knee cap there.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
What happened there?

SECOND PERSON X173
Oh the VA took it off and forgot to put it back in, @@@ years ago.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Uh-huh.  I want you to squeeze my fingers.  Now look this way, look the other way, now back.  I don't think he's as strong as there.  @@@.  Oh we'll give DOCTOR a call, your doctor.  It's hard to know cause you don't really know what happened and that makes us a little concerned and as you know you have risk factors to have a stroke and/or what we call a warning sign for a stroke like a TIA and it could not be, this all could just be memory problems or something more longstanding but with the numbness in your leg and not knowing what's going on, I would agree with DOCTOR to get a scan of his head, a CAT scan and it would probably make more sense to send you to the Emergency Room um where they can get the scan of the head and ask Neurology to see you okay, to make sure that nothing else needs to be done.  There are a couple of things that we'd be worried about.  Um so I think that's what I recommend doing now.  I know depending on how busy they are that could be, if you've gone there before its several hours in the ER you know but it's the safest.

SECOND PERSON X173
That's why he started @@@ today.  We had been to Podiatry this morning and talking with a girl there and she said you're going to see a doctor before you leave, prior to doing the clinic and if you can't you go to the Emergency and I'm going to follow up you've got to do something today.

PATIENT X173
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X173
So we brought him in.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Yeah there's a reason why, I mean but the nice thing is we can get all this expedited which we can't do here.  So what do you think about that?

SECOND PERSON X173
Let's do it.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Okay.  We have to give the docs a call to let them know you're coming and what you now we want them to do for you.

PATIENT X173
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
And uh, I just think it's going to be good for you okay.

PATIENT X173
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X173
You're just wanting to help so I agree.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Yeah.  Alright we'll get them going on it.

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@ we about got him there at 1 o'clock last night and @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
Alright.

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X173
It makes the most sense for you okay so.

PATIENT X173
Okay. I can get ready to go.

SECOND PERSON X173
We'll go on to Emergency.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
Down to Emergency Room.

PATIENT X173
Now?

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR 277
Uh-huh.  I'll give them a call and see if @@@ but um, but uh they'll be able to do a CAT scan much faster than we do, you need to @@@ and then you coming back again and uh then Neurology folks can see you there.

PATIENT X173
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
And do a neurological examination okay.

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
Alright.

PATIENT X173
I hope.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
I'm making @@@.

PATIENT X173
Oh while you doing that, I really needed to say @@@.  What @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
This one?  

PATIENT X173
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
@@@ that's nothing.

PATIENT X173
Oh well then you can have it.

SECOND PERSON X173
He says that he wanted to, they never @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
Yeah it's @@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
Alright.  I'm going to visit with the doctor so they'll know why you're there alright.

SECOND PERSON X173
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
@@@.

PATIENT X173
I told the nurse, I had a hang nail on that big toe.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X173
They could take it out; the dumb thing seems to hurt.  I had some antibiotic salve I put on it.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X173
And it seemed like that @@@ thing now @@@ I don't know.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
Well tell them in the Emergency Room as well.  They can give you some pain medication.

PATIENT X173
Yeah okay.

SECOND PERSON X173
They can probably put the salve on now.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X173
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X173
@@@.

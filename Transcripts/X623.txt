PATIENT X623
Oh.

DOCTOR X623
It's like it really never goes away.

PATIENT X623
Really.  That's all.

DOCTOR X623
It never completely goes away.

PATIENT X623
I was gonna ask you if that's a birthmark.

DOCTOR X623
No I hate it though but if you look right where I cross my legs, it's exactly there.

PATIENT X623
And it's there forever?

DOCTOR X623
There forever and I feel like.

PATIENT X623

DOCTOR X623
Uh I'm DOCTOR.  I think you normally see um DOCTOR.

PATIENT X623

DOCTOR X623
He is on call today so he's not going to be here, so I'm filling in for him.  How you doing?

PATIENT X623
Pretty good.

DOCTOR X623
Looks like you were just here about a month ago.

PATIENT X623
Yeah, same thing.  Well it is the same thing that I want to tell you about.

DOCTOR X623
Sure.

PATIENT X623
I got kind of like a virus and they've been watching it because of my condition.

DOCTOR X623
Right.

PATIENT X623
@@@.

DOCTOR X623
@@@ yeah.

PATIENT X623
I've been through a lot.

DOCTOR X623
You sure have.  So you're not @@@ at all.

PATIENT X623
I think I caught, I got wet about three weeks ago in the rain.

DOCTOR X623
Yes.

PATIENT X623
And uh I all this was gone, coughing, sneezing everything was gone and they all came back.

DOCTOR X623
Okay.

PATIENT X623
And now I hurt, I'm not hurting now.

DOCTOR X623
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X623
But when the pain starts you know in this area over here, it hurts and I have to drop a Vicodin and uh my stomach, I been having a lot of problems down in my stomach, with all these changes of the GI.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah because of the GI yeah.

PATIENT X623
But uh they said, it's too dangerous to be putting that scope down there.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah.

PATIENT X623
But someday it got to be done cause this stomach irritated it but I think I caught a virus because it's always growling.

DOCTOR X623
@@@.

PATIENT X623
And I ignores it.

DOCTOR X623
Alright.

PATIENT X623
And I got diarrhea and had it for two weeks.

DOCTOR X623
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X623
It's not diarrhea, diarrhea but it's not normal.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X623
And they got me on Maalox but I just changed from the @@@ you know my physical lung therapy.

DOCTOR X623
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X623
And they said that Maalox will give you irregular bowel movements.

DOCTOR X623
Let's do this, let’s try to go off the Maalox okay.

PATIENT X623
Oh, what do we do about the pain?

DOCTOR X623
Well Maalox, so we can do, you're on a PPI twice a day right?

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
Try just doing that, we can cover the diarrhea on the side cause I don't know if this pain is coming from your lung @@@.

PATIENT X623
Yeah I'm gonna lose weight by having this diarrhea.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah, yeah and I think you have to pick which one's worse but I think I don't need you having diarrhea and losing a lot of weight you know.

PATIENT X623
Yeah.  I just keep up that way you know.

DOCTOR X623
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT X623
That chicken @@@ and I don't want to lose it back.

DOCTOR X623
No, no, no.  So let's go off the Maalox, at least back off to every other day.

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
And see if that helps you at all.  Um you're taking.

PATIENT X623
It start with a O.

DOCTOR X623
Um omeprazole.

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
And you're taking twice a day right?  So go easy on that, that'll help protect your stomach and then the 5 of Maalox back off to twice a day.  You're not taking the @@@ are you?

PATIENT X623
What is that?

DOCTOR X623
There's two medications that are stool softeners, you're not taking them?

PATIENT X623
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR X623
Cause if you @@@.  It happens a lot, in the hospital we wonder why patients have diarrhea and you look at what the @@@.

PATIENT X623
No, I stopped immediately.

DOCTOR X623
Okay good, good.

PATIENT X623
Okay but uh you don't think it's a virus when it keep growling like that?

DOCTOR X623
No you know it could be a little bit of a virus but the thing is if you are having diarrhea and it's causing a little bit of virus and you're flushing all your food out of you so you're gonna have a little more like almost a hunger pain.

PATIENT X623
Oh.

DOCTOR X623
So that's where the growling could be.

PATIENT X623
Okay.

DOCTOR X623
So um I'd say back off the Maalox to every other day for now and just see if that helps the diarrhea at all okay.

PATIENT X623
I was gonna say maybe I took that medication @@@ again.

DOCTOR X623
Right.  Now as far as pain on the right, it's you know.

PATIENT X623
But they say I'll probably have that the rest of my life.

DOCTOR X623
Rest of your life yeah.

PATIENT X623
Cause I'm so tore up inside.

DOCTOR X623
And well you've had quite the experiences um.

PATIENT X623
Yeah.

DOCTOR X623
With all @@@ and everything.  I know you had part of a lung taken out.

PATIENT X623
Yeah.

DOCTOR X623
So a lot of times that sort of pain doesn't resolve you know for a long time.

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
Um okay.  Let's see and you saw Pulmonary um, you saw the lung doctors recently.  You've seen lung and GI um and how and then how long have you been on the oxygen.  How long have you had it?

PATIENT X623
Uh I think, now I'm good, I'm all good when I'm sitting down but when I'm walking.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah.

PATIENT X623
I got to have it.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah okay.  Yeah it says this right here you're saturation on room air just while sitting is 95 but you drop down into the 80s and normal is 99 to 100 and you drop down pretty low when you start walking so um yeah.  You know @@@ thing @@@ they couldn't give you a smaller tank so?

PATIENT X623
Well they, when I go back next month.

DOCTOR X623
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X623
They gonna put @@@.

DOCTOR X623
How many liters in one?

PATIENT X623
Huh?

DOCTOR X623
Just one liter?

PATIENT X623
Here, I can't go a long ways, from 5, to 3 to 2.

DOCTOR X623
Wow. 

PATIENT X623
@@@.

DOCTOR X623
Good for you.  You're heading in the right direction.

PATIENT X623
But they said I'll probably be dealing with this the rest of my life because I ran out of nothing when I'm walking.

DOCTOR X623
Exactly you know.  Can you tell the difference in your @@@, do you feel better?

PATIENT X623
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X623
Yeah.

DOCTOR X623
Um otherwise I mean that, I know DOCTOR had gotten some lab tests.  Your cholesterol was perfect.  Colonoscopy we're not doing until 2012 and then as far as your follow-up with GI @@@ stay hydrated with Gatorade, @@@, that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
@@@ on you and then back off the Maalox to every other day.

PATIENT X623
Okay.

DOCTOR X623
Um blood pressure looks perfect.  Your prostate looks good as of last July, so things are looking good there.  Um any fevers or chills at home?

PATIENT X623
No.

DOCTOR X623
Okay.  And any coughing?

PATIENT X623
Yeah a little bit.

DOCTOR X623
Okay.  Um is this typical for you?  Do you normally cough?

PATIENT X623
Yeah every now and then @@@.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X623
It's time summer's coming in now.

DOCTOR X623
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X623
The change in the weather it's affecting everybody.

DOCTOR X623
I was just gonna say it throws everybody off.  Um your diabetes is really well controlled.

PATIENT X623
Yeah oh I'm careful of that.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah, stress can happen um and then one other thing the glaucoma, do you follow with the?  Do you have glaucoma in the eyes?

PATIENT X623
Yeah.

DOCTOR X623
Do you follow with the ophthalmologist, the eye doctors?

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
Okay.  Just to make sure you're seeing them.

PATIENT X623
Right, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
It looks like you do a very good job.  You're probably one of the best patients I've seen.

PATIENT X623
Yeah I don't want to go back.

DOCTOR X623
You don't want to stay @@@ no.

PATIENT X623
I don't want to go backwards, uh uh, I had a rough time, the last since 2007 it's been rough.  You know occasionally you have to take care of yourself, not the doctors; the patient himself has to take care of himself.

DOCTOR X623
I agree.  It's a team effort.

PATIENT X623
Yeah that's right.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah and that's what I walked into a patient's room the other day and I said you know what brings you in here, can't you read my damn chart, I said no and I was like well.

PATIENT X623
That's why we got a computer.

DOCTOR X623
And I just said listen I can read your chart all day but you know it's not the same as me talking to you know and he then did calm down a little bit.  @@@.  Um alright uh you look like you're doing a great job.

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
So let's just back-off on the, do you need any med refills or?

PATIENT X623
No I just called them in.

DOCTOR X623
Okay you called them in today.

PATIENT X623
I just called them in today.

DOCTOR X623
And you don't need to get labs and you're up-to-date on things.  Let me go run this by DOCTOR and then.  How often do you come back?  Do you come every month or do you come?

PATIENT X623
No, no he just wanted to see how I'm doing because you know I was feeling kind of bad.

DOCTOR X623
Right, right.  Well good.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X623
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  16:57  DOCTOR IN:  20:54)

DOCTOR X623
Alright sir.  Now are you, okay, so here's what I kind of want to do.  This is sort of difficult but I wanted to send the um stool studies to make sure that there's no infection in your stool.

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
Um so that would mean you'd have to go over and give them a sample.  Well actually, can you go do it right now?  You know it's not easy.  It's not like they can just take your blood you know you have to.

PATIENT X623
Well they can give me that thing.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah.

PATIENT X623
And I could bring it back.  I can do that.

DOCTOR X623
Okay.  Why don't we do that?  Um, we'll go do that.  

PATIENT X623
Yeah.

DOCTOR X623
Let me set everything up and we'll just make sure there's no infection in there.

PATIENT X623
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X623
Um.

PATIENT X623
Let me ask you something too.

DOCTOR X623
Sure.

PATIENT X623
I know it's in my lungs and all that I've been through but you know I feel tired all the time and I take vitamins every day too.  Is there something I could, is there a vitamin that I could take to make me feel more.

DOCTOR X623
Um @@@ not so much and you know the first thing I think of when somebody says they're tired all the time is anemic you know.

PATIENT X623
I don't think I'm anemic.

DOCTOR X623
And you're not.  Now the next thing I look at is do you have a thyroid problem, you is there something wrong with your thyroid so that would be tested.  You were just checked in October and your thyroid looks perfect so if anything you know with the oxygenation yeah.

PATIENT X623
That's it.

DOCTOR X623
And um that's probably a lot of it you know um your body uses the increased energy source.

PATIENT X623
Breathing.

DOCTOR X623
@@@.  

PATIENT X623
Something I got to deal with it I guess.

DOCTOR X623
Yes.  So you basically want me to do that, right you want to.  So we'll do three different stool studies and you bring them in and we'll see what happens and go over there and meet you to go over them.

PATIENT X623
Right.  I @@@.  Now I do have to go over and get these from them.

DOCTOR X623
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X623
You put in that now right?

DOCTOR X623
Yep I just put it in.  Um so how often do you normally, you want to come back in say two months?

PATIENT X623
Uh there's this @@@ you want, see I @@@.

DOCTOR X623
And then you know, yeah exactly.

PATIENT X623
@@@.

DOCTOR X623
That puts you to see DOCTOR in June.  Just cause of all the stuff going on with you, a lot of times I let patients go a little longer than that but with all the stuff around here and your lungs and stuff I think you should come back in a few weeks. 

PATIENT X623
Okay.

DOCTOR X623
Otherwise I think everything's good.  We'll get your stuff ordered, got the cups and then we'll see you in a month.

PATIENT X623
Okie doke.

DOCTOR X623
Alright.

PATIENT X623

DOCTOR X623

PATIENT X623

DOCTOR X623

PATIENT X623

DOCTOR X623

PATIENT X623

DOCTOR X623

PATIENT X623

PATIENT X589
Hmm.  They usually.

DOCTOR X589
Do you ever go below 60?

PATIENT X589
No, no.  The closest I got was like 65 one time.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.

PATIENT X589
And that's when like I didn't eat that night.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  Um how is your gout?

PATIENT X589
It flares up from time to time.

DOCTOR X589
When was the last flare?

PATIENT X589
A couple of weeks ago.

DOCTOR X589
Oh really?

PATIENT X589
Hmm.

DOCTOR X589
Did you take the allopurinol for it?

PATIENT X589
I ran out of that.

DOCTOR X589
Did you get the colchicine?

PATIENT X589
Yeah I had the colchicine yeah when it flares I take the colchicine.

DOCTOR X589
And you managed the flare completely without using the allopurinol right?

PATIENT X589
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Where do normally get the gout?

PATIENT X589
Uh right big toe.  See in the left.

DOCTOR X589
Do you have any swelling there?  It's not anywhere in your foot?

PATIENT X589
Usually it's in the left big toe.  Sometimes it's you know, it moves over to the right foot, seems like in the middle of the foot seems like but mostly it's in the left big toe.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  I have a question, your diabetes has not been controlled for a while um, we were going to follow up on the hemoglobin A1c and on here it was well controlled and here it's relatively controlled the whole time.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
But the last one was in the summer was 8.3.  We want it ideally to be less than 7.

PATIENT X589
Right.

DOCTOR X589
Are you checking your blood sugar only once a day or two hours after you eat or before you eat?

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh you know I just recently started doing the two hours after cause I was doing it like right after I eat and wait an hour after I eat.

DOCTOR X589
Okay so if you're gonna take it after you've eaten, do it two hours after you eat.

PATIENT X589
Yeah.

DOCTOR X589
I'd rather you check it before you eat and see how its running during the middle of the day.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Um and likely you're only taking metformin right for diabetes?

PATIENT X589
And glipizide.

DOCTOR X589
Oh you are taking glipizide.

PATIENT X589
Yes, I need a refill on that twice a day.

DOCTOR X589
So how much glipizide?

PATIENT X589
Uh a tablet and a half.

DOCTOR X589
10, 20 mg, 50 mg?

PATIENT X589
Uh can't remember which one it is.  I know I take a pill and a half a day.

DOCTOR X589
Oh okay, so you're taking 50 mg.  When did you stop taking that?

PATIENT X589
I hadn't stopped taking it unless I run out of it.

DOCTOR X589
Oh really.

PATIENT X589
Yeah.  When I was here last week they told me to stop taking the colchicine.

DOCTOR X589
Oh you were taking it pretty consistently?

PATIENT X589
Yeah.

DOCTOR X589
You were taking the colchicine and allopurinol?

PATIENT X589
At one point I was.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.

PATIENT X589
Hmm.

DOCTOR X589
So that was stopped.

PATIENT X589
Hmm.

DOCTOR X589
Colchicine and allopurinol.  Per month or per year how many episodes do you get while on the allopurinol?

PATIENT X589
Oh man I'd say about three.

DOCTOR X589
So that's three episodes a year?

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh about that.  Sometimes it seems like a little more but.

DOCTOR X589

DOCTOR X589
Okay so the last time you saw Podiatry was a long time ago.

PATIENT X589

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  I'll enter it.  Do you take hydrochlorothiazide too?

PATIENT X589
No they told me to stop taking that.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.

PATIENT X589
That was a couple of weeks ago.

DOCTOR X589
And you're checking your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X589
Yes.

DOCTOR X589
And it's running pretty good?

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Okay so we should talk about the @@@ so they're probably just gonna watch you.  The ultrasound looks okay.  Um we're gonna check, so we can check AFP, UA, PTT, @@@.  Are you taking the high dose vitamin B, the ergocalciferol?  

PATIENT X589
Right.  But I just started that.

DOCTOR X589
You just started that?

PATIENT X589
Yeah I think I've taken the second one.  Well I've taken one or two and this will be like the third one tomorrow, it's the third time I just got started.

DOCTOR X589

DOCTOR X589
Oh you were in the Gold Clinic?

PATIENT X589
This was last week I was there.

DOCTOR X589

PATIENT X589
Over in the Gold Clinic.  That's why I hadn't been over here in a while.

DOCTOR X589
Oh okay the last appointment was @@@.  

PATIENT X589
Now last week they was telling me something about magnesium.

DOCTOR X589
Yeah your magnesium is low.  Are you taking your potassium?

PATIENT X589
I haven't had it, I haven't got anything.

DOCTOR X589
Okay well we'll refill it okay.  Um they did order it for you.

PATIENT X589
Hmm I haven't received it yet.

DOCTOR X589
Oh really.  

PATIENT X589
Now certain food, does all food have magnesium or certain foods have magnesium?

DOCTOR X589
Well I know what foods have potassium; I don't know what food has magnesium.

PATIENT X589
Magnesium.  Cause the way it was explained to me it was something like uh I'm not getting enough magnesium through my food or something and so I didn't know what foods have magnesium.

DOCTOR X589
Um you're kind of low, just take supplements.

PATIENT X589
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  Um so that's done and then okay so today we need labs okay.  

PATIENT X589
Again, I did labs last week.

DOCTOR X589
Let me go to the hospital, so we don't need some of the labs, this you got so that's good.  Um but you do need.  You need refills of all your meds?

PATIENT X589
I need refills on the glipizide.

DOCTOR X589
Okay and metformin?

PATIENT X589
Metformin I think I'm pretty good on.

DOCTOR X589
You need a refill?

PATIENT X589
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X589
Oh any test strips?

PATIENT X589
Uh yes.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  Rosuvastatin?

PATIENT X589
I think I just got that.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.

PATIENT X589
Recently yeah.

DOCTOR X589
Allopurinol?

PATIENT X589
Uh.

DOCTOR X589
@@@.  

PATIENT X589
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X589
So you need that.

PATIENT X589
Yeah.

DOCTOR X589
I would try to stay away from colchicine.

PATIENT X589
Hmm.

DOCTOR X589
If you get gout we can give you some prednisone for kidney function.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
But um I'll leave that to DOCTOR okay.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.  So you're saying that the uh colchicine that's uh.

DOCTOR X589
It can hurt the kidneys.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  Um that's why you're not a client for @@@ therapy.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
But um if you get an attack um well we'll give you some prednisone.

PATIENT X589
That's a steroid isn't it?

DOCTOR X589
Uh-huh.  Yeah @@@.  Let me talk to DOCTOR about it okay.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Um lisinopril right?

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Do you want them mailed?

PATIENT X589
Yeah by mail.

DOCTOR X589
Or you want them at the window?

PATIENT X589
No. It takes too long.

DOCTOR X589
Oh does it?

PATIENT X589
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.

PATIENT X589
When you come back tomorrow I'll still be there waiting to get it.

DOCTOR X589
Oh, now.  Oh okay.

PATIENT X589
And the, did they say anything about the magnesium?

DOCTOR X589
Yes.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Okay for the gout.  I think what you need to do is check your sugars in the middle of the day.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Um and see, do you think you're sugars on the whole have been improving or just have been staying the same?

PATIENT X589
I'd say half and half.  I think they're improving but I mean I haven't, the highest I ever seen was like 180.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  So one of the other thing is the glipizide um you know you should check your sugars in the middle of the day and come back for an appointment cause.

PATIENT X589
Hmm.

DOCTOR X589
I think we need to see what happens.  Your diabetes has been uncontrolled but it improved slightly since June but every three months that's for the control for every three months.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
So you probably do have to go up on the glipizide.  When did you start the glipizide?

PATIENT X589
Oh it's been a while, at least a couple years I think.

DOCTOR X589
Really.

PATIENT X589
Yeah.

DOCTOR X589
Why didn't they increase the @@@?  Maybe they wanted to see if it got any better.  Um how would you feel about injecting yourself with insulin?

PATIENT X589
No.

DOCTOR X589
You won't?

PATIENT X589
No.

DOCTOR X589
Not under any circumstances?

PATIENT X589
No.

DOCTOR X589
No.  Um and is there a reason why?

PATIENT X589
Well one I don't want to and the other part is I drive truck if I'm shooting insulin I can't drive.  I'm a truck driver.

DOCTOR X589
Hmm.  What if we increase the glipizide as much as we can and there are two drugs for oral?

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
For diabetes and if they show control.

SECOND PERSON X589
But when you said insulin.

DOCTOR X589
I can always increase this and see how you do.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Um but the control of the diabetes is really, really important.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
To be you know in terms of your legs and @@@ complications.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
That's why we really want your diabetes controlled.  It hasn't gotten any better and I'll talk to DOCTOR and see okay.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Um any changes in your vision?  Changes in the sensation in your legs?  

PATIENT X589
No.

DOCTOR X589
Chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X589
No.

DOCTOR X589
No.  Increased fluid, retention?

PATIENT X589
Just fat.  Fat that's all.

DOCTOR X589
@@@.  Okay.  Can you lean forward for me please sir?  Deep breath out again out.  Okay, do you smoke?

PATIENT X589
No.

DOCTOR X589
Have you ever?

PATIENT X589
Never.

DOCTOR X589
Very good.  Let me see you have any swelling.  No swelling at all.  Open your mouth for me.  Alright @@@.  Good.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  26:59  DOCTOR IN:  47:17)

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  So here's the thing.  The best thing to do is @@@ allopurinol.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  Um we're gonna restart you back on the colchicine cause colchicine can really prevent attacks.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
But that's usually good up to like six months and I'm also gonna send you to Renal and Rheumatology.  Um and Rheumatology because of this recurrent gout to see if there's any other medications they can put you on.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  And to see you have to continue the colchicine um so just 0.6 mg per day.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  If you don't want to go off of the colchicine before you see Rheumatology that's up to you.

PATIENT X589
How long will it take to see Rheumatology?

DOCTOR X589
Huh?

PATIENT X589
How long will it take for that appointment?

DOCTOR X589
Um to be really honest I don't know.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
I don't think it'll be entirely long I think I mean its Rheumatology, I think they should be able to see you hopefully soon.  Um what I'll do is I'm going to follow up, I'll put the consult in and I'll say @@@ in a month.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  So you can see them and see how that goes.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
And then I also want you to see the kidney doctors.

PATIENT X589
Hmm.

DOCTOR X589
To make sure everything is stable and to investigate why you're having, what is causing this insufficiency of your kidneys.  Oh shoot.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:52  DOCTOR IN:  49:17)

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  Um so there's various things that can cause kidney disease one is uncontrolled diabetes.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
One is high blood pressure gets out of control and your blood pressure was controlled.  One is recurrent gout.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
Um but I want you to see the kidney doctors so they can watch you and prevent any further progression.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Okay um and what I'm gonna do for your diabetes is increase the glipizide.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
From 1 1/2 to 2 tablets.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
Okay.  You'll go 20 mg um after that, I'll double check but after that um if when DOCTOR rechecks the hemoglobin A1c we may have to consider insulin but we'll see what happens okay.

PATIENT X589
Okay.

DOCTOR X589
I know it's tough but maybe you can stop on the side and stop if its.  We just want to prevent any further complications from happening.

PATIENT X589
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X589
And hopefully @@@.  

SECOND PERSON X589
@@@.

DOCTOR X589
@@@.  Oh my goodness alright, okay.  Okay so I'll look and see, okay let's do that.  Oh so you only use the 1/2 tablets once daily.

PATIENT X589

PATIENT X589
Well it ends up being yeah, but I'll take.

DOCTOR X589
All day long.

PATIENT X589

Do you have like @@@ on your toe or anything or any like crystals in your toe?  I @@@ figure it out now.  And then we'll refer you to the Renal Clinic, Rheumatology, I'll renew the colchicine.  Do you want your um medicines mailed?

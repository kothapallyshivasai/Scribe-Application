All my life.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.

PATIENT X31
All my life.  No I was born right here in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X31
No kidding, right down the street huh.

PATIENT X31
Right down the street.  When I came back out of service I moved to xxx with my wife cause I married her while I was in service and uh we looked around, we lived with my mother-in-law and father-in-law for 3 1/2 years.  We were looking for a place to buy.  So we finally found a place and then we took the two of them with em, they went with us.

DOCTOR X31
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X31
There was a couple of rooms finished off in the basement in the house we bought.  They were with me for over 20 some years.

DOCTOR X31
Wow.  Was that here in xxx xxx?

PATIENT X31
No xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.

PATIENT X31
They were living in xxx and we lived with them for 3 1/2 years.

DOCTOR X31

Then when we went to xxx xxx in 1948 and I've been there ever since.

DOCTOR X31
Alright wow.

PATIENT X31
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X31
You stayed all within the same area pretty much.

PATIENT X31
Four bedrooms, three baths, outdoor diving pool.

DOCTOR X31

DOCTOR X31
Oh my gosh.

PATIENT X31
They're a pet @@@.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.

PATIENT X31
And I can't stand it.  Those damn birds, they scream at the top of their voice.  I don't like that.

DOCTOR X31
I don't either.  I'm not into that.

PATIENT X31
I like peace and quiet.

DOCTOR X31
So how you feeling overall?

PATIENT X31
Well, I have two little items I would like to mention.

DOCTOR X31
Sure.

PATIENT X31
One of them is my throat.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.

PATIENT X31
I used to sing a lot and uh lately if, now I'm singing in church too.

DOCTOR X31
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X31
And uh sometimes when I sing it irritates my throat.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.

PATIENT X31
I was just wondering if I ought to see a throat specialist.

DOCTOR X31
Are you getting pain when you swallow?

PATIENT X31
Sometimes without any, without any reason it kind of irritates a little bit.

DOCTOR X31
Um, how long has this been going on?

PATIENT X31
Oh just recently.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
So it's been going on for several days in a row or does it come and go kind of?

PATIENT X31
Oh, well sometimes, no it's longer than a few days uh.  Occasionally I get hoarse and even when I'm talking to my daughter on the phone, she dad, what's the matter with your voice and she notices the irregularity.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.

PATIENT X31
Right now it's, not, it's not quite the pitch that it usually is.

DOCTOR X31
Um has this been like for, I guess what I'm trying to ask you is this just something kind of coming over or like has it been there for a while now?

PATIENT X31
No it comes and goes.

DOCTOR X31
Okay, so it's not like uh.

PATIENT X31
Not like a constant.

DOCTOR X31
I gotcha.  Um any, so no real pain, you're able to swallow food okay for the most part?

PATIENT X31
Oh no, no, no, uh.  I still have my tonsils I don't know if that's any indication.

DOCTOR X31
Do you have any ear pain?

PATIENT X31
No.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  Any headaches with this?

PATIENT X31
No.

DOCTOR X31
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X31
No.

DOCTOR X31
Any coughing at all?

PATIENT X31
Occasionally but not too much. 

DOCTOR X31
Uh day or night that you're coughing?

PATIENT X31
Mostly day.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  Have you had allergies?

PATIENT X31
Uh, well they treated me for allergies down here but I think it was, I think it was a dust allergy that I got when I was working up cleaning out my attic.

DOCTOR X31
Oh yeah, okay um.  Yeah you had medication for that at this point.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Have you been around anyone who's been sick?

PATIENT X31
Pardon?

DOCTOR X31

PATIENT X31
No.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.

PATIENT X31
No.

DOCTOR X31
Alright.  Okay, well let's take a look and kind of see @@@.

PATIENT X31
Uh, the other thing I was thinking about was tingling feet and legs.  It started recently.

DOCTOR X31
Okay how long ago?

PATIENT X31
Oh two months.

DOCTOR X31
Which uh, is it both feet?

PATIENT X31
Both feet.

DOCTOR X31
What part of your feet?

PATIENT X31
Well right now I can feel a little tingling in the feet.  Sometimes it goes up as high as this.

DOCTOR X31
Okay and is it exactly the same on the other side too?

PATIENT X31
Both the same.

DOCTOR X31
Any trouble walking?

PATIENT X31
Well, diabetic, sometimes I have trouble with my balance you know, but uh other than that why uh no I can.
DOCTOR X31
@@@ diabetic, how long have you had diabetes for?

PATIENT X31
Oh since 1981.  Yeah since '81.

DOCTOR X31
You're still on uh NPH 17 units?

PATIENT X31
Uh I make it 18 cause it's easier to hit in the in the needle.

DOCTOR X31
Okay and how have your sugars been at home?

PATIENT X31
Pardon?

DOCTOR X31
Your blood sugars at home?

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
How have they been?

PATIENT X31
Alright.

DOCTOR X31
What numbers are you getting?

PATIENT X31
Oh, it's usually blood pressure runs anywhere from the 130s to the 150s.  

DOCTOR X31
That's a little bit higher than before right?

PATIENT X31
Pardon?

DOCTOR X31
That's a bit higher than prior.

PATIENT X31
Yeah a little bit higher.  I'm getting ready to send in for a refill on my hydrochlorothiazide.  I've got about 30 days left.  Lisinopril you sent me.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.  Uh you also have protein in your urine as well and we had both of those, I know lisinopril is one and there's another medicine that's kind of diabetes management.  Um okay.  You want to have a seat up here for me?

PATIENT X31
Oh sure.

DOCTOR X31
Uh, @@@, got it.  Can I get you to take your shoes and socks off?

PATIENT X31
Oh sure.  This helps.  I'm not as limber as I used to be.

DOCTOR X31
You're the most nimble 90-year-old person I've seen. 

PATIENT X31
Huh.

DOCTOR X31
You're the most nimble 90-year-old guy I've seen.

PATIENT X31
(Laughs).  Oh I come in every couple of months and they clip my toenails for me cause I can't reach them down there.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.  No falls at home?

PATIENT X31
Pardon?

DOCTOR X31
You've not been falling or anything?

PATIENT X31
No, no.

DOCTOR X31

PATIENT X31
Oh yeah, yeah.  I got, what is it Caldesene I put in my shoes for.

DOCTOR X31

PATIENT X31
Yes, yes, yes.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  Do you wash your feet every day?

PATIENT X31
As much as I can yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Do you wear tennis shoes?

PATIENT X31
Pardon?

DOCTOR X31
You wear shoes all the time?

PATIENT X31
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  @@@ this looks pretty good.  Where do you have the numbness?  Do you feel @@@?

PATIENT X31
Yeah, yeah.  I can feel it in there.  It's.

DOCTOR X31
Both these two sides are the same?

PATIENT X31
Yeah both sides.

DOCTOR X31
This and this is equal?

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  How far up does it go?

PATIENT X31
Oh about, about where you've got your thumb.

DOCTOR X31
Right here.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X31
I was, I went down to uh Texas in August.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.

PATIENT X31
My granddaughter graduated from basic training for the Air National Guard.

DOCTOR X31
Oh wow.

PATIENT X31
And uh I had to fly down to xxx and then we drove down to xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X31
Holy cow, that's a long drive.

PATIENT X31
Oh year it is, 12 hours.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah, Texas is a big state you know.

PATIENT X31
And uh.

DOCTOR X31
Was it the summer or what?

PATIENT X31
You noticed.

DOCTOR X31
Isn't it hot down there in August?

PATIENT X31
Not bad.

DOCTOR X31
xxx xxx?

PATIENT X31
It wasn't bad.  Well I'm used to it.  I was down there for two years during the war.

DOCTOR X31
Oh yeah?

PATIENT X31
I was in xxx, between.

DOCTOR X31
xxx is hot yeah.

PATIENT X31
I was between xxx and xxx at xxx xxx for two years.

DOCTOR X31
Did you like it down there?

PATIENT X31
Well it was nice.  I had my wife with me for a year.

DOCTOR X31
Deep breath in and out.  Breathe normal.

PATIENT X31
You want the shirt off?

DOCTOR X31
That's fine.  Almost done.  Alright.

PATIENT X31
Well that sounds alright.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.  Let's take a look at your throat, can you say ah?

PATIENT X31
Ah.

DOCTOR X31
Mmm, not too bad okay.  Did you take your blood pressure medicine today?

PATIENT X31
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Okay, your blood pressure is high.

PATIENT X31
No, oh yeah it is every time I come in.  I got the white coat syndrome.

DOCTOR X31
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X31
My had it too.

DOCTOR X31
Do you check it at home?

PATIENT X31
Yes.

DOCTOR X31
What is it at home?

PATIENT X31
Today I think it was 132/51 if I'm not mistaken.

DOCTOR X31
Do you check it every day?

PATIENT X31
Every day, every morning at 7 o'clock.

DOCTOR X31
Wow.  Okay.  Do you mind if I check it?

PATIENT X31
No, no, be my guest.  Do you the sleeve off?

DOCTOR X31
No just higher, @@@.  

PATIENT X31
Whatever you need, you just tell me that's all.  We'll get along fine.

DOCTOR X31
(Laughs).  Just relax your arm.

PATIENT X31
I should of brought my book along, cause I check my blood sugar every morning too.  I think this morning it was 132.  The only thing on that machine that they gave me to test your blood pressure, the pulse always shows up low.

DOCTOR X31
Does it?

PATIENT X31
Today it was 41.

DOCTOR X31
Your pulse is lower.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
I know that.

PATIENT X31
It's usually lower than average.

DOCTOR X31
Average yeah.

PATIENT X31
Uh.

DOCTOR X31
Well if you want to check it, you just get a stop watch or look at a clock and you can compare the two you know.

PATIENT X31
Well I did, they did that here for me uh.  One of the previous doctors I had was wondering whether I needed a pacemaker or not so they had, uh EKGs, a couple of those and uh then they said well we're gonna send you to the doctor, well they sent me to the head man.  I was fortunate to get the best and uh he looked at the EKGs and he checked me over like you're doing and he said what the hell did they send you in here for?

DOCTOR X31
(Laughs)

PATIENT X31
He says go home and enjoy your life.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.  But.

PATIENT X31
They took the pulse and it was low.  He took it and it was at normal.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.  So it could have been uh yeah.  User error right?

PATIENT X31
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Okay, so let's go with your feet.  I think this is probably diabetic.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Um, you know it's not unexpected having diabetes as long as you have.

PATIENT X31
Well, I see this @@@ advertising medicine on TV, PAD.

DOCTOR X31
That's different.

PATIENT X31
Is it?

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.

PATIENT X31
Oh, oh okay.

DOCTOR X31
I don't think you have that.

PATIENT X31
No I.

DOCTOR X31
That's different.

PATIENT X31
I was just wondering, I didn't know.

DOCTOR X31
That's poor blood flow down to your legs and I don't think you got that.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
You may have some; you know maybe not the best blood flow.

PATIENT X31
Right.

DOCTOR X31
Just given that we know you have heart problems.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
You've been walking the earth for 90 years.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
You've expect that from that but it's not the episode you're describing.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
You're describing sounds like the very beginnings of diabetic neuropathy.

PATIENT X31
Oh.

DOCTOR X31
Which is a complication of diabetes.

PATIENT X31
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  Other complications that we see is kidneys and the eyes.

PATIENT X31
Uh question, I have a stationary bicycle in the basement.

DOCTOR X31
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X31
I get down there whenever I think of it, I get down there and I get on for about 15 minutes, does that help?

DOCTOR X31
Shouldn't have much affect.

PATIENT X31
Won't have much?

DOCTOR X31
It's not the blood circulation.  

PATIENT X31
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X31
I mean it's good for your diabetes in general to be active.

PATIENT X31
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X31
But this is after time just the sugar uh damages the nerves.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
After a period of time.

PATIENT X31
Okay.

DOCTOR X31
So uh, it's a chronic condition.  It's not reversible really.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Um you just kind of try to treat it symptomatically if you can so, there's a couple ways we can go with it.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
We try medication, there's a couple medications for this, I don't think it works very well.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
And now you know whenever you add another medication there's the risks of side effects and those type of things or two we just go on without medication.  Um, the best way to treat it is just to keep good control of your blood sugar and do those types of things.

PATIENT X31
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X31
Blood sugar, blood pressure.

PATIENT X31
I hear that.  I have trouble there because I gotta a nice neighbor, an Italian widow and she and my wife were like this.  Now that my wife's gone, she feels that she has to take care of me.

DOCTOR X31
(Laughs).

PATIENT X31
So I get bowls of pasta and Italian, what do they call those sticks that they make Italian.

DOCTOR X31
The sausages or what?

PATIENT X31
No, no, no, like cookies.

DOCTOR X31
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

PATIENT X31
You know what I mean.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah those are like those round ones, yeah.

PATIENT X31
I got a, biscotti yeah.  I got a whole dish of (laughs).

DOCTOR X31
You can't eat this stuff okay?

PATIENT X31
I do, I take one.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.

PATIENT X31
One is as much as I take.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  Uh, the throat.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
It doesn't look very terrible to me.  I don't feel anything.  I don't think it's infected or anything like that.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
What it could be is one of two things, allergies or it could just the season you get dry air and that type of thing.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
For some reason it comes and goes.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
So um, we could one of two things, we could try to treat the allergies and see how that works um and we could give you, the way you do that is you take a pill for allergies, there's a nasal spray for allergies.  There are also nasal sprays of sterile water that just helps keep everything moist back there.

PATIENT X31
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X31
And that might help.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
More.  That's what I would suggest to you.  @@@.

PATIENT X31
Yeah, I had uh what difference that I hear in this; oh I remember I was in the drug store.  I went in to get something for a stuffy head.

DOCTOR X31
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X31
And uh I talked to the pharmacist and he didn't notice but there was an elderly gentleman standing to his right and uh after the pharmacist walked away the doctor told him, he says look I'm a doctor, take and use a salt solution, put it in your tent and inhale it.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.

PATIENT X31
He said that's as simple as you can get.

DOCTOR X31
It said living diabetes, right.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
That's why you're doing the salt water.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
That's exactly right, you just keep them moist.

PATIENT X31
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X31
We could try something like that.  That you can even buy over-the-counter or I could try to get you some here from the VA but then there's a nasal spray, it's a steroid spray, it helps reduce inflammation.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
And uh there's a pill that you take for allergies.  I think this may be allergic or it just may be seasonal but I think we could try to do both of them and see if that kind of makes things better and then we could kind of stop doing them for a time.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.  No that's alright.  I don't have to sing that much in church because most of the time I'm out in the vestibule cause I'm an usher now.

DOCTOR X31
You don't want to try these things?

PATIENT X31
Oh I'll try something sure.

DOCTOR X31
Okay and then for the feet.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Did you want to try the medication or not?  You know I would propose that we don't, just because they don't work real good.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Uh and it's a pill that you take three times a day and you have to start out at low doses and you build up and even then it doesn't work very well.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Unfortunately these are the only things that we don't normally like to treat.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
It's a complication from diabetes.

PATIENT X31
Okay.

DOCTOR X31
I mean if you want the medicine, it's basically just to help relieve the symptoms.  You're not having any pain in your feet, just.

PATIENT X31
Well let's go without it for just now.

DOCTOR X31
Okay, I kind of like that idea too.

PATIENT X31
Yeah alright.

DOCTOR X31
Okay.  Um let me get you set up.  We'll get your labs; I'll refill your medications um.  Why don't you go ahead and get dressed and I'll be back in a couple of minutes okay?

PATIENT X31
Okie doke.


DOCTOR X31
Needs some help, got it?

PATIENT X31
I was just wondering with my instability whether I should be walking with a cane or not.

DOCTOR X31
Uh do you think you need one?

PATIENT X31
I'd rather not if I don't need it.

DOCTOR X31
I'm not gonna tell you, but it's got to be your decision.  I mean you know if you need help.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
And uh.

PATIENT X31
No I uh.

DOCTOR X31
I can't tell you just by looking at you.

PATIENT X31
No I can walk pretty good.

DOCTOR X31
Okay, I'm not gonna make you get a cane if you.

PATIENT X31
Uh I was questioned about that trip to Washington @@@.

DOCTOR X31
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X31
Those things?

DOCTOR X31
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X31
The VFW.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah.

PATIENT X31
And on the questionnaire if you can walk the length of a football field that'll be one thing but if you need a cane or if you need a wheelchair we will provide it so uh I'm kind of banking on that.

DOCTOR X31
(Laughs)

PATIENT X31
I hope to go there spring.

DOCTOR X31
Well that'd be great.  Alright, give me a minute to get this stuff set-up alright.

PATIENT X31
Yeah, fine.

DOCTOR OUT:  60:37  DOCTOR IN:  67:31

DOCTOR X31
Alrighty.  So let's uh.  His blood pressure yeah so.  There's another one that was high too before, uh if you take it at home that's fine.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
So let's do this, I'll give you a nasal saline spray.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
You get any drops that relieve, it's cheaper than if I gave it to you.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
Or what I can give you is um the pills for allergies if you want.  I think we should try both and just and if that works then we know that we're kind of hitting the right thing.

PATIENT X31
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X31
How's that sound?

PATIENT X31
Yeah that sounds about right.

DOCTOR X31
So you should probably go pick it up today in the Pharmacy uh, and hopefully it will help you out.  They have them over-the-counter too um but we can get it from here pretty cheap I think.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
It's just like Claritin or any of those that you can buy.  I'm sure you've seen those and then uh I will see you again, uh what do you think, three months okay?

PATIENT X31
You tell me.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah, let's try three months and we could take some labs you at that time.

PATIENT X31
Alright.

DOCTOR X31
And you should be fasting because we want to check the cholesterol and that type of thing okay.

PATIENT X31
I think, I think my wife was using a spray called Afrin.

DOCTOR X31
Afrin you're not gonna use.

PATIENT X31
No.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah, let's avoid that.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
That's for uh runny nose mostly and stuffy nose sometimes.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
And uh, I don't like it.  It can increase your blood pressure, it can speed your heart up uh.  You kind of become addicted to it so if you don't use it you could have a stuffy nose all the time.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
It's just a kind of medicine, except for a very specific situation.

PATIENT X31
Good to know, that's enough.

DOCTOR X31
Alright.

PATIENT X31
I'll take your word for it.

DOCTOR X31
Uh okay.  

PATIENT X31
Now I should stop downstairs at the Pharmacy.

DOCTOR X31
You got a couple stops.  First is at the nurses right here.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
You know where that is?

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
And on your way out, you go to the front desk.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
They'll make an appointment in three months.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
And then you stop at the Pharmacy and they should be getting your medicine ready right now.

PATIENT X31
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR X31
So I think by the time you get down there it'll be ready.

PATIENT X31
Fine, thank you.

DOCTOR X31
In theory no I mean, it may not be, you know.

PATIENT X31
No they're pretty good down there.

DOCTOR X31
Okay so then.

PATIENT X31
When they say waiting time is a half hour, it usually is about a half hour.

DOCTOR X31
Um so next time we see you, we'll schedule those labs.

PATIENT X31
Alright.

DOCTOR X31
Um we'll just do blood draws to make sure your fasting lipids, check your urine too.

PATIENT X31
Yeah.

DOCTOR X31
And after that and I hope you have a Merry Christmas.

PATIENT X31
Thank you, same to you.  Good luck.

DOCTOR X31
Yes thanks.  Stay warm out there huh.

PATIENT X31
Pardon?

DOCTOR X31
Try to stay warm out there.

PATIENT X31
Oh I'm always warm.

DOCTOR X31
@@@.

PATIENT X31
I bet I've got more clothes than you could possibly wear in your lifetime.  My wife believed in having everything in the closet.

DOCTOR X31
Yeah just in case right.

PATIENT X31
Oh hell.  Up in the attic, when I was cleaning that out, I'm still working on it incidentally.  I see some of her wigs up there yet and stuff like that and uh at one side of the attic; to the stop of the steps she had eight garment bags.  I started at this end and worked through one at a time, her clothes, my clothes.  I came to the last one.  I opened the zipper and I almost fell over.  Ten of my older suits were in there.  When I worked in the office down at Brinks, so I needed clothes but then I went downstairs in the closets, I got 11 outfits down there (laughs).

DOCTOR X31
@@@ yeah.  It's to have back-ups to your back-ups.

PATIENT X31
No so every morning I was at home, or every Sunday morning I wear a suit to church, different one all the time you know.  People say what did you do get another suit (laughs).

DOCTOR X31
Now you @@@.

PATIENT X31
Oh yeah.  

DOCTOR X31
Alright sir, so the first stop will be the Nurses Station and uh, go right down here to this door and it's on your left side then okay.

PATIENT X31

DOCTOR X548
Alright, how are you doing today?

PATIENT X548
I'm fine.  @@@ I'm living.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.  That's good.  I understand that you have kind of some chronic pain.

PATIENT X548
Yeah.

DOCTOR X548
Okay after a car accident?

PATIENT X548
You know I've been this way most of my life cause of the car accident and I started having these dreams and be suffering in my sleep and they're starting to get worse.

DOCTOR X548
And that was all after the car accident?

PATIENT X548
Yeah.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.

PATIENT X548
Well actually it was there before the car accident, started to get better and then they got worse.  So it's coming back again.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.

PATIENT X548
And I've had these probably since at least '81.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.  What kind of dreams do you have?

PATIENT X548
Fighting, I'm always fighting.

DOCTOR X548
Who are you fighting?

PATIENT X548
I don't know, I'm getting jumped by people @@@ you know.  Sometimes I remember them, sometimes I don't and it seems like @@@.  

DOCTOR X548
@@@.

PATIENT X548
I have an appointment with her so.

DOCTOR X548
@@@ that's okay.  Have you um @@@.

PATIENT X548
@@@.

DOCTOR X548
Okay, @@@.

PATIENT X548
Yes.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.  Any thoughts of suicide or anything?

PATIENT X548
No.  @@@ but.

DOCTOR X548
Um.

PATIENT X548
It's just sometimes you know just things I can't do anymore I just you know, @@@.  Time for me to give up.

DOCTOR X548
When did you start having these thoughts?

PATIENT X548
A while back.

DOCTOR X548
In the last couple of weeks or?

PATIENT X548
Maybe about a month ago.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.  What um, do you have a plan?

PATIENT X548
No, I don't have no plan.  I get to be in certain situations in certain areas then I think this would be a good way to go.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.  Do you plan on following through with that?

PATIENT X548
No.  After I think about it for a while, then I don't do it and time passes and I just forget about it.  Like a couple weeks ago I was stopped by a train, so I am just sitting there, I was the first car there you know I like to think about it, just going up there and falling in between the trains and it was like I mean it was the intention it was like you know I could do this you know but I don't know, the train passed, it was a long train so I sat there a while thinking about it and the train passed and I went on my way and then later on I didn't think about it no more.  Maybe it's just like they come in spurts you know.  It's just like there's times when I'll be sitting and I'm thinking and.

DOCTOR X548
Do you uh when they come in spurts, do you hear any voices or anything like that?

PATIENT X548
@@@ I don't know, it's like I'm not really there. I don't know how to explain.

DOCTOR X548
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like.  No, no I hear you.  Is it kind of like an out of body thing?  Like it's more kind of primal, does that make sense?

PATIENT X548
Hmm.

DOCTOR X548
Or is that not the way to describe it?

PATIENT X548
I don't know.

DOCTOR X548
Different.

PATIENT X548
I don't know a cycle.  I'm dreaming that I'm awake and dreaming this and you know somehow this stuff happens.  I can see myself, let's just say I can see myself walking doing these things.

DOCTOR X548
What are some of the @@@?

PATIENT X548
I don't want to talk about @@@.  That's how you @@@.

DOCTOR X548
Well, let me tell you what, like I know, I know we don't know each other very well but um like I'm afraid that you might, you might walk out of here today and act on some of these.

PATIENT X548
Yeah, I haven't done anything yet.

DOCTOR X548
I know but I think that's the key thing.  I think these are some of the things I hear you're kind of reaching out to me and I want to.

PATIENT X548
No you're just making me think about them.

DOCTOR X548
No, no, no, no, but I'm not a bad guy alright by all means.  You know I don't but I think that these are some warning things that maybe we should um; you know maybe this could be a little bit more emergent than maybe both you and I kind of think you know.  Like I don't want tomorrow something to happen to you after I just talked to you today you know like this is my opportunity of being your doctor and you know and knowing you today to maybe step in and you know, maybe save your life you know.

PATIENT X548
Well I got an appointment with my doctor.

DOCTOR X548
I know but what if you don't make it that far?

PATIENT X548
Oh I'll make it.  I'll make it, I'm still, I'll go.

DOCTOR X548
I know but I'm a little worried so.  Have you um as far as some of the dreams have you been jumped before is this all from the war?

PATIENT X548
I was never in the war.  @@@ in the service.

DOCTOR X548
Okay.  Otherwise you've been jumped before?

PATIENT X548
No.

DOCTOR X548
By um, @@@ I understand it's kind of a traumatic experience.

PATIENT X548
Yeah well, have you ever been, going into a room with somebody that you supposedly know and then get your head beat up with a Billy club.

DOCTOR X548
Yeah that's kind of how it happened for me yeah.

PATIENT X548

DOCTOR X548

PATIENT X677
Okay.

DOCTOR X677
Make sure you don’t have any sort of @@@ or anything back there, you know, that could be possible cancer.  I am not saying you have cancer.  Most likely you have just some enlargement of the prostate which is stuff that guys get as they get older.

DOCTOR X677
@@@.  You know what, it is going to be a little tricky because I want to give you a little bit of a water pill.  So that will get off that extra fluid, it’s going to help your legs but I want to make sure you are peeing okay and it is going to be more comfortable.  You know, so maybe we will wait and see if the peeing symptoms clear for a little bit and then once you go to the bathroom regularly with an average stream, @@@ start the water pill.

PATIENT X677
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X677
Okay.  It will help you, actually you might be able to back off that @@@ substitute the amlodipine @@@.

PATIENT X677
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X677
@@@.  I will talk to my boss and we will come up with a medication regimen that will be better for your legs.  

PATIENT X677

DOCTOR OUT:  49:35  DOCTOR IN:  64:40

DOCTOR X677
@@@.  We are going to make a few changes to your meds today.  

PATIENT X677
Okay.

DOCTOR X677
@@@ makes it worse.  So you want to cut that out.  No more @@@.  We are going to start you on a water pill and a pill for your prostate.  

PATIENT X677
Okay.

DOCTOR X677
Okay so we are, @@@ taking away one and we are adding two but I think we are going to really help the swelling in your legs.  

PATIENT X677
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X677
Really going to help it.  @@@.  And then we are also going to get you stockings @@@.

PATIENT X677
What kind of stockings are these?

DOCTOR X677
They are called compression stockings.  Basically they are really tight fitting socks and the come up to right about here.  And they are tight fitting and they squeeze all of the fluid back into the veins.  @@@ happening in your veins, veins @@@ take up blood from down here and they bring it back to the heart.  And veins @@@ so the blood moves up a little bit, the valve closes it and it doesn’t come back down.  Your problem @@@ like that, the blood constantly comes back down. 

PATIENT X677
Alright.

DOCTOR X677
The pressure of the arteries taking the blood to the feet, and the veins trying to back up, that pressure is goes up down here and the extra fluid is pushed down into the leg.

PATIENT X677
Oh.

DOCTOR X677
Yea.  You keep putting pressure on this leg, @@@, your heart is putting pressure on this leg but the veins aren’t doing their job because they are @@@ to you, so the pressure goes up @@@.

PATIENT X677
Okay.

DOCTOR X677
Okay?  The trick is, let’s try to squeeze that fluid back into the veins, back into the veins and the veins @@@ is an artificial valve in your legs, with the compression stockings.  Sound good?

PATIENT X677
Yes, sir.

DOCTOR X677
Alright.  Alright, so let me um, we are doing to discontinue the amlodipine today.  Okay.  And let me get you that water pill too.  Alright and you can go to uh, actually go @@@.

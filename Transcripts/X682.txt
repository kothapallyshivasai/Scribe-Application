PATIENT X682
And you said it wasn't up last time and.

DOCTOR X682
Yeah.

PATIENT X682
So where do you get that 280?

DOCTOR X682
I think it was incorrectly put in here.

PATIENT X682
Oh.  So that's what the VA is supposed to read.

DOCTOR X682

PATIENT X682
Yeah.  Well it could be closer to the next appointment.

DOCTOR X682
It really doesn't matter.

PATIENT X682
@@@.

DOCTOR X682
Do it, yeah.  As long as you're taking your medicine I don't mind.

PATIENT X682
Right.  As long as it's before the next appointment.

DOCTOR X682
Correct, yeah.

PATIENT X682
Do you think it'd be best to have it as close to the next appointment as possible?

DOCTOR X682
I will @@@ whenever you get it done.

PATIENT X682
Right.

DOCTOR X682
If you get it done sooner, I'll take a look at it.  You want to be in the record before the next visit, I'll look at it then.

PATIENT X682
Yes.

DOCTOR X682
You see what I'm saying?

PATIENT X682
Yes.

DOCTOR X682
So either way I'll pick them up.

PATIENT X682
And so it doesn't make any difference really.

DOCTOR X682
Right.

PATIENT X682
As long as it's before the next appointment.

DOCTOR X682
Correct.

PATIENT X682
Yeah.

DOCTOR X682

DOCTOR X682
Alright sir.  @@@.

DOCTOR X682
You know your weight has been stable.

PATIENT X682
Yes.

DOCTOR X682
You're still overweight.

PATIENT X682
Yeah.

DOCTOR X682
So I want you to go to this program we have called TeleMove.

PATIENT X682
@@@.

DOCTOR X682
Do you have a phone at home?

PATIENT X682
Yeah.

DOCTOR X682
So what you can do is you can call this number here.

PATIENT X682
Yeah.

DOCTOR X682
And this is a program that we offer through the VA and it helps individuals to lose weight and to stay on track.

PATIENT X682
@@@.

DOCTOR X682
Helping people with diet and exercise.

PATIENT X682
Yeah.

DOCTOR X682
And it's something that kind of, you know keep talking to you about this and keeping an eye on it.  Are you interested in this?  @@@.

PATIENT X682
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR X682
Okay.

PATIENT X682
Okay.  So I'm overweight.

DOCTOR X682
Yeah.

PATIENT X682
I'm losing weight but I'm not getting there.

DOCTOR X682
Correct and I think that it'll help your cholesterol and help with the other.  We'll try to see that you get a couple pounds off.

PATIENT X682
Right.

DOCTOR X682
And the wintertime is really a hard time for people to lose weight just because you're indoors a lot, all of the holidays, things like that.

PATIENT X682
Right, good.  Maybe I shouldn't eat as much hmm.

DOCTOR X682
Well I think it's not what you eat, it's just to watch the portion size.

PATIENT X682
Right.

DOCTOR X682
So.

PATIENT X682
And I don't want to be on those exercise machines.

DOCTOR X682
Well are you definitely, this is a really good resource cause they give you a lot of different options.

PATIENT X682
Hmm.

DOCTOR X682
And so they'll go through with you all of the things that you can do.

PATIENT X682
Right.

DOCTOR X682
So if you say oh no I don't want to exercise, she'll talk with you and help you out with that.

PATIENT X682
Right.

DOCTOR X682
Okay.

PATIENT X682
Okay.

DOCTOR X682
I will see you back in a couple of months.  We get a cholesterol drawn before you come in okay.

PATIENT X682
Right.

DOCTOR X682
So no rush on that.

PATIENT X682
Right.  So you already ordered it so.

DOCTOR X682
I'm putting it in right now.

PATIENT X682
Right.

DOCTOR X682
Alright sir, take care.

PATIENT X682

DOCTOR X682

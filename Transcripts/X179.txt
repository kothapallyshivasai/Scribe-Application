DOCTOR X179
PATIENT?  How you doing sir?  Pleased to meet you.  You normally see DOCTOR?

PATIENT X179
I haven't seen my regular doctor for probably about six or seven months.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  What brings you in today?

PATIENT X179
Uh actually I was in the Emergency Room a couple weeks ago with um pain in my arms and my chest and uh now I notice that I'm having uh bouts of headaches along with continued limb pain and some chest pain and uh a lot of coughing.

DOCTOR X179
Okay what's the number one complaint, the arm pain?

PATIENT X179
Yeah the arm pain.

DOCTOR X179
And uh why haven't you seen the regular doctor?

PATIENT X179
I haven't been.

DOCTOR X179
They didn't schedule you or anything.

PATIENT X179
Something like that.

DOCTOR X179
Um.  Now you tell me you were in the ER and they wanted you to be admitted.

PATIENT X179
Yeah and I uh.  When I went there the problem had been going on for about three days but after I was in the Emergency I wasn't experiencing that same problem so I didn't feel like I could stay in the hospital for something that I didn't feel like it was a problem at the time.

DOCTOR X179
So who was your main doctor before?

PATIENT X179
I couldn't even tell you sir.  It just seems like every year I get a new doctor.  I get seen by them once or twice and then I get another new one.

DOCTOR X179
Have you been taking your medications?

PATIENT X179
The ones that I can get.  I have run out of clopidogrel.  I have no more prescriptions available for metoprolol and I'm down to my last, I have no more refills for my glipizide and only one refill remaining for my metformin and just keeping up with what I'm taking it's just impossible trying to do this online and order.  No names, just numbers.  

DOCTOR X179
Are you getting any chest pain right now?

PATIENT X179
Not at this moment no.

DOCTOR X179
Um so you have left arm pain.  How long has the left arm pain been going on?

PATIENT X179
Oh totally for about a month, maybe six weeks.

DOCTOR X179
Uh is it worse when you use it?

PATIENT X179
It's just, it feels like it's under the skin, maybe in the veins and it has nothing to do with using the arm or not.

DOCTOR X179
Any rash?

PATIENT X179
None noticed.

DOCTOR X179
Have you injured your arm in any way?

PATIENT X179
No.

DOCTOR X179
Is it worse if you get up, if you're walking around, you're doing a flight of stairs or something?

PATIENT X179
It's not always in the arm.  Sometimes I just feel you know just short of breath, just gentle walking.  I'm in sales so I don't do a lot.

DOCTOR X179
Yeah.  How much activity, do you ever go up the stairs at all, like uh?

PATIENT X179
Not really.

DOCTOR X179
Okay um and you don't walk much?  Have you walked into?  How did you get here, did you walk from the parking lot?

PATIENT X179
From the parking lot yeah.

DOCTOR X179
So walking from the parking lot here, did you get short of breath?

PATIENT X179
I didn't park that far away, I was pretty close.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  Do you do housework at all?

PATIENT X179
On occasion.

DOCTOR X179
Do you get short of breath with that?

PATIENT X179
I haven't done any housework lately.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.

PATIENT X179
I haven't done anything to exert myself, only just walking on the lot to find a car.

DOCTOR X179
Okay when you've had chest pain, can you describe it for me?

PATIENT X179
I want to say you know like a quick stabbing or pressure uh.  Like someone pushing on my chest.

DOCTOR X179
Okay how long does it last?

PATIENT X179
Seconds.

DOCTOR X179
Where is it worse, where is it?

PATIENT X179
It's usually in the left side.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  When was the last time you took Plavix?

PATIENT X179
What's Plavix?

DOCTOR X179
I mean clopidogrel?

PATIENT X179
Uh two days ago, I ran out.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  Now are you using the insulin?

PATIENT X179
Yes.  I'm up to 18 units per day.

DOCTOR X179
Simvastatin?

PATIENT X179
Simvastatin I don't know about that.

DOCTOR X179
It's a cholesterol medication.

PATIENT X179
I'm not sure if it's required, I'm not missing any of my meds.  Maybe my night medication, just because I'm so tired when I come from work, I just get home and pass out rather than taking more medicine.

DOCTOR X179
Are you still smoking or no?

PATIENT X179
No I haven't smoked in almost two years, that's why I'm complaining about the cough.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  How long have you been coughing?

PATIENT X179
Uh only about three months.  That's actually one thing my thinks that we should find out what that is and it doesn't matter whether I'm at work or whether I'm at home, I get really severe coughing from time to time.

DOCTOR X179
Did you eat anything this morning?

PATIENT X179
Not yet, usually about 10 o'clock is when I have breakfast.

DOCTOR X179
Do you want to pick up these medications today or have them sent to you?

PATIENT X179
Uh the ones I run out, I especially need to pick up.

DOCTOR X179
Are you still taking the iron?

PATIENT X179
Yes I have taken it. I take it.

DOCTOR X179
How about the doxazosin?

PATIENT X179
Yeah.

DOCTOR X179
Are you having much urinary trouble?

PATIENT X179
I'm still going frequently at night.

DOCTOR X179
And what were the ones that you need today?  I'm sorry, the Plavix or the clopidogrel.

PATIENT X179
And glipizide.  I probably got about two weeks left and metoprolol uh; I don't have any more prescriptions available for that.  I've probably got about a week's worth left.  

DOCTOR X179
What have your sugars been running?

PATIENT X179
Last time I did take the time to check they were in the high 100s, like almost 200.

DOCTOR X179
Have you been getting low at all?

PATIENT X179
Yeah a few times it's gotten low.

DOCTOR X179
How long have you been taking the insulin?

PATIENT X179
Three months maybe.

DOCTOR X179
You started it when?

PATIENT X179
Last um, @@@.  She asked to have me see a diabetes educator a couple times.  So they've been reading notes in there from her.

DOCTOR X179
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X179
No.

DOCTOR X179
Have you tried hydrochlorothiazide in the past?

PATIENT X179
I can't remember what it is.

DOCTOR X179
It's a medication for blood pressure.

PATIENT X179
I've only taken lisinopril for blood pressure.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  Have you been checking your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X179
No.

DOCTOR X179
No.  Alright.  I'm going to increase the lisinopril to 40 and start you on a medication; well I'll probably start you on another one, the hydrochlorothiazide.  Okay and I also want you to see the cardiologist again um.  I don't think that chest pain sounds terrible cardiogenic but um shortness of breath is a little more concerning.  You know you had a positive stress test in the past and you know sometimes we can do an angiogram.  Um have you ever had an angiogram before?  They go in through the groin to take a look at the heart vessels.

PATIENT X179
I'm not sure.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  You want to sit up there.  Well you know, I think we want to make sure you know you're not having any major um, increased blockage in the heart.

PATIENT X179
Right.

DOCTOR X179
Now I think last time they thought that was unlikely based on the stress test um but you may, they may need to do an angiogram.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
Okay because of your diabetes and if there was a major blockage and you needed to undergo you know good severe disease then thye may need to maybe either put a stent in or.

PATIENT X179
Yeah.

DOCTOR X179
Do a bypass.  I don't think right now you're not getting anything acute.  I don't think you're having a heart attack or anything like that but there could be a little bit of angina.  Um so I think you should be seen by them again.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
You've only seen them once is that correct?

PATIENT X179
Yes just once.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  Take some deep breaths.  Any sores on your legs, concerns about your feet or anything like that?

PATIENT X179
Not on the feet.  I banged my leg a few days ago and this seems to be taking a longer time than normal to heal.

DOCTOR X179
Okay if it doesn't look worse than that, you know if it doesn't heal in a week or so then you know okay.  @@@ up alright.  Um any stomach pain when I press?

PATIENT X179
No.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  Alright uh I think we'll put you in the morning.  We can't determine until we get, we can't do labs up here so you just sit in here and I'll @@@ okay and I called DOCTOR but I think DOCTOR was your primary.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
@@@.  Alright you can sit in the chair.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  44:12  DOCTOR IN:  59:06)

DOCTOR X179
Alright uh so you know you've been talking for three months.  I need to ask you a little bit more about that.  I've got to write down the other stuff.  Is it a dry cough or?

PATIENT X179
Yeah mostly it's dry and eventually I get some phlegm up.

DOCTOR X179
You do okay.  So I want to do a chest x-ray today um and then um you know the medication you're on, the lisinopril.

PATIENT X179
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X179
That can cause a cough.  I mean and uh it can happen any time.

PATIENT X179
Okay cause I haven't been smoking for almost two years now.

DOCTOR X179
Yeah.

PATIENT X179
And almost immediately after I stopped smoking I stopped having the cough until recently at sometimes.

DOCTOR X179
Do have any runny nose or?

PATIENT X179
Yeah.

DOCTOR X179
It could also be postnasal drip from allergies okay.  Where everything comes down.  You say your nose has been stuffy and draining?  Okay well we can try that too um there's medications for it okay.  So I'm going to give you this nasal, there's a nasal inhaler.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
Um it's called Flonase.

PATIENT X179
Yes I've taken that before.

DOCTOR X179
When have you taken it?

PATIENT X179
Uh years ago.

DOCTOR X179
Well I think it could help.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
And then we'll get a chest x-ray today.  Uh you can get labs done @@@ okay.  And then let me see your arms, the left arm.  Have you been taking anything for this?  

PATIENT X179
No I try to avoid taking over-the-counter meds.

DOCTOR X179
I think you can try some Tylenol.  Where does the pain go.

PATIENT X179
Usually it's just going through the muscle and it feels like it's just under the skin.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  Does it hurt when I press on that?

PATIENT X179
Not really.

DOCTOR X179
Okay.  Uh well you know usually these things are musculoskeletal and benign.

PATIENT X179
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X179
Uh I think you should try some Tylenol first and maybe do some ice to it and uh see what that; you could just do just over-the-counter Tylenol; it's cheaper if you buy it.

PATIENT X179
I'm a internal bleeder.

DOCTOR X179
Yeah Tylenol is safe.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
From that standpoint so you know don't take it more than like four times a day though.

PATIENT X179
Yeah.

DOCTOR X179
Um and then they did a chest x-ray in the ER when you were there.

PATIENT X179
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X179
But uh they only did the one view with the portable machine.

PATIENT X179
Right.

DOCTOR X179
I mean those aren't the best x-rays, especially for us so we'll get a real one and have you go down and get it after you, whichever line is shorter, you can get them both done today.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
Um.

PATIENT X179
So you want some lab work and x-rays right?

DOCTOR X179
Yes and then I'll take care of the meds.  We're going to switch you on a different, I'm going to take you off that lisinopril and put you on something else.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
A similar medication that's going to help the cough in case that's what's doing it.  Okay.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
Alright um and I want you to come back like in three months.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
And you can see me and I put a note in for the cardiologist to see you.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
Um so that should be scheduled, if not, if they don't get hold of you in a week or so give them a call.  Cause definitely I want you to see them.

PATIENT X179
Okay.

DOCTOR X179
Cause you know you may need an angiogram.

PATIENT X179
Alright.

DOCTOR X179
Um okay.

PATIENT X179
Okay doc.

DOCTOR X179
Alright take care.

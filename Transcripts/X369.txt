DOCTOR X369
Patient?
 
PATIENT X369
Right here.

DOCTOR X369
Okay, @@@.  Okay right down here.  How are doing?

PATIENT X369
I'm well how are you?

DOCTOR X369
Good.  Okay. 

PATIENT X369
I was wondering if I was going to get the blood drawn last night or this morning because of traffic this morning.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
I come all the way from xxx xxx so.

DOCTOR X369
Okay, let me put it in for you.  Is that okay?

PATIENT X369
That's fine.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.  What was going on today?

PATIENT X369
Uh I need, I haven't been here in quite a while.  In fact I haven't been here since DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X369
Okay and he left over a year ago okay.

PATIENT X369
But uh and when I had put in for my medication uh some of them were denied so and apparently they changed the rules or something where I have to go.  I have uh mild PTSD.

DOCTOR X369
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X369
And anxiety so they had me on Paxil.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
On low dose Paxil and lorazepam in case I have any.

DOCTOR X369
Do you see Mental Health at all or not?

PATIENT X369
No I've never.

DOCTOR X369
Or the doctor just renewed it.

PATIENT X369
DOCTOR just renewed it. 

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
He's the one that started it for me.

DOCTOR X369
Oh really okay.

PATIENT X369
So.  I'm gonna go with @@@.  So you're the fifth doctor I've had in the 14 years I've been here so.

DOCTOR X369
Really?  So you only have me for a year cause I took over this clinic last year when I was a second year resident so I'm with DOCTOR and if you check out well today I'm only going have you come back in a year so you might see somebody different.

PATIENT X369
Well I'm a teacher so they used to have me coming every three months to get blood tests but I just.

DOCTOR X369
That's alright.

PATIENT X369
I was supposed to be on gemfibrozil and niacin as well but neither of those were renewed either so.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
I still have some so I still use the gemfibrozil and I had high triglycerides is one other thing and low cholesterol.  

DOCTOR X369
Okay um any problems today that you'd like to address.  I kind of want to get your meds checked today.

PATIENT X369
Well I have something my wife told me to ask you about.  She's a nurse in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
But her father has had bouts with skin cancer and I got these bumps that kind of started, well I got a couple on each one of my hands.  But they're irregular shaped and.

DOCTOR X369
But they don't look like skin cancer to me.

PATIENT X369
Well she said I might need to have Dermatology check it.

DOCTOR X369
So if it's like one color, usually it's a skin color, it's like different colors.

PATIENT X369
So this is just it.

DOCTOR X369
And it's irregular.

PATIENT X369
The skin tags I keep getting.

DOCTOR X369
Maybe.  If you do have skin tags that you get.

PATIENT X369
I do get skin tags.

DOCTOR X369
And do they start out looking like that?

PATIENT X369
No.

DOCTOR X369
They don't.

PATIENT X369
They just come up like little skin tags and then they just get bigger and bigger.

DOCTOR X369
Okay so how long has it been that size?

PATIENT X369
Uh it just got, I just grew these this summer.

DOCTOR X369
So just this summer.  I feel like they might even just be freckles.  If they continue to get bigger then you call in to see any doctor and at that time you can be referred to Derm.  I don't think that looks like skin cancer.  It doesn't even look like basal cell and what do you do, are you always out in the sun all the time?

PATIENT X369
I spend a lot of time out in the sun.

DOCTOR X369
You do.

PATIENT X369
I have two daughters and since I'm a teacher, I spend the entire summer taking care of them.

DOCTOR X369
Okay, okay and then anyone else in your family, in your blood relatives have anything like this?

PATIENT X369
I don't really, I don't really keep contact with my family much so.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
I don't think so.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
We have more bone cancer.

DOCTOR X369
Do you burn when you go in the sun or do you?

PATIENT X369
Uh maybe once in a great while.

DOCTOR X369
Do you tan more than you burn?

PATIENT X369
Mostly I tan yeah.

DOCTOR X369
Okay so that's a good thing.  That means it's less likely that.  Cause usually people who burn have a higher susceptibility to cancer.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
People who tan naturally, outside of black people and Asian people don't get skin cancer.  It's very rare if we do.  That's because we tan, we don't burn okay.  I mean there's a mechanism for that but I don't think that looks like skin cancer.  That looks almost like a mole to me.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
Okay. But keep an eye on it though.  If you think it’s getting bigger and it looks different then for sure you need to go.

PATIENT X369
Right.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.  Um yeah so just definitely keep an eye on it.  I could send you now but I'm pretty sure.

PATIENT X369
I had so much other stuff happening right now with my knee messed up.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.  Why don't we, so why don't you keep an eye on that and have your wife keep an eye on that okay?

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
Um and in the next 20 minutes or so what else do you want to address for today?  Cause we can actually have a six month follow-up, I won't do the yearly follow-up.  We can do every three months for now.

PATIENT X369
Well the three months would be excessive.  I'm a teacher right now and then I'm missing a day of school for today.

DOCTOR X369
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X369
So for me to be here.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
In the and frankly it's harder for me to be gone from school than it is for me to be here.

DOCTOR X369
What do you teach?

PATIENT X369
I'm a chemistry teacher.

DOCTOR X369
Oh okay at a private school?

PATIENT X369
Yeah.

DOCTOR X369
Okay cool.  Um what else, what is it, tell me the three things that are bothering you the most and we'll try to address those today.

PATIENT X369
Well my neck always seems to bother me, that's why I'm here, so I'm in the VA System.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
Uh lower back has always bothered me.

DOCTOR X369
So no chronic issues then?

PATIENT X369
Yeah those are chronic.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
But I worry about, I've had a lot of anxiety attacks.  I think I've had more not having medicine and I think it might be because I don't have medicine.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.  That we'll take care like I said.

PATIENT X369
That's huge.

DOCTOR X369
So that's the big thing was medicine.

PATIENT X369
Yeah I'm worried about the meds.  That's a big chunk of that.

DOCTOR X369
We'll give you your meds today don't worry. 

PATIENT X369
And then my knee, which I'm already in the system with Ortho for.

DOCTOR X369
Okay so the plan for today our main thing is to make sure all your meds are in line.

PATIENT X369
Exactly.

DOCTOR X369
And make sure you have enough of everything.

PATIENT X369
And so you might actually get ahead of the schedule which is rare for me.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah so actually you've actually been really good on medicines, so really they've changed a lot around with how the clinics are running, especially the Gen Med clinics.  They made it a lot easier for us and hired a lot more nursing staff who are very good now and like, so it's almost like xxx.

PATIENT X369
Well we used to have some that they were mad that we were here and we're like wait a minute, we're the veterans which is why you have a job you know.

DOCTOR X369
Right, right, exactly, who the doctors or the nurses?

PATIENT X369
It's so fun.  The nurses, the nurses.

DOCTOR X369
No.  At least my team here is very good.  They're a lot better with everything now okay.

PATIENT X369
And this one, I've never had a problem General Medical.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.

PATIENT X369
It's the people that used to be what they called Pod 4.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
Back in the old days.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
Where they'd make you go all the way down four blocks.

DOCTOR X369
Oh really.

PATIENT X369
It seems to get you to the clinic.

DOCTOR X369
Alright.

PATIENT X369
They were nasty to the vets.

DOCTOR X369
Okay so right now it shows that you don't have any @@@.  The hydrocodone, tramadol. 

PATIENT X369
And the hydrocodone is for my knee.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
I actually need to renew that one somehow.

DOCTOR X369
Okay I can renew that.  You're on tramadol for pain.

PATIENT X369
Yeah that's supposed to be to supplement the meloxicam cause they told me I can't any more than one meloxicam and no other NSAIDs.

DOCTOR X369
Right.

PATIENT X369
And then when the pain gets worse I have to take tramadol.

DOCTOR X369
Right.

PATIENT X369
So I've, my first neck surgery failed and then the vertebra pinched on the, they didn't put the metal plate in the first surgery.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
So the vertebra pinched on the brachial path of the nerves.

DOCTOR X369
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X369
So I have permanent nerve damage and I constantly in a spasm in my left shoulder and down my arm.

DOCTOR X369
Hmm.

PATIENT X369
So the reason I have the long term, which it's been really, really long term meds which I know it's not supposed to be recommended.

DOCTOR X369
Right.

PATIENT X369
But we've gone through every NSAID that there is.

DOCTOR X369
Do you eat something @@@?

PATIENT X369
Oh yeah.  That's the only one that hasn't killed my stomach yet.

DOCTOR X369
Okay, alright.  So I'll renew these meds and then we'll go back through your old meds and see what you need to get okay.  Um @@@.

PATIENT X369
I will warn you, whenever you put in gemfibrozil, for some reason they always like over send me.

DOCTOR X369
Oh really.

PATIENT X369
They tell me that I'm supposed to be running out but I still have more.  I don't know how I take it, like @@@.

DOCTOR X369
We're going to change it to a 90 day supply alrighty.  

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
So you'll have a 90 day supply.  Do you want me to mail it or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT X369
I usually get them mailed.

DOCTOR X369
You want them mailed today.

PATIENT X369
I still have a little bit of everything except for the head medicine.

DOCTOR X369
Okay so the hydrocodone I don't think they'll give you more than a 30 day supply so.

PATIENT X369
That's fine.  Just so you might have an insight for other patients.

DOCTOR X369
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X369
When people who have the PTSD and that anxiety, when we have to go over to the Medical Clinic there are some doctors that treat us like pariah because of that.

DOCTOR X369
Really.

PATIENT X369
It just happens.  When I had, after my first neck surgery I told them something wasn't right and one of the attendings from Neurosurgery said, no from Ortho, he said maybe we need to send you back over to the Mental Health so that you can actually see what's really wrong with you.  Then next week Neurosurgery checked it out and they put me, I had surgery within a couple weeks after that.

DOCTOR X369
Hmm.

PATIENT X369
So I have a hard time with anything going over to Mental Health.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
Because of that stigma that.  I'm by far, I'm not crazy.

DOCTOR X369
No, no, no.

PATIENT X369
You know when other doctors treat me like that.

DOCTOR X369
I know.

PATIENT X369
It makes me not want anything to do with that malarkey. 

DOCTOR X369
Not the system, but here, Mental Health here is really good.

PATIENT X369
Oh yeah I know they're good.

DOCTOR X369
With like, even when it comes to basic anxiety to like severe depression.

PATIENT X369
My thing is um.

DOCTOR X369
But they treat everybody.

PATIENT X369
My thing isn't so much with the Mental Health.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
It's with the other doctors who treat patients like.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
Well he's still in pain because he's crazy.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
That's, that's just too much.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah I understand.

PATIENT X369
You know I'm a highly educated person; I don't appreciate being called crazy because I'm in pain.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X369
You know by somebody who's never served a day in his life in the military.

DOCTOR X369
Do you teach AP chemistry?

PATIENT X369
I do not teach AP.  I prefer conceptual chemistry so I teach the general level.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
But at the school I teach at my conceptual general level can beat most of the AP levels in most schools in the state.

DOCTOR X369
Okay great.

PATIENT X369
Neighbor go north is no joke when it comes to science.

DOCTOR X369
So @@@ oh really.  Those kids are really smart.  

PATIENT X369
That's who I teach.  

DOCTOR X369
Wow.

PATIENT X369
All the really, really smart ones.

DOCTOR X369
Do you teach any of the Indian kids cause @@@.

PATIENT X369
I do, I do.  I'm also a model UN advisor.

DOCTOR X369
Oh really oh wow.  I did not know that.

PATIENT X369
And we'll be teaching applications in chemistry.

DOCTOR X369
@@@ are not funny.  @@@.

PATIENT X369
No.

DOCTOR X369
I feel like you don't make enough.

PATIENT X369
I have to live in xxx xxx for what I make.

DOCTOR X369
Really.

PATIENT X369
And it bothers me too, especially when the.

DOCTOR X369
I always had teachers because like in India teachers are highly regarded.

PATIENT X369
Regarded exactly.

DOCTOR X369
Like our doctors, lawyers and teachers are like.

PATIENT X369
Well it's in a monarchy system that's the way it is.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah, teachers are like, cause my grandfather was a principal.  He was a science teacher back in India but then became a principal.  He was like the big dog in our little village, very respected um you know and it's like even here like doctors are like, there are sometimes greedy doctors demanding things over other countries I'm like okay you're just a @@@.

PATIENT X369
But no you have to realize though in some areas around here the doctors here aren't always.

DOCTOR X369
I agree.

PATIENT X369
The highest level.

DOCTOR X369
Right agree.

PATIENT X369
I mean when that guy said what he said to me I wanted to just knock him out.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.  I know.  @@@.

PATIENT X369
Which one?

DOCTOR X369
The Nexium.

PATIENT X369
Yeah.

DOCTOR X369
I just wondered after a while.  Do you still take Ativan?

PATIENT X369
What's Ativan?

DOCTOR X369
The lorazepam?

PATIENT X369
Lorazepam is the one for anxiety.

DOCTOR X369
Do you still take that?

PATIENT X369
That was as the as needed one.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.

PATIENT X369
You don't always need it but when you need it.

DOCTOR X369
I know.

PATIENT X369
You really need it.

DOCTOR X369
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X369
For my anxiety attacks I have difficulty breathing.

DOCTOR X369
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X369
And it's like fractured eyesight.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
So.  They tell me it's kind of near, well while they were testing me for um.

DOCTOR X369
That's okay.

PATIENT X369
So while they were testing me for, what's the one for low blood sugar, not hypoglycemia.

DOCTOR X369
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X369
They were testing for that cause they thought that's what it was.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
And then they eventually they finally, we narrowed it down and found out what it was.

DOCTOR X369
Do you want to pick this up?  @@@ the capsules?

PATIENT X369
I'd really appreciate it.  I haven't had one in months.

DOCTOR X369
You have, okay you know it takes six weeks for this stuff to kick in right?

PATIENT X369
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X369
@@@.

PATIENT X369
Oh yeah.  But I need to get something working cause I've been going downhill for a while.

DOCTOR X369
Do you have aspirin and do you have Tylenol?

PATIENT X369
I do have some but they usually order that.  They send that to me cause they said they had to.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
I don't know why but I have bottles upon bottles of that stuff.

DOCTOR X369
So I'm not gonna order that then.  Let me fill this out.  Were you ever taken off of the gemfibrozil?

PATIENT X369
No.

DOCTOR X369
You were never taken off.  And you're taking 600 twice a day? 

PATIENT X369
Yes.  And then they had Niaspan something, that's the one with the aspirin.

DOCTOR X369
Okay that one I do not see any refills.  Do you want to pick up the gemfibrozil?

PATIENT X369
I have plenty of that, that can be mailed.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
I'm still trying to go through the last bottle.  But the only reason that I had the aspirin was because of the niacin.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
But that stuff made me, when you take it, you take the aspirin and then a half hour later you take the Niaspan and then if I don't fall asleep fast enough I start itching from head to toe.

DOCTOR X369
Really.

PATIENT X369
It's like the weirdest frickin feeling.

DOCTOR X369
Do you want to pick up the Ativan, the lorazepam?

PATIENT X369
I definitely need it so I have to have that processed.

DOCTOR X369
So that you can pick up.  So that's all the medicine @@@.

PATIENT X369
You know what I think he was trying to get me off of that one I think because I told him I was itching so bad.

DOCTOR X369
So you don't want the @@@?

PATIENT X369
I don't really care for it one way or the other.  If I need it because my triglycerides are too high that's one thing but if I don't need it I would prefer not to have that itching.

DOCTOR X369
How about we'll check your labs today, if they're too high then we'll go ahead and mail it.

PATIENT X369
Yeah.

DOCTOR X369
Okay, how does that sound?

PATIENT X369
The last time I was with DOCTOR he had me take a blood test and one of the things was some PFT I think he said it was.

DOCTOR X369
PSA?

PATIENT X369
Something about prostate.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.

PATIENT X369
And what did they find out?

DOCTOR X369
It was normal back then.

PATIENT X369
I'm good.

DOCTOR X369
@@@.  You're too young to have anything going on with that.

PATIENT X369
You'd be surprised.

DOCTOR X369
You're too young.

PATIENT X369
I have a family history of that so I have to get a colonoscopy every two.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.  Okay.  We'll hold off on the biopsy okay.

PATIENT X369
I'd really appreciate that.

DOCTOR X369
So @@@ and the Ativan you can pick up today, the lorazepam I mean.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
And then the gemfibrozil will be mailed to you.  Um you had that familial hereditary polyposis.

PATIENT X369
Yeah polyposis yeah.

DOCTOR X369
Do you have it too?

PATIENT X369
Uh they said I was okay, I don't.

DOCTOR X369
They didn't find any?

PATIENT X369
I don't know what they found.  I don't always.  I don't always hear the results of what they do.  They said that.

DOCTOR X369
You are due for a colonoscopy in 2016.  Anytime between 2013 and 2016.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X369
I'll be 43 that year.

DOCTOR X369
Anytime between the age of 43 to 45.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.  Because I won't be @@@.  Alright, well let me.

PATIENT X369
Did they even find anything with the test?

DOCTOR X369
I'll probably give you the niacin because if you haven't been on any of that stuff, I'd say you need it okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X369
I don't even know, I can't remember.  All I know is that, I think it was like 750 or something.  It was some huge amount.

DOCTOR X369
Probably.  @@@.  Okay we'll just do @@@.

PATIENT X369
They tell me it was at night, take it before I go to bed so it flushes my system or something.

DOCTOR X369
And you take one pill at nighttime okay.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
Um @@@.  

PATIENT X369
That'd be awesome.  @@@ I know somebody that sounds just like her.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT X369
So when I leave here I go down to the uh Lab and have blood drawn?

DOCTOR X369
When you leave here yes.

PATIENT X369
And then get meds.

DOCTOR X369
Yes.

PATIENT X369
@@@.

DOCTOR X369
Do you drink at all?

PATIENT X369
Very rarely?

DOCTOR X369
Okay don't drink when you're on the Ativan okay.

PATIENT X369
I know, I know.  I don't like losing control so I prefer not to take anything that affects my control or who I am.

DOCTOR X369
Good.

PATIENT X369
My students say I have a touch of OCD.

DOCTOR X369
Really?  @@@ with that.

PATIENT X369
@@@.

DOCTOR X369
@@@.

PATIENT X369
Try being a teacher.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah you have to be really organized you know.

PATIENT X369
My student teacher just found that out this year.  She's freaking out.

DOCTOR X369
What?

PATIENT X369
About the organization required to be a teacher.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah it's hard.  @@@.  Do you teach multiple levels?

PATIENT X369
Right now I'm only teaching one @@@.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
But that's actually even harder because you don't know um what you're going through.  Like when they gather you don't know if you've covered everything in every period.

DOCTOR X369
Right.  Um so I'll be right back.  Let me take a listen.  Deep breath in and out.  And again.  Deep breath, one more.  Let me see your ankles real quick.

PATIENT X369
I got like weird coloration on my ankles.  

DOCTOR X369
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X369
They call it trauma boot @@@ but.

DOCTOR X369
Alright I will be right back @@@.  You are absolutely not interested in following with Mental Health even if it's over @@@ to talk to somebody?

PATIENT X369
It's so hard for me to go there.

DOCTOR X369
No, no, no, there's somebody that can talk to you over the phone so @@@ a psychiatrist.  So if there's any like, any issue that you ever want to talk to them for, I can like plug you in and they can maybe contact you.

PATIENT X369
That would be fine.

DOCTOR X369
It's @@@.

PATIENT X369
As long as it's not like.

DOCTOR X369
@@@.

PATIENT X369
I don't want the stigma that's the big thing.

DOCTOR X369
You don't even have to come in so it will be over the phone.  They'll call you @@@.  So that way you'll know what your options are.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
And what you could @@@.

PATIENT X369
@@@ it's just.

DOCTOR X369
That's fine.  It's very difficult.

PATIENT X369
Coming this far to.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X369
You know I live with a job, I teach and to come all the way over to @@@.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.

PATIENT X369
Only to have somebody place a stigma on you.

DOCTOR X369
Yeah.

PATIENT X369
It's, it actually I think increases the stress.

DOCTOR X369
I want you to talk have someone to kind of contact even if it's just to cope with the.

PATIENT X369
That'd be awesome.

DOCTOR X369
Okay I'll be right back.

DOCTOR OUT:  28:12   DOCTOR IN:  35:06

DOCTOR X369
Okay.  So I talked to my attending.

PATIENT X369
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X369
And @@@ okay.  I just wanted to explain, I know you go to @@@ that whole department.

PATIENT X369
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X369
Um the rules changed here because you don't actually have a diagnosis like depression or anxiety, it's what DOCTOR labeled you as right?

PATIENT X369
No that's what's there @@@. 

DOCTOR X369
Through here?

PATIENT X369
Yeah.

DOCTOR X369
A long time ago okay.  So it's something that we usually kind of have to abide by because can @@@ medications but we need like a pseudo or formal evaluation.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
So the rule is that either you have to follow a doctor, I think two or three times within a 90 day period and I'm only here once every five weeks basically, like I have clinic for five days then I'm off for four weeks and then a clinic for five days again okay.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
So it's like go for two or three phone calls but not to call you about.

PATIENT X369
I'm happy not to come.

DOCTOR X369
So you have to talk to them.

PATIENT X369
That's fine.  I don't, @@@ that's easy.

DOCTOR X369
And the only other thing is they, the only reason why honestly from our end that we want you to see them is you need the medication management.  Because they are well versed with monitoring for side effects and can titrate your medications appropriately.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
We know okay this medicine is for this but we don't know what these side effects are, we don't know how high should we go or how low should we go, when should we stop the medicine and all we are taught is depression you take Paxil, depression you take Elavil or whatever meds that are out there okay.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
So that's why.  It's not so much that.

PATIENT X369
Well the reason that they did it is I was on Paxil before and that's the only reason that he was able to do that.

DOCTOR X369
That's fine.  That's fine, that's okay but the rules have changed like I told you so that's the only reason why.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
It's not.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
And if you don't want us to get @@@.

PATIENT X369
I don't have a problem talking to them on the phone.

DOCTOR X369
No, no, no.  I think he wants to meet you.  You don't even have to meet him at the Mental @@@.  You could meet him here.

PATIENT X369
Okay.

DOCTOR X369
That's fine.

PATIENT X369
That I can do.

DOCTOR X369
Okay.

PATIENT X369
It's just, like I said it's just the.

DOCTOR X369
So like we're, I think his office is actually upstairs so I don't know about it.  Like if you really just would be meeting somebody, like really have a strong aversion to like going to that building but I don't mind meeting you in the main hospital somewhere in one of the clinics on the third floor.  I would tell him that.

PATIENT X369
And it's just, and it's just I don't have a problem talking to him @@@.

DOCTOR X369
I know.

PATIENT X369
I just don't like that stigma.

DOCTOR X369
That's no problem, it’s okay.

PATIENT X369
It just keeps me from getting in trouble.

DOCTOR X369
That's okay.  So one more thing that you're due for today is a vaccine called.

PATIENT X369
Which vaccine?

DOCTOR X369
Called TDAP.  Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.

PATIENT X369

DOCTOR X369

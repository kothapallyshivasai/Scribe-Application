DOCTOR X268
Oh I know, @@@.

PATIENT X268

DOCTOR X268
Yeah @@@ the 23rd.  When you're done here okay.

PATIENT X268
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah they decided to move the clinic.  Not that they don't have anything better to do but they just.

PATIENT X268
No um.

DOCTOR X268
Change things.

PATIENT X268
With you going.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
That's all you're gonna do is cancer research?

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
You're not coming?

DOCTOR X268
Not research, well cancer treatment and research.

PATIENT X268
Treatment okay, okay.

DOCTOR X268
I uh, I'm sorry.  I'd take you to my other clinic, if I could I would, trust me.

PATIENT X268
Well, okay, I guess I have to.  Who have you got us an appointment?

DOCTOR X268
I don't know yet.

PATIENT X268
Don't know yet.

DOCTOR X268
But if they're not good, you know what well, make sure, let's see if I can get you in with, well I'll try to get you in someone else's clinic.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
Now how are you doing?

PATIENT X268
Good, real good.

DOCTOR X268
I heard you were in the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X268
Yeah.  Uh this, whatever this is, there's got to be a disk hernia.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Everything is mimicking I guess that's the way to say it.  When I had the fusion done.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Everything is mimicking that.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
And now with that um uh I'm having these three and recently now, driving especially.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Okay will cause numbness.  If I lay on my stomach at night and usually I lay something like this.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
I guess you know when I get on my back cause the numbness sets in.  Now and I, one thing that does help is the wristlets, applying pressure.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Um prescribed, whatever they're called and they do help but it's not, I don't feel, that it's a complete cure.

DOCTOR X268
Right.

PATIENT X268
Um.

DOCTOR X268
Did they ever scan your neck?

PATIENT X268
Yeah.  They've taken a couple of MRIs and I don't know what the last MRI.

DOCTOR X268
MRI was March 29th.

PATIENT X268
Yeah I don't know what the results of that was.

DOCTOR X268
I'm trying to check something here.

PATIENT X268
But I did something to where this muscle spasms, oh doc you could actually see a knot on the side of my neck it was that bad.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
And if notice the time we were in the ER.

DOCTOR X268
How long did you wait?

PATIENT X268
Well no I mean.

DOCTOR X268
Oh.

PATIENT X268
3 o'clock in the morning.

DOCTOR X268
Oh.

PATIENT X268
We left Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning to come down here.

DOCTOR X268
Wow.

PATIENT X268
It was that bad.  Um yeah we drove in; we left there at 1 o'clock to come in.  It was, because it started, it actually started to affect my swallowing.  I went to take my gabapentin and I couldn't hardly get it down.

DOCTOR X268
Wow.

PATIENT X268
It was, but like I said you could see a knot on this side and one was starting on this side.  Um, the shot did help and the pills have helped but I think there's more to this than.

DOCTOR X268
So the MRI that you did at the end of March, the same person read the MRI back in August and it was unchanged from August but what it shows in August was a disk bulging, some narrowing of the canal.

PATIENT X268
Well that would be, that could be one thing right there couldn't it?

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Narrowing of the canal.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
And now on the MRI can they tell how much it has narrowed or not?

DOCTOR X268
Well they just kind of give it a degree of either mild, moderate or severe.  Some areas it's mild, other areas they're calling it mild to moderate, other areas they're calling it moderate to severe.

PATIENT X268
Yeah.  And maybe it's just the way, whatever I'm doing or something causes.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.  I don't know if you'd get any benefit from having you see the neck surgeons but I can certainly go talk to my boss.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
And see what she says, if she agrees with that.  Okay, the neck spasms, have they improved?

PATIENT X268
Yeah it has since like, whenever or it was in November when it happened before and I came in.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
And I had an appointment so I waited a day but I didn't have any appointments you know coming up soon until I had you so that's why we came in and again it worried me when I couldn't even hardly swallow.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
I mean it took quite a bit to get the gabapentin down and that's when I said nope we gotta go in.  Um that has helped; it's still sore right in here.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
This muscle right here, uh still sore.  Um I'm having right there uh, where it starts to hurt again and then again over here, same spot, that muscle right there down the side uh but as far as the severity of it no.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
It's really decreased.

DOCTOR X268
I mean how, so if I were to send you to the neck surgeon what they would find, they're going to look and see if surgery is something that you should have done.  Is that something that you want to consider doing?

PATIENT X268
It, at this point, I would consider it.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Maybe after we talked, after I talked with them no, but because of, I can't get, it not only affects, has been affecting.

DOCTOR X268
If it comes back, well let's put it this way.  If it's affecting you to such degree that it's at least worthwhile to see what they have to offer.

PATIENT X268
Yeah and see what they have to say yeah.  I agree.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Because again I didn't come running in here from Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah, no I know, it's not like you're live next door.  I would have said yeah he must have been in some major.

PATIENT X268
Yeah it was.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Serious, it was bad.

DOCTOR X268
Now have you seen Ortho here or no?

PATIENT X268
Uh, oh boy.

DOCTOR X268
Let me see, cause they're the ones I would send you to.  Let me see if you ever saw them here.  Okay they put in a consult for you, a request and they put in, they made an appointment, I bet they didn't tell you the appointment did they?

PATIENT X268
No.

DOCTOR X268
March 10th.

PATIENT X268
Gosh I try not to miss my appointments.

DOCTOR X268
I know its okay.  I will uh put in a new consult okay, that's why.  So okay, how are your sugars doing now?

PATIENT X268
Real good.  In fact with, you can tell the summertime or spring's here and the planting season and the farms.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Because every morning I'm getting up and I can see, the sugars are so far down um.  It's, I have to wait for a little bit to be able to.

DOCTOR X268
How low are they going?

PATIENT X268
They're okay, they're okay.

DOCTOR X268
No, no, tell me how low.

PATIENT X268
Well some of them are down in the 70s.

DOCTOR X268
Oh okay, 70s are fine.

PATIENT X268
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X268
But is it lower than 70s?

PATIENT X268
Uh there's been a couple of times uh during the day, during the day.

DOCTOR X268
How low?  Be honest.

PATIENT X268
I had a couple in the 30s.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
36 and 38.

DOCTOR X268
And what happened at those times, did you like not eat?

PATIENT X268
Yeah I was, I ate breakfast and then I worked, it was like 2-3 in the afternoon before I ate anything again and I knew it.

DOCTOR X268
You knew it okay.

PATIENT X268
The sugar was dropping so it was not the insulin is over, it's just.

DOCTOR X268
You weren't doing your part.

PATIENT X268
I wasn't doing my part.

DOCTOR X268
Okay that's fine.  Uh the only reason why we care to know how low these things can get cause if it happens regularly, high blood sugars, nobody wants high blood sugars.  So high blood sugars aren't going to kill you like that.

PATIENT X268
Right.

DOCTOR X268
Low blood sugars could, so if you are getting to a point where you're having it often.

PATIENT X268
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
70s is a normal blood sugar, just so you're aware.  Now people do get symptoms but it's not because they're getting symptoms of hypoglycemia because the sugar is 70, they're getting symptoms because their sugar had been like 180.

PATIENT X268
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
And now it's 70 and it's that jog, that change that is causing your symptoms, not the sugar number itself.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
Uh but if you, so you need to be aware that I know it's hard cause you're gonna be outside and doing all kinds of things but make sure you have a snack or something in your pocket because if those sugars get too low it could be dangerous.

PATIENT X268
Really, I didn't know that it was.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
Yeah high kills you in the long run and the low kills you, it can kill you in the short time?

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.  That's why I asked.

PATIENT X268
Okay then what I'll do is I'll just start carrying something.  I love the Lifesaver wintergreen candies so I'll just carry some of that with me.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah, just I mean just kind of have something every so often.

PATIENT X268
Yeah and it's, that's the only reason they have dropped is because of me not eating and you know you just don't want to quit, uh just a little bit longer and of course a little bit longer turns into a couple of hours.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X268
So.

DOCTOR X268
Exactly.  

PATIENT X268
Yeah.

DOCTOR X268
Now did you take all your medicines this morning?

PATIENT X268
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
And are you taking the simvastatin?

PATIENT X268
Yes uh-huh.  Um the reason, I run up the stairs.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
So I found out maybe that wasn't that long after I ran up the stairs.

DOCTOR X268
I'll recheck it, I'll repeat it don't worry about it.

PATIENT X268
I always take the stairs.  I don't take the.

DOCTOR X268
The other thing I was going to ask you is we; remember we increased your Neurontin or your gabapentin dose.

PATIENT X268
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
Did you notice any improvement with that?

PATIENT X268
Yes, yes.  It does seem to, it has made a difference yes.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Um mainly when I, when I really notice it is mainly at night.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
That's when, I guess it's cause you're relaxing and now the nerve endings are, you're not thinking about it, are you thinking about it now because throughout the day.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
It doesn't seem to as though I need it.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
But at night um, you can, that's when it and it has really helped.

DOCTOR X268
And are you doing 800 in the morning and night with 400 in the afternoon?  How are you doing it?

PATIENT X268
Okay I was doing one in the morning and then uh whatever it is four at night, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR X268
That's okay.

PATIENT X268
I.

DOCTOR X268
Okay so the gabapentin is 400 mg caps.

PATIENT X268
Yeah gabapentin.

DOCTOR X268
Okay so how many are you taking in the morning?

PATIENT X268
One.

DOCTOR X268
And how many in the afternoon?

PATIENT X268
None.

DOCTOR X268
None and what about the evening?

PATIENT X268
Four.

DOCTOR X268
Okay so that's.

PATIENT X268
And that's again, a lot of times that's the only way it seems and usually I take it about between 7 and 8 o'clock.

DOCTOR X268
Does it get you, make you tired?

PATIENT X268
Yeah uh-huh.  Uh and then finally the hands and the feet stop and mainly it's the hands and feet.  Uh a little, once in a while in the legs but uh.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
But then I'm able to sleep and I sleep all night.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Yeah.

DOCTOR X268
So those things have been working for you?

PATIENT X268
Yeah that's what, that seems to be working for me.

DOCTOR X268
Let's not fix it.

PATIENT X268
Yeah.

DOCTOR X268
Let's not fix something that isn't broken.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
Um okay and then I got to put in for you to see Ortho.  Now, we could get some basic x-rays of your neck.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
So they can see what the hardware is you have in there.

PATIENT X268
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
Where it is, the location and all that.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
Um but we don't have to repeat the MRIs or anything.

PATIENT X268
They may have x-rays of the neck.  It seems like I had some x-rays taken.

DOCTOR X268
I know.  They'll want it if it's too long ago.

PATIENT X268
So long, okay.

DOCTOR X268
To make sure nothing has happened in the meantime.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
Um.

PATIENT X268
Now in the wintertime, @@@ last time you said this would help.  I try and this last winter was just, I mean I didn't want to get outside to do nothing you know, it just was hard and then my son-in-law.  I got to tell you what my son-in-law did here, back in March uh, no, no it wasn't, it was back in February.  We had that one snowfall.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.  I'm listening, just looking at what to order stuff and what not.

PATIENT X268
Um anyway he called me once and yeah we had a pretty good snowfall here and had a problem and we got stuck.  He said yeah, he says I know.  He said you know what I got stuck today also and I said you got stuck; they live in @@@ Florida which is xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Okay.  You got stuck, he drives for xxx xxx but down there xxx xxx of part of the state and they get all state benefits.

DOCTOR X268
Oh.

PATIENT X268
Yeah anyway and you got stuck.  He says yeah I got stuck in 75 degree weather today, yeah now that the sun's going down it's only 60 and I got out.  Okay that was when it was cold up here you know.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah, it really was yeah.  Now the blood work we won't do until you see um Endocrine.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
That they're going to do anyway.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
And let me see what else.  Let me see how you're doing on your refills.  I'll give you cyclobenzaprine.

PATIENT X268
Yeah that's the one.

DOCTOR X268
So you've been using it?

PATIENT X268
Yeah I almost forgot.  I don't remember it from the first time.

DOCTOR X268
Oh.

PATIENT X268
Yeah he gave me a prescription here when I was in and that has helped.

DOCTOR X268
It helped.

PATIENT X268
Yeah because it started in again and so um I, they had told me that the Pharmacy was open; the Pharmacy wasn't open, anyway.  So when we got home I found the old ones and I got, my fault, I did not know that they had come.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Anyway so I started taking them again and then I got the other ones in the mail and sure enough it went back down again so it um did help, it's helping yeah.

DOCTOR X268
Okay good.  Uh your simvastatin expired so I'm going to renew that.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
The insulin syringes, do you use those still or no?

PATIENT X268
No, stopped.

DOCTOR X268
No okay, well we'll just.

PATIENT X268
The 30 and 31 syringes no.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah, we'll discontinue.  @@@ to have your @@@ remover liquid.

PATIENT X268
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
You do use that?

PATIENT X268
Uh-huh.  Yeah I still got enough right now, unless it's, uh I still got half a bottle, one of those bottles like.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
That, about like that, I still got about half a bottle.  Cause sometimes these.

DOCTOR X268
So we'll renew it.  What about the nasal spray, do you use that?

PATIENT X268
No uh uh, no.

DOCTOR X268
Discontinue @@@.  Okay what about the Claritin?  Loratadine that's the antihistamine.

PATIENT X268
Well that must be over because.

DOCTOR X268
It's been over a year.

PATIENT X268
Yeah, yeah I'm going to say that must be old.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.  Alright so you've got a good number of refills.  

PATIENT X268
I wanted to ask you something.  I'll wait till you're done.

DOCTOR X268
Shoot.

PATIENT X268
What is this?

DOCTOR X268
What?

PATIENT X268
That little spray, as it is right now.

DOCTOR X268
Oh this here.

PATIENT X268
And it'll open up, I'll put some, usually I put bag balm on them, put a band-aid on them and it heals up in a day or two and that's the only spot and yet you can kind of see how bumped up, it never goes down or anything.

DOCTOR X268
Hmm.

PATIENT X268
Always a bump as though it's healed.  Is that and it's been like that for, I can't tell you how long.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.  It's sometimes the skin, for whatever reason it just didn't heal like back to normal the way it should be.

PATIENT X268
And so, with working, especially right now.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
It seems to be okay for two or three months and then I'll be doing something and right now it's gross, going out of town someplace because you're hot, cold and working out so okay.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah I wouldn't worry about it.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
It sometimes, you know with diabetes you get poor wound healing and then if it doesn't heal like it should, its fine.

PATIENT X268
And that was my main concern just because of the diabetes so.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
Uh.

DOCTOR X268
Well if it were to like continue to be a problem then we'd have to you know.

PATIENT X268
But if you know it heals up.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Um, bag balm, that kind of thing um, @@@.  Do you know what it is?  Whatever, have you heard of it?

DOCTOR X268
Uh uh.

PATIENT X268
It's an old remedy, that's one new one.  It's folic acid um, I forgot what I was saying but it's actually you put that on something like this.  The reason I didn't because I was going to show you today uh, within two days it'll get healed.

DOCTOR X268
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X268
Any sore.

DOCTOR X268
It's not like a red.

PATIENT X268
No it's a um yellowish.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.  It doesn't have Mercury does it?

PATIENT X268
No, no.

DOCTOR X268
Okay so I remember once I had this blister on my thumb that would not heal.

PATIENT X268
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
And I went to Italy, I was there for six weeks and aunt goes oh let me just try this stuff and she puts this stuff on it and it like the blister healed right away right, within a couple of days and so when I came back I had the opportunity to tell one of my friends who's a doctor.

PATIENT X268
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X268
And I'm like this stuff works miracles, blah, blah, blah and she goes yeah uh the government pulled that off the market cause it's got high Mercury content and I'm like oh for goodness sake.

PATIENT X268
I'll tell you a story, when I was oh 12, 14 years old, we were at my grandparents.  I won't tell you how it happened because I was stupid as a kid but I cut my bottom of my foot wide open.  My brother and I was playing on a tin roof.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
Anyway, I'm going, we went in and my brother and I and I'm bawling my eyes out you know and my grandmother said to my mother and that's all I heard, xxx get the turpentine and I went blood-footed, I went running.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
But do you know, I never had any infection.  They finally tackled me, got me.  I thought it was going to burn and it was going to hurt, it never hurt.  Grandma soaked my foot in there and I didn't even know, oh several minutes and then bandaged it with the turpentine.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
And it healed; uh of course I used to heal fast until the diabetes.

DOCTOR X268
Right.

PATIENT X268
But I never had a scar or anything.  You can't find anything and it was, it seemed to me even as a kid, as bad as the cut was.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
Uh turpentine and it never burned.  I was baffled.

DOCTOR X268
It's amazing.  It's amazing the stuff that that we used to use.

PATIENT X268
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X268
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Well, it's the first time @@@.

DOCTOR X268
Looks good huh.  Okay, it's better.  It's 130/60.  @@@.

PATIENT X268
Yeah usually I've got that talking one.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
That I had for my brother before he died and whenever I take it, so that's about what it runs.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.  Deep breaths.  Okay, just breathe regularly.  

PATIENT X268
Question.

DOCTOR H327
Yes.

PATIENT X268
When you were on this side, I know you listen to the heart.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
But what are you listening to on this side?

DOCTOR H327
The heart sounds.

PATIENT X268
Oh really.

DOCTOR X268
You can hear the heart sounds go to various places on your chest.

PATIENT X268
Really.

DOCTOR H327
Yep.

PATIENT X268
I did not know that.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.  Any swelling?

PATIENT X268
Nope uh uh.  I have a question.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
You were just saying that okay the neuropathy in the feet.  I don't like it's from the diabetes, never gonna get better okay.  But there's time when it seems its worse and then times when it's better okay.  It's not the neuropathy that's gonna have them cut my uh.

DOCTOR X268
Your.

PATIENT X268
We just had a friend here.

DOCTOR H327
Was getting an amputation?

PATIENT X268
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X268
So it's not the neuropathy but what it is is, it's the neuropathy cause like you don't feel the way you should so you're more likely to get um, to step on things, get cuts whatever.  Now when you get those sorts of cuts and what not, then it's hard for the wound to heal and if the blood flow to the limbs is lessened, which it can be with diabetes, it just doesn't allow it to heal and it continues to fester and then it just gets worse and worse.

PATIENT X268
That's what happened. 

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
A friend of ours, just a month ago had some, first it was just some toes and then they took her leg off up to her knee because she didn't listen, actually a friend of NAME.  It was too late.

DOCTOR X268
Right.

PATIENT X268
It was too late by that time.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Uh well when she finally did and the only thing that I have with my feet is the nail on the second toe and there seems to be a tender spot under it.  They looked at it at um.

DOCTOR X268
Podiatry?

PATIENT X268
Podiatry and didn't see anything.

DOCTOR H327
Okay.

PATIENT X268
Um and I didn't know if that was just maybe, maybe it's the toe, maybe it's the neuropathy.

DOCTOR X268
It's just.

PATIENT X268
That I'm making it feel that way.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
But as far as anything else and it just, doc it scared me when.

DOCTOR X268
You know as long.

PATIENT X268
It's right here.

DOCTOR H327
As you're not walking around barefoot, walking and stepping on you know rusty nails, things like that.

PATIENT X268
Yeah.

DOCTOR X268
As long as you are always keeping an eye on your feet and looking at them, making sure that you don't hurt them, you're fine.

PATIENT X268
She checks them every night.  Uh I won't even walk around the house, I have a set up there are sandals that when I come in and take off my shoes or boots or whatever.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
Um on goes the sandals.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
That way cause we have three little dogs, two little Lhasa Apsos and a miniature Schnauzer, who I don't know why but they don't understand they have to put their toys away.  They get them out with no problem.

DOCTOR H327

Oh.

DOCTOR X268
You know @@@ yeah.

PATIENT X268

DOCTOR H327
If the, you're kidneys are kind of also part of your how your blood pressure @@@ so the depending on those it can cause hypertension.

PATIENT X268
Okay sure.

DOCTOR X268
Yep but that's um, that's not a very common cause.

PATIENT X268
Hmm, I thought the kidneys you know went along with the liver taking care of everything and sort of filtering and but yeah it makes sense.  It makes sense I mean, if you've got something, especially of the kidneys.  I mean they're a big thing with the blood.  Yeah.  Will you do me a favor?

DOCTOR H327
Sure.

PATIENT X268
When I mean personal, it's about this cancer thing.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
And I hate to say this and I know.

DOCTOR H327
Just ask me.

PATIENT X268
Is this, is this, other cancers that are curable that they just don't want to.

DOCTOR X268
Tell you about?

PATIENT X268
Yeah.

DOCTOR H327
No.  There are cancers that are curable provided they're found early enough so it's all about screening and early detection.  So.

PATIENT X268
@@@.

DOCTOR X268
Yeah so the problem is that a lot of cancers, because we don't repeatedly check.  You know pancreatic cancer; there are certain types of cancers where you're a goner.  So essentially I don't care what.

PATIENT X268
Why can't, if they can transplant a heart, a kidney, a liver, everything.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT X268
Why not a pancreas?

DOCTOR X268
Because the thing is that by the time it's found it's so advanced that it's infiltrated all the areas surrounding it.

PATIENT X268
Okay you know I had heard that and uh, now it doesn't seem right but is that what it is?

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
But I thought like, xxx Swayze, I thought that they had diagnosed his early what not early enough.

DOCTOR X268
The pancreas is one of those where.

PATIENT X268
Here and now, it's gone.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah you're um.

PATIENT X268
Wow, wow.

DOCTOR X268
It's.

PATIENT X268
Okay somebody like me, my pancreas is not working right.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
I mean that's why I'm taking insulin.

DOCTOR X268
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Why can't they do a transplant on me?  I've heard over there at MCV at the Commission for the Blind, there's a girl there who is a diabetic who they did a cornea transplant on.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR X268
I haven't heard of pancreas transplants, they haven't done that yet.  

PATIENT X268
Why?

DOCTOR H327
I don't know.

PATIENT X268
I'm sure there's got to be.

DOCTOR X268
I really don't know to be honest with you.  I'm sure they're looking into it.

PATIENT X268
Yeah.

DOCTOR H327
But I've not heard of it so in terms of it being something that they're offering.

PATIENT X268
I can't imagine.  I don't know how like with a heart or a kidney.  I don't know how you would fit.  How do they sew that stuff together?

DOCTOR X268
Yeah I know it's amazing.

PATIENT X268
I mean who thinks this stuff up you know?

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X268
I just, but I remember when what's his name xxx Shaw, the first heart transplant, the name was xxx, maybe that might have been the last name.

DOCTOR X268
I can't remember the name.

PATIENT X268
Yeah I doubt.

DOCTOR H327
They've come a long ways.

PATIENT X268
That was, that was space age.  Uh that was Buck Rogers and then some yeah.

DOCTOR X268

PATIENT X268
Uh and he didn't live all that long but it was still, it was still uh.

DOCTOR H327

DOCTOR H327

DOCTOR H327
Well.

PATIENT X268
You've given me the incentive, you have.

DOCTOR X268
Well I'm glad.

PATIENT X268

DOCTOR X268
Okay so if you need anything you call.

PATIENT X268
Okay.

DOCTOR H327
Afterwards just e-mail, call me, I don't care okay, seriously.  Um and then otherwise we'll get you to a physician in either of these clinics, if they can't then they'll put you in whoever is taking over for me.  Okay.  If for whatever reason you don't like the new doctor you get, just switch to a different doctor.  Okay just ask for a new doctor.

PATIENT X268
You know it'll be.

DOCTOR X268
I don't, that's the deal.  So we just that's the problem, if you don't like who they gave that's why you make a request for a new physician okay.  Well and I know you told me.  You can ask @@@ to follow you as well.  It's not a problem.  @@@ don't by fooled by the @@@.

PATIENT X268

PATIENT X268

PATIENT X354
Good morning.

DOCTOR X354
Hi.

PATIENT X354
Are you looking for me?

DOCTOR X354
Are you PATIENT?

PATIENT X354
Yes I am.

DOCTOR X354
Hi, nice to see you again.

PATIENT X354
Nice to see you too.

DOCTOR X354
Come on back.

PATIENT X354
Come on NAME, I'll take the coffee.

SECOND PERSON X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
And your book.

SECOND PERSON X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
So let's go here.

PATIENT X354
How you doing today?

DOCTOR X354
I'm doing well, how are you doing today?

PATIENT X354
Not too bad.

DOCTOR X354
@@@, you look pretty good.

PATIENT X354
@@@.

DOCTOR X354
Come on in.  

PATIENT X354
Wow they keep it so cool in here.

DOCTOR X354
It is cool in here yes.  It's better than it was in the winter though I'll tell you that.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Um how are things going?

PATIENT X354
Well you know, as good as could be expected.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  I think the last time I saw you was in November in the fall.  Anything new for me, you concerned that needs to be?

PATIENT X354
Well you know you uh prescribed me that magnesium pills didn't you?

DOCTOR X354
I did.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Everything looks better.

PATIENT X354
I know but then they sent me another bottle.

DOCTOR X354
Oh they did.  You can stop taking that.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
Okay that's something I wanted to ask you because I been taking them.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
And I'm almost done with the second bottle.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.  Well let's look at your labs.  You just had labs done in March.

PATIENT X354
Right.  I had, my primary doctor said everything was perfect.

DOCTOR X354
Everything looks fine.  Your magnesium came back up to normal so no more pills, we'll just keep an eye on it.  But don't throw them away.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Because if we do labs say in six months and you're really low again then I'll have you restart them so you need to keep those ones but for now don't take those anymore.

PATIENT X354
Now I got a question for you.

DOCTOR X354
Go ahead.

PATIENT X354
You know I have horses, horses.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
And you know when I check @@@ it acts up.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
Now when I was taking the Advil it would, it would take care of the foot.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
Now that you got me on the Tylenol.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
It doesn't do such a good of job.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
So would it be okay if I bought some Advil and just take them when I get the @@@?

DOCTOR X354
Here's the problem Advil is a medicine that affects your kidneys.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
And you already have a little bit of kidney dysfunction.

SECOND PERSON X354
Not supposed to take Advil.
DOCTOR X354
So no Advil.

PATIENT X354
Oh alright.

DOCTOR X354
But we can try something else if the Tylenol's not working.

PATIENT X354
Well it works but I have to you know, like I can take them when I @@@ now you know.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  Uh.

PATIENT X354
I mean I don't know if that's good or not.

DOCTOR X354
I mean it's not, you take one Tylenol pill?

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Okay you take.

PATIENT X354
But when I add the @@@ then I take two.

DOCTOR X354
And what type of Tylenol are you taking, the regulars or the extra strengths?

PATIENT X354
I don't know.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  Um it's probably okay.  I mean you haven't had any issues with your liver but.

PATIENT X354
No the liver they say is good.

DOCTOR X354
@@@ yeah, no problems with the liver um and that would be the only reason to cut back on Tylenol.  But if the Tylenol's not working very well we could try you on something a little stronger for the pain.  Is it still that pain when you take a deep breath?

PATIENT X354
Yes and it shoots from my back to my front you know.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
It's terrible and plus you know we're having a hard time dealing with the asthma and emphysema, I'm really between a rock and a hard place when I get that flare-up with the um, what do you call it the, emphysema.

DOCTOR X354
The emphysema.

PATIENT X354
Not the emphysema.

DOCTOR X354
The gout?

PATIENT X354
Pleurisy.

DOCTOR X354
Oh the pleurisy okay.  Well so you take one Tylenol per night @@@.  I mean but it's working, the Tylenol's working okay?

PATIENT X354
Not as good as the Advil did though, see that's.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
But I'm not, you know I haven't, I didn't want to do nothing with the Advil till I talked to you.

DOCTOR X354
I'd prefer that you don't take the Advil.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
I mean cause I don't want your kidneys to get worse.

PATIENT X354
Yeah is there another kind of pill that you could prescribe for me?

DOCTOR X354
Well I think we should try to find something a little stronger that maybe will help with the pain when you need it.  Have you ever tried a medicine called tramadol?

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
So that one's a little bit stronger.

PATIENT X354
Actually I never had anything; don't think I've ever taken any medication for the pleurisy.

DOCTOR X354
Okay yeah.

PATIENT X354
I think uh when I first got it they gave me a penicillin shot or something.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
I got it when I was 20 years old; I mean I've had this thing for 50 years.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah, yeah.  Well we can try something a little stronger than Tylenol, uh being aware that trying a stronger pain medication can make you feel sleepy.  You're taking it when you're using the Tylenol.

PATIENT X354
I take yes.

DOCTOR X354
I was worried about that.

PATIENT X354
If you do give me one.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
I'll only take it at night.

DOCTOR X354
Which I think is fair.

PATIENT X354
You know cause I have a hard time sleeping anyway.

DOCTOR X354
So that might be one thing we can do and then if you have pain during the day I might stick with the Tylenol or try like a half a pill of the tramadol.  So I think that that might be a good way to.

PATIENT X354
So are you gonna give me a prescription?

DOCTOR X354
I will yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Um.

PATIENT X354
And if you could would you check and see if I need any prescriptions renewed? 

DOCTOR X354
Of course.  We'll go over all your medicines.

PATIENT X354
Well you write tiny.

DOCTOR X354
Well I have to fit four people on one page.

PATIENT X354
Oh they won't give you another page?

DOCTOR X354
Well I had a lot of sheets but I just like to save paper.  Any other issues going on?

PATIENT X354
No not really.

DOCTOR X354
Still not smoking?

PATIENT X354
Oh you're kidding me?

DOCTOR X354
Good, good.  Any changes in the living situation?

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
Home life alright?

PATIENT X354
No everything's fine.

DOCTOR X354
You're medication now; we've got down the Combivent inhaler, the albuterol ipratropium as needed.  I have you on the allopurinol for the gout.

PATIENT X354
Right.

DOCTOR X354
One pill a day.  Um and there's a azithromycin prescription in here, did you have an infection, a Z-pack?  Did they give you antibiotics any time?

PATIENT X354
Yeah you know, see what happens is this, with my asthma and emphysema and also I have bronchitis.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
When I catch a cold.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
It turns into pneumonia.

DOCTOR X354
Pneumonia okay.

PATIENT X354
So every time that happens, three times I had to come to the hospital.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
So I told my primary doctor I said you know whenever I'm in the hospital for pneumonia when I go home they give me prednisone.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
And antibiotics to bring me down from what I'm taking here.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
So I asked her to give me a prescription for at home.

DOCTOR X354
Gotcha.

PATIENT X354
So when I start feeling.

DOCTOR X354
In case you get a cold.

PATIENT X354
Yeah when I start wheezing like when I know that I'm having a problem.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
As a matter of fact, today I'm taking my last prednisone because uh about two weeks ago I had an attack.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
And it took me like almost a half hour to recuperate.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
So right away I start taking my.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
You know and then I don't have to be coming here because it's a hassle.

DOCTOR X354
I know and then you get admitted and it's.

PATIENT X354
Yeah and you know for me it's so hard because I don't get around very well.

DOCTOR X354
Right, right.  No I think that's a good plan.  @@@ off and on board.

DOCTOR X354
That's fine and then you have the formoterol inhaler um the one formoterol you only take once a day.

PATIENT X354

DOCTOR X354

PATIENT X354
Yeah they're really good.

DOCTOR X354
Okay and then the hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure once a day.

PATIENT X354

DOCTOR X354
Then lisinopril for blood pressure once per day.

PATIENT X354

DOCTOR X354
And you have the mometasone inhaler, with the formoterol and the okay, okay and then the omeprazole.

PATIENT X354
What is it?

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
It's the tiotropium. 

DOCTOR X354
Yeah that's this one you've got there.

PATIENT X354
The tiotropium.

DOCTOR X354
The tiotropium is Spiriva.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
So you should have four inhalers actually.

PATIENT X354
No, three.  Now I get that Combivent.

DOCTOR X354
Oh but yeah.

PATIENT X354
But the Combivent see.

DOCTOR X354
But that's as needed.

DOCTOR X354
Okay good.

PATIENT X354

DOCTOR X354
Okay that's good.

PATIENT X354
So you know those last a long time.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah right.

PATIENT X354
So I told them when I need it you know.

DOCTOR X354
Then you can call for a.

PATIENT X354
Then I'll call for a.

DOCTOR X354
@@@.  And then omeprazole you take it twice a day for acid reflux.

PATIENT X354
I take it once a day.

DOCTOR X354
Once a day.

PATIENT X354
It says twice a day but I take it once a day.

DOCTOR X354
That's fine and then the simvastatin you take one tablet at bedtime.

PATIENT X354
Simvastatin yes.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
That's for the cholesterol.

DOCTOR X354
And they have you on @@@ and a baby aspirin.

PATIENT X354

81 mg.

DOCTOR X354

PATIENT X354
I just take my pills every day.

DOCTOR X354
Okay well everything looks well controlled.  I can get you a cuff if you want to take it at home.

PATIENT X354

DOCTOR X354
A blood pressure cuff.

PATIENT X354
Naw.

DOCTOR X354
No, okay.  Well we'll just keep an eye on things here since it looks good.  Um and in terms of your lab tests, you know the only thing that I don't have.  Your cholesterol looks great um.

PATIENT X354
Yeah the good and the bad she says was good.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah both of them were good.  The liver we talked about was fine.  The electrolytes look better and then your kidney function's stable um.  The only thing we don't have for now is your blood count um.  Let me see when the last time we did a blood panel was.

PATIENT X354
What does that mean?

DOCTOR X354
So we measure the red blood cells and see if you have anemia.  We measure the platelets to make sure everything's stable.  It looks like you had one done in November and everything was fine so I'm okay with waiting and getting one next time I see you.

PATIENT X354
Is that one if it's bad I have to take a iron pill?

DOCTOR X354
Right yeah.

PATIENT X354
Yeah I was taking those a couple years ago and then they told me to stop.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah I mean everything looked real good in the last, before.  Everything was totally normal.

PATIENT X354
And that the reason.

DOCTOR X354
In December.

PATIENT X354
They told me to stop after I just got a new prescription sent to my house.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  Well keep those too.

PATIENT X354
I threw them out.

DOCTOR X354
Oh you did okay that's okay.  Okay well I need you to hop up on the table.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
And we'll do an exam.  

PATIENT X354
Now will you be my doctor?

DOCTOR X354
I'm here for a total of three years.

PATIENT X354
Oh.

DOCTOR X354
So I'll probably see you a few more times.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
So we get rotated around a lot.

PATIENT X354
I know.  That's when I get @@@ any time I have to deal with moving around.

DOCTOR X354
Do you mostly use a wheelchair at home?

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
No.  What do you use at home to get around?

PATIENT X354
I walk.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
But you know I do a few steps then I have to stop.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
You know I have to do them.

DOCTOR X354
Well the last time I thought we talked about the possibility of getting you a scooter.

PATIENT X354
Yeah you know what, I have one.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
That's @@@.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
She called me up @@@, how do you want to bill the various.

DOCTOR X354
Oh.

PATIENT X354
And then I tried calling her back and she doesn't call me back.

DOCTOR X354
Oh.  Well do you want me to put in another request for one or do you want to wait a little while?

PATIENT X354
Well let's wait a while.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  Let me just take a peek in here, say ah.

PATIENT X354
Ah.

DOCTOR X354
Now you've got a little bit of white on your tongue here.  That might be something because of the steroid.

PATIENT X354
Yeah I'm on my last one today.

DOCTOR X354
Let me take a peek at the tongue.

PATIENT X354
Ah.

DOCTOR X354
Just the tongue.  Now maybe that's more from the tongue okay.  Do you have any pain in the tongue?

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
I have some medicine at home for that.

DOCTOR X354
You do, the mouthwash stuff?

PATIENT X354
Yeah the yellow stuff.

DOCTOR X354
That you swish around and spit out?

PATIENT X354
No I swallow it.

DOCTOR X354
You just swallow it okay.  How much do you have at home?

PATIENT X354
I have about three bottles.

DOCTOR X354
Is it called Nystatin, does that ring a bell?  Nystatin?

PATIENT X354
I don't know.

DOCTOR X354
Okay when is it from?  Is it @@@.

PATIENT X354
No maybe, maybe I would say less than a year.

DOCTOR X354
Okay I want to see you here again in a few days.

PATIENT X354
Really?

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.  You @@@ on the tongue.

PATIENT X354
I did some @@@, you kind of.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah it could be, I mean you're also taking the oral steroids and that can cause.

PATIENT X354
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X354
So maybe the combination of both.

PATIENT X354
I see.

DOCTOR X354
So I want to check in the next week or two, @@@ and take a peek at your own tongue and see if it's getting better okay.  If it's not then call and let me know cause you need a prescription for Nystatin.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  Let me take a peek at your eyes.  Good.  Let me put this @@@ back on.  Just breathe normal.  @@@.  Good, good breath sounds throughout.  It doesn't look like I hear anything.  You need to follow up with our pulmonologist right?

PATIENT X354
That hurt.

DOCTOR X354
Back here.

PATIENT X354
Shrapnel.

DOCTOR X354
No pain in your spine or lower back?

PATIENT X354
No, no pain.  No pain whatsoever.

DOCTOR X354
We're gonna have you lay back and I'm going to take a peek at your belly.

PATIENT X354
Ah.

DOCTOR X354
And bowel movements have been okay with your stool softeners?  With the stool softeners?

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
You do okay with that okay.  Nothing black or tarry or bright red?

PATIENT X354
What's that?

DOCTOR X354
When your stool is black.

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
Put your head up for me, just your head.  A little bit of a hernia here.

PATIENT X354
@@@.

DOCTOR X354
Just relax.  Any pain?

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  A little one at your belly button too.

PATIENT X354
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X354
But they told me about that.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah it's okay.  Let me know if you ever get, I'm sorry is there pain there?

PATIENT X354
That doesn't hurt.

DOCTOR X354
Hmm.  Up in this area?

PATIENT X354
Yeah this one.

DOCTOR X354
Okay have you had pain there before?

PATIENT X354
No.  I mean now that you're pressing there's something.

DOCTOR X354
Nothing okay.  Take a breath in for me and out okay.  Have you had a with an ulcer?

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
Peptic ulcer?  @@@.

PATIENT X354
No it's my appendix.

DOCTOR X354
You had your appendix out okay.  Okay good.  I'll have you sit up.  Now look over toward the @@@ here.  Hold your breath for me and let it out.

PATIENT X354
Okay I can't hold my breath too long.

DOCTOR X354
Okay we'll do it once more and just one breath in for me.  Good okay.  Alright come on back and have a seat.

PATIENT X354
I don't want to have a seat.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
Cause you see all that moving around just.

DOCTOR X354
Makes you a little bit short of breath.

PATIENT X354
Yeah @@@.  That's one of the reasons why I have the wheelchair you know cause I can't walk.

DOCTOR X354
Right I mean it's a long way in from the parking lot too.

PATIENT X354
So everything is pretty good?

DOCTOR X354
Yeah everything looks good.  Um are you still using oxygen at home?

PATIENT X354
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X354
How much are you on now?

PATIENT X354
Uh three units.

DOCTOR X354
All the time or at night?

PATIENT X354
Uh well most of the time.  Sometimes I don't use it.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
You know I'm okay with or without it.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
Cause you see here I don't use it.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
But I usually use at home when I make something to eat for myself.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
Well even a cup of coffee can make it, any movement you know.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
Even with the oxygen on.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
But they told me even though I did @@@ so.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.  Well uh especially at night it's probably good you know.

PATIENT X354
Well they told me make sure I sleep with you know, with the oxygen and I do do that.

DOCTOR X354
Good.

PATIENT X354
They told me when I'm just sitting watching TV that I don't, you know if I don't need it I don't have to use it.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah I do advise you, if you're sitting around during the day and you don't feel like you need it then just.  Sometimes your lungs do a little better if you work and breathe on your own.

PATIENT X354
Yeah, you know cause I don't want to really get hooked on it.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
But they told me that you can't so I don't know.

DOCTOR X354
You can become more dependent on it.

PATIENT X354
Yeah should I consistently use that?

DOCTOR X354
Let me, let me take a look.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
@@@.

PATIENT X354
You know the other problem is that I have is that like if I need something to call you but it's too hard to get hold of you doctors.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah I know but you can always call the Medicine Clinic and say I'd like to leave a message.

PATIENT X354
Is it the free 800 number?

DOCTOR X354
Yeah cause I need to leave a message um for my doctor and they'll be able to, if you don't remember my name like you say DOCTOR then they'll send me a little message and then we'll, I check my messages usually once every few days even if I'm working over at xxx and so I'll be able to call you back in a few days.  It's not always immediate, like I may not call you back the same day you call but it should be within about a week.

PATIENT X354
Well what happens if it's important?

DOCTOR X354
Well if it's really important @@@ then they'll probably just tell you to come in.  Cause the problem is that I'm not here every single day and I work intermittently over at xxx or here.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
So usually within a few days I'll be able to see any message.  If you have something acute going on like you call and say hey I'm really having trouble breathing can I come in and see someone they'll set you up with a different doctor.

PATIENT X354
Yeah see if I got over here that would be my @@@.

DOCTOR X354
Well @@@ at least call.  But let's say it's something else, okay you had some diarrhea or something and you wanted to be checked out, they can set you up with another doctor but it wouldn't necessarily be me.

PATIENT X354
Yeah at the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X354
Right.  If you want to you could come in for what we call an acute care visit and then you come in the clinic here but you'll see someone who's not me.

PATIENT X354
Oh up here?

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
So I don't have to go to the Emergency Room?

DOCTOR X354
Right, right and they'll set you up probably sometime, usually in a spot that same week and they'll say okay we'll put you in a slot tomorrow or Thursday or whatever it is and we're gonna have you see doctor so and so and you'll come in and all you'll tell doctor so and so is whatever's going on, hey.

PATIENT X354
Now see if I have to make that trip I'd just rather go to the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X354
We just encourage people not to go to the Emergency Room as much just because it overloads the Emergency Room if it's something that's not an emergency.

PATIENT X354
Oh I see.

DOCTOR X354
So by all means if you're having an emergency don't hesitate to come but if you're having like say three or four episodes of diarrhea a day for the last couple of days and you want to be checked out.

PATIENT X354
I'll take some Imodium AD.

DOCTOR X354
Well you could try that too.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
But if you want to be checked out, like if you're having belly pain, whatever it is or you're getting headaches or something.

PATIENT X354
Right.

DOCTOR X354
That's not an acute emergency, it's better to come to the clinic and get checked out in the clinic than to show up in the Emergency Room.  You tend to get, you know more complete care, we can deal with it as an outpatient, it's not putting so much cost in the system so it's better to come here if it's not a true emergency.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
You know cause we can get you all the same things up here.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Do you want refills of your antibiotics and your prednisone?  Do you want me to renew those in case you need to order more?

PATIENT X354
I called my nurse upstairs.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
NURSE.  See my pulmonary doctor, she's having a baby.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
She's on maternity leave until June 1st.

DOCTOR X354
Oh I see okay.

PATIENT X354
And when I called she said that she would have her orders in but if you can order it for me go ahead and do it.

DOCTOR X354
I could put in for some refills.

PATIENT X354
Yeah do it then.

DOCTOR X354
Um.

PATIENT X354
Because uh like I said I'm gonna be taking my last pill today.

DOCTOR X354
So do they send this to you automatically?

PATIENT X354
Yeah they'll mail them to my house.

DOCTOR X354
And that's what you want?  You want it sent even when you're not sick you want it sent to your house?

PATIENT X354
So if I do get a cold I start taking it then.

DOCTOR X354
So let's get you some refills.

PATIENT X354
That's the prednisone and the antibiotics.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah, just only take it when you need it.

PATIENT X354
No uh yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Okay but.

PATIENT X354
Oh yeah I wouldn't take it if I don't need them, naturally.

DOCTOR X354
And if you need it, I don't know if you're gonna need to call the Pharmacy and let them know that they only can, have them only send one at a time cause you have one prescription.

PATIENT X354
They only.

DOCTOR X354
So they know that.

PATIENT X354
They put a non-refillable on the label.

DOCTOR X354
Okay, okay.  Oh well I'm just putting refills in then, so do you want refills?

PATIENT X354
No you have to order it, it's not a refill.  You have to order me the prednisone and the antibiotics.

DOCTOR X354
Well I have that, no I have it in but I put it in as refills and my concern is that they're going to just keep sending it to you.

PATIENT X354
No they won't.

DOCTOR X354
They won't okay.

PATIENT X354
So no because it's a non-refillable prescription.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
I only can get it when the doctor orders it for me.

DOCTOR X354
Oh I see okay.  Alright.  Well if they do send you too much just call them and say I don't want.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
I don't want anymore.

PATIENT X354
I know.

DOCTOR X354
Um okay, just a quick screening here.  Looks like the colonoscopy is not until June.

PATIENT X354
I don't want another one.

DOCTOR X354
You don't want another one.

PATIENT X354
No.

DOCTOR X354
Well it's not due yet anyway so you won't have to worry about it.  PSA was already checked.  We talked about smoking.  So you did have, what looks like a dilation of the aorta.  They did an ultrasound at some point and they saw that the aorta was a little bit dilated, now let me see the last report.

PATIENT X354
I don't want no more CAT scans.

DOCTOR X354
It's not a CAT scan, this is an ultrasound.

PATIENT X354
I'm sick of them.

DOCTOR X354
Um this one is might be here, let me see here.  It was done in 2010, let me see here.  Here we go.  Okay I think we might want to at least re-look at the aorta.  It's not a CAT scan; you don't go through any machines.  We'll schedule you for an appointment and they'll come and it's just that, it's like what they give to pregnant women, with the little gel and the stick and they go like this.

PATIENT X354
So what's that for?

DOCTOR X354
Um so the aorta, which is the largest vessel that runs down the middle of your body, sometimes, especially in men who have any history of smoking at all, it can become a little bit enlarged and the problem with that is that if it becomes enlarged it's a little bit increased risk for the wall being thin and it potentially tearing.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Um and because it carries a lot of blood that would be very dangerous when that happens, so screening all men who have any kind of history of smoking in their past and see if it's enlarged and if it is we keep an eye on it.  It looks like yours was a little bit enlarged in 2009.  I'm trying to see if we did another one um but I don't see it on record.  So I think it might be a good idea to get another one and see where it's at.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
If everything's stable we can just watch it.  If it's getting any bigger I'll probably have you see a vascular doctor, someone who deals especially with the blood vessels.

PATIENT X354
And what do they have to do?

DOCTOR X354
Well they may do nothing.  They may just watch it for us.  But if it's really big they may have some intervention which you may or may not decide you want but that's something that you could discuss with them.  But it's good to have a specialist take a look at it if it is enlarged just so they're aware of it and we all know about it and they can tell us how often we need to take a look at it.  Okay, it's a very easy test initially that's going to do that.

PATIENT X354
Yeah I know yeah.

DOCTOR X354
And then we'll see what it looks like.

PATIENT X354
They do that in Room 109 right?

DOCTOR X354
Okay I'm not sure.

PATIENT X354
Pretty.

DOCTOR X354
So let me get that ordered for you and they'll schedule that for you in the next, probably next couple weeks, let me see @@@.

PATIENT X354
Try to make it for like an early afternoon.

DOCTOR X354
They'll ask you when you want it.  I don't have any control over the schedule but they'll ask you when would be good for you.  And then let's see here, the magnesium is better so we'll take that one off.

PATIENT X354
So I can stop taking the pills but don't throw them away.

DOCTOR X354
Correct and we'll get another check in about six months and see where you're at.

PATIENT X354
Yeah I only have about 20 left.

DOCTOR X354
@@@ look fine; let's just see if we've got any other reminders in the computer here.  Okay did we talk last time about a Living Will and Advanced Directives?

PATIENT X354
Well I'm going to leave everything to @@@.

DOCTOR X354
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X354
Cause.

DOCTOR X354
Well it's more so.

PATIENT X354
I don't have.

DOCTOR X354
But it's more that a Living Will actually designates what you would want done for yourself in case of a medical emergency.  So if your heart were to stop or your breathing were to stop.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Do you want aggressive measures to bring you back?

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  So in that case it's actually very important that somebody, not only does someone know about this, so someone close to you, whose considered your Power of Attorney, know your wishes but also you keep a written record that you have said you don't want aggressive measures done because otherwise our default is we do everything to keep someone alive.  We don't want to go against anyone's wishes.

PATIENT X354
Yeah well you know, in my condition if something drastic happens.

DOCTOR X354
Sure.

PATIENT X354
You know.  Just hope I go to heaven and don't go the other way.

DOCTOR X354
So it's just yeah, it's just important that um, it's just important that we know what your wishes are.  So it's good to have it written out.  It's good to bring a copy of that so we can put it in your computer records.

PATIENT X354
I thought I sent something out one time.

DOCTOR X354
Maybe you did, I'll look back and see if we've got a form in here, let's see let me check.  The other thing that we are now recommending for all vets is an HIV test if you don't have one on record already.  We recommend them now for people with or without risk factors so you have a baseline.

PATIENT X354
Yeah that was a blood test they take.

DOCTOR X354
Well we would need to draw another little; a separate test to test is specifically for HIV so it'd be a little bit more blood.  It's not an urgent matter so if you, if you accept this and you want to do it I can put it in for your next blood work.  You also are welcome to decline it if you don't want it.

PATIENT X354
No we can do it, I don't, you know.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  So let me put it in.

PATIENT X354
Well what does it hurt?

DOCTOR X354
It doesn't hurt anything.

PATIENT X354
Right.

DOCTOR X354
Um why don't you, do you want to just do it the next time we draw blood from you?

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
Yeah, no I don't want to go down there now.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah let's do it just the next time we get some blood from you.  Alright.

PATIENT X354
Then this way, you know once they stick me then they could do whatever they want.

DOCTOR X354
I'm going to put everything in for November and I'll see you back here then.

PATIENT X354
Alright.

DOCTOR X354
Alright.

PATIENT X354
I thought they would check all that with all the blood they take.

DOCTOR X354
So I have to put in an order to check it.  They don't automatically.

PATIENT X354
Oh.

DOCTOR X354
I put in all the orders for all that blood and when you have tests they don't automatically do it.

PATIENT X354
Oh.

DOCTOR X354
So I have to put in a specific order and they'll draw special little tubes.

PATIENT X354
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X354
So they can send it to the right place um.  Okay, well let me just go run everything by my attending and see if she has any other suggestions for us but we'll definitely talk about potentially getting you on something that's a little bit better for the pain, the pleurisy pain.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
To make you a little bit more comfortable.

PATIENT X354
Yeah, because it's terrible when I get that.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X354
Because you know, trouble with the breathing to begin with.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
And when I have the pleurisy.

DOCTOR X354
It makes it worse.

PATIENT X354
It makes you breathe hard.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X354
And then I'm between a rock and a hard place.

DOCTOR X354
I know.  I know.  Okay just stick tight for just a minute; I'll be back in a few minutes okay.

PATIENT X354
Thank you.

DOCTOR X354
You're welcome.

(DOCTOR OUT:  50:54  DOCTOR IN:  61:00)

PATIENT X354
@@@.

DOCTOR X354
It's me, I'm back.  Okay.  So here's what we're gonna do, we're gonna give you some tramadol for your pain.

PATIENT X354
Well only when I get the pleurisy right?

DOCTOR X354
Only when you get the pain.  It'll make you a little bit sleepy so the first time you take it, you're gonna take it in the evening and make sure you're not going anywhere.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
I'm just gonna give you, I'm gonna give you 50 mg pills but try first cutting them in half okay and take just 25 mg and see if that helps your pain.  If not, feel free to take the whole pill.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  So we're gonna do um, you can take them up to every eight hours as needed but if you only need it at nighttime, just take it at nighttime.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Okay and I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you a 30 day supply which will be 90 pills.

PATIENT X354
Yeah because you know I'm not gonna be taking them every day.

DOCTOR X354
That's what I figured.  You want them to be mailed or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT X354
Yeah mailed.

DOCTOR X354
Fine.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
Yeah just send them to my PO box.

DOCTOR X354
Then um so.

PATIENT X354
Cause you know I don't live close.  I live like about 15 miles away.

DOCTOR X354
Okay so let's see.

PATIENT X354
I'm in xxx.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
I don't know if you know where that's at, that's near O'Hare Airport.

DOCTOR X354
Oh okay yeah sure I know where it is.  Alright I'm going to give you, do remember about the prednisone and the azithromycin, I'm gonna give you one more, maybe one more refill of them.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
And then after that, I want you, by then hopefully you won't you know need it any time soon, you just took it.  But after that I'm gonna have you call the pulmonary doctor and just double check everything with her and the other thing that I think might be sensible is if you feel like you're getting a viral infection or if you feel like you're getting a bad cough, if you feel like your COPD is acting up, you can come into the GMC Clinic, right here on the third floor without an appointment and be seen by one of the nurses, they can just see you and they can decide if you're wheezing that you really do need to take the prednisone or you need the azithromycin.  So it might be a good idea next time you start getting that cough, like when you have that coughing fit just to come in.

PATIENT X354
It's not a cough.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
It's just uh; I have a tremendous hard time breathing.

DOCTOR X354
So I think in that case then.

PATIENT X354
So I can't recuperate in a reasonable amount of time.  It's not a cough or anything.

DOCTOR X354
So in that case I think, when you have that problem again you should come in.  Come in to GMC or come in the Pulmonary Clinic and just have somebody listen to your lungs okay.  So that we kind of know what's going on and we can help you out if you, you know if you need more medicine or anything like that.  Just so that somebody's listening to the lungs and in terms of.

PATIENT X354
Yeah but then that defeats the purpose of me having the pills at home.

DOCTOR X354
Well that's, you know honestly I'd like to; I'd like to know when you're having the problem.  Cause I don't want to just keep having you take prednisone and.

PATIENT X354
I don't, I don't, I only take it.

DOCTOR X354
No, no, I know wait listen to me for just a second.  I don't want to have you just keep dosing for yourself when you've been doing that in the past because you may not be.  It may be just a short-lived thing that you don't need to take a whole prednisone course for because these antibiotics and the prednisone have lots of side effects themselves.  So if you don't need them I don't want you to take them but it's easier for a nurse or a doctor to assess whether you really do need to take the full course.  Do you see what I mean?  So I understand having the preventative medicines at home and I'm not saying we're not going to do that anymore.  I think it's been a good way to keep you out of the hospital but I think it'd just be a good idea for you to come in and be evaluated by either a nurse or a doctor, have someone listen to your lungs and make sure you're okay and then make a decision about whether you can take the antibiotics and the prednisone that you have at home.

PATIENT X354
See the only problem with that, I mean I don't have a problem with that.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
The only thing is that you know, in order for me to come here I need help.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
I can't just come here on my own and come in here you know.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
And I've always had the help, that's what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X354
I see what you mean.  Well if at all possible, my suggestion would be to be seen.

PATIENT X354
Yeah if it's possible I will do that definitely.  Cause I don't want to keep taking them if I don't need them either.

DOCTOR X354
Right exactly.

PATIENT X354
I just uh would rather do that than to come to the Emergency Room all the time.

DOCTOR X354
No and I think @@@ but rather than come in to the Emergency Room which you'll need help getting to anyway, have that person who would drive you here drive you to the clinic and someone can just listen to your lungs and that way you won't automatically be admitted to the hospital for potential pneumonia which is often what happens in the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X354
So I could just go right up to Pulmonary?

DOCTOR X354
Go right up to either Pulmonary Clinic or 3rd floor, just like right here.

PATIENT X354
They won't tell me to go to the Emergency Room then?

DOCTOR X354
They might if they see you sound really bad but they might not.

PATIENT X354
I mean without checking me out.

DOCTOR X354
Right.  Somebody will listen to you at clinic and they may be like okay you sound a little wheezy why don't you go ahead and take your Zithromax and go home but they might say oh you sound terrible, your breathing is awful, we're going to send you down to the Emergency Room but at least then you have a doctor checking you out or a nurse checking you out before you proceed straight to the Emergency Room.  I'd try to decrease the number of times you have to go to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X354
Yeah that's been my concern too.

DOCTOR X354
So that's what I want you to do when you start feeling sick.

PATIENT X354
Cause it's not easy when I'm having an attack you're right.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.

PATIENT X354
Cause sometimes, sometimes it's hard for me to get from the house to the car when I'm having an attack.

DOCTOR X354
Right and I'll I'm saying is that I think that it would be good for a doctor to evaluate you and better assess how your lungs sound.

PATIENT X354
I see.

DOCTOR X354
So I think the last thing I want to do is we're gonna get another EKG on you next time you come to clinic.

PATIENT X354
EKG?

DOCTOR X354
Yeah just take a look at the heart.  Sometimes the azithromycin is a medicine that can affect the heart a little bit.  You have one on record that looks okay but next time you come I want to do one periodically to make sure everything's stable okay.

PATIENT X354
And when is that gonna happen?

DOCTOR X354
So the next time you come to clinic in the fall um I want you to come, first stop on the 1st Floor, you'll see signs and you can ask somebody where the EKG Department is and they'll do a quick EKG and then they'll send it up here so I can take a look at it before I see you.

PATIENT X354
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  So the next time you come you're gonna get some lab work done and you're gonna stop by and get the EKG done.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Okay, make sense?

PATIENT X354
Now can you schedule me with a later appointment than 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning?

DOCTOR X354
So the latest I have is like 11.

PATIENT X354
That's fine.

DOCTOR X354
So just request from the folks at the desk, I don't schedule the appointments, they just schedule them for me.  So just request the clerk, when you check out at the desk.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
That you want one that's later in the morning.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Okay and they'll try to get you in like an 11 slot.

PATIENT X354
So I'll tell them you know next appointment make it for around 11.

DOCTOR X354
Right.

PATIENT X354
That's great because 8 or 9 is too early.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah.

PATIENT X354
I have something.

DOCTOR X354
Yeah I can't guarantee but they can do their best to get you in like at 11-ish okay.

PATIENT X354
Yeah.

DOCTOR X354
Alright.  So you're gonna come back in six months and then you're also gonna be scheduling you for that ultrasound of the aorta.

PATIENT X354
Okay.

DOCTOR X354
Okay and they'll let you know the date for that; they'll find something that works for you.

PATIENT X354
Good.

DOCTOR X354
Okay.  Well it's good to see you again.

PATIENT X354
Thank you.

DOCTOR X354
You take that and so don't forget to stop at the check out desk and they can make sure you get scheduled to see me again.

PATIENT X354
Okie dokey.  @@@ right?

DOCTOR X354
Yes @@@.

PATIENT X354
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR X354
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X354
Have a good day.

DOCTOR X354

PATIENT X354
Have a nice holiday too.

DOCTOR X354
Thank you so much, you too.

PATIENT X354

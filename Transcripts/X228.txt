PATIENT X228
Right and that should be okay.

DOCTOR X228
Okay that's good.  Uh alright and then you had some plaque in your cheeks I guess that they biopsied.

Oh that was Monday.

DOCTOR X228
Uh so you had not gotten it.  Cause I noticed some labs from December and uh the hemoglobin A1c was doing a little worse, it was up to 8.7.  You think that and I know you were in the hospital for something else; you had another bout of pancreatitis.

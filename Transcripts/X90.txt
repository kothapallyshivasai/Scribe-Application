DOCTOR X90
Now I just want to let you know, right here yeah.  The big thing is smoking um.  

PATIENT X90
Yeah.

DOCTOR X90
I can't stress to you know how important it is to quit.

PATIENT X90
I know, I know.

DOCTOR X90
We don’t know why you had a stroke.

PATIENT X90
Right.

DOCTOR X90
And on top of that you also had that chest pain @@@ cause a heart attack.

PATIENT X90
Yeah.  When was the @@@.

DOCTOR X90
No it was @@@ coronary arteries.

PATIENT X90
Oh okay.  @@@ stop smoking right.

DOCTOR X90
It's, so you have a bunch of arteries that run through your heart and it's a sign of heart @@@.

PATIENT X90
Right.

DOCTOR X90
Blood, @@@ heart muscle.

PATIENT X90
Right.

DOCTOR X90
After a heart attack if you have some plaque within those coronary arteries or cholesterol.

PATIENT X90
Right.

DOCTOR X90
And @@@ vessel wall and what happens is your smoking can cause clotting of the artery.

PATIENT X90
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X90
Causes a heart attack and kills the heart muscle.

PATIENT X90
Oh.

DOCTOR X90
@@@.

PATIENT X90
That changes everything.

DOCTOR X90
We caught yours before.

PATIENT X90
Yeah right, @@@.

DOCTOR X90
Before it causes the clot.

PATIENT X90
Yeah.

DOCTOR X90
And it's a good thing we did, but one of the reasons you had that is because you smoke.

PATIENT X90
Okay.

DOCTOR X90
So.

PATIENT X90
I'm not @@@ ready for that yet.

DOCTOR X90
You're at risk for another heart attack; you're also at risk for another stroke.

PATIENT X90
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X90
Um it increases your risk tremendously just by smoking.

PATIENT X90
Okay.

DOCTOR X90
On top of that your lungs, you know, 5-10 years down the road.

PATIENT X90
Yeah.

DOCTOR X90
That also have what is called emphysema.

PATIENT X90
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X90
COPD.  If you don't already have a little bit.  Now if you continue to smoke that'll just get worse.

PATIENT X90
I understand.

DOCTOR X90
If you stop smoking, any lethal damage to your lungs.

PATIENT X90
Will heal that right?

DOCTOR X90
It might not heal but the lungs won't get worse.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT X90
Yeah.

DOCTOR X90
And you're setting yourself for some major problems if you continue to smoke.

PATIENT X90
Okay.  I will quit entirely.  It's not worth that.

DOCTOR X90
Yeah, um.  Give me a couple of minutes and I will be back okay.

PATIENT X90

Um okay.  Are you having problems with erections?

PATIENT X90
Oh once in a while yeah.

DOCTOR X90
Is it sustaining an erection or getting an erection?

PATIENT X90
Sustaining.

DOCTOR X90
Cause the Viagra won't help with sustaining it.

PATIENT X90
@@@.

DOCTOR X90
It will help with getting an erection.

PATIENT X90
Okay.

DOCTOR X90
@@@.

PATIENT X90

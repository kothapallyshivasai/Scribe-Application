DOCTOR X473
PATIENT?  My name is DOCTOR, um I work with DOCTOR.  Um how you doing?

PATIENT X473
Not bad, how about you?

DOCTOR X473
Uh good.  It says the last time you were here you saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT X473
Right.

DOCTOR X473
He wanted to get @@@ and I understand you had the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X473
Yeah.

DOCTOR X473
And uh everything looked okay.  You had a polyp that will lead to cancer and so that.

PATIENT X473
That wasn't one of my better moments in life.

DOCTOR X473
Well, it's uh yes @@@.

PATIENT X473
Uh.

DOCTOR X473
But uh the next thing that you just need to have another one in ten years or so.  If you have more polyps than usually they want to keep the colonoscopies a little more frequently so and then you had any more chest pain?

PATIENT X473
Actually, I told them before I didn't really have chest pain.

DOCTOR X473
Just numbness?

PATIENT X473
Yeah my arm was going numb.

DOCTOR X473
Okay.

PATIENT X473
Cause you asked me if I could feel my arm.

DOCTOR X473
Okay.

PATIENT X473
And that's when I first decided it's time to go see a doctor.

DOCTOR X473
And you didn't see anybody before that for a long time?

PATIENT X473
I had one that said I was borderline high blood pressure and I saw him a couple of times @@@.

DOCTOR X473
Okay.  Alright and let me see what the, uh did you have a rectal exam the last time, do you know?  Because one of the things that uh we need to do to evaluate your prostate and you can do it a couple of ways by either measuring uh the level of your prostate-specific antigen, it's something they find in your blood and then also a digital exam where we examine your rectum.

PATIENT X473
I don't think I did.

DOCTOR X473
Yeah.

PATIENT X473
No, no.

DOCTOR X473
Is that something you want to consider it now?

PATIENT X473
Uh right now no.

DOCTOR X473
No.  Yeah uh at your next visit then we'll talk about it again.

PATIENT X473
Okay.

DOCTOR X473
And now you can think about it.

PATIENT X473
I don't really look @@@ do that.

DOCTOR X473
Okay.  It's something I don't think we have to do today.

PATIENT X473
Yeah.

DOCTOR X473
But we could do it next time too.

PATIENT X473
Fine.

DOCTOR X473
If you feel more comfortable with that and uh other than that, you know all your labs, everything looked perfect too but this was actually from before.  Okay and then do you check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X473
No.

DOCTOR X473
Uh do you check it whenever you go anywhere else?

PATIENT X473
No.

DOCTOR X473
Okay cause today actually you know it was 133/80 and then on repeat it was 149/98, you know sometimes its a little bit higher when you come to the doctor's office so for right now we can actually just continue with, you know just continue with are you taking the amlodipine?

PATIENT X473

PATIENT X473

DOCTOR X473
Oh good.

PATIENT X473

DOCTOR X473
Uh how about your tetanus?

PATIENT X473

DOCTOR X473
You don't know when you did it.  Has it been about 10 years?

PATIENT X473

DOCTOR X473
Do you want to get that today?

PATIENT X473
Why not.

DOCTOR X473
Okay.

PATIENT X473
I haven't @@@.

DOCTOR X473
Alright um take a seat okay.

PATIENT X473
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  38:38  DOCTOR IN:  43:12)

DOCTOR X473
Alright.  I think that uh one thing that we could do about your blood pressure right now is have you cut down on the amount of salt.

PATIENT X473
Sure.

DOCTOR X473
Do you eat a lot of salt?

PATIENT X473
No.  I never put it on anything.

DOCTOR X473
Do you eat a lot of.

PATIENT X473
But I do eat some beef jerky and stuff like that.

DOCTOR X473
Okay so a lot of processed foods, in fact about 80% of what we take in in terms of salts comes in from processed foods so it's not really what you add during your meals but if you could just try cutting back on.  Do you eat a lot of you know frozen foods?

PATIENT X473
Yep.

DOCTOR X473
So try cutting back on those things and that'll actually help and that'll bring your blood pressure down a little bit too and then we'll see where it is next time I see you.

PATIENT X473
Alright.

DOCTOR X473
Okay.

PATIENT X473
Okay.

DOCTOR X473
And today I'll send up the nurse to give you a tetanus shot, I don't know if she's still around so just give me a second while I find her okay.

PATIENT X473
Okay.

DOCTOR X473
And if not then you can just have that done the next time you come in.

PATIENT X473
Okay.

DOCTOR X473
Alright.  Alright so I don't see her so why don't we just plan on doing that next time.

PATIENT X473
Fine.

DOCTOR X473
Okay.

PATIENT X473
Yep.

DOCTOR X473
And you'll need to take this with you and they'll set up an appointment for you.

PATIENT X473
Okay and okay I was gonna ask about when you want to see me next.

DOCTOR X473
About six months.

PATIENT X473
Six months alright.

DOCTOR X473

PATIENT X473

DOCTOR X473
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X473
Okay.

DOCTOR X473
And then make sure that when you come back you get your labs drawn before.  You'll just stop at the, it's kind of diagonal to here, to get your blood drawn.

PATIENT X473
Oh okay yeah I know where it's at.

DOCTOR X473
Yeah and then uh.

PATIENT X473

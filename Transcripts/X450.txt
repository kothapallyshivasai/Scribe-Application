DOCTOR X450
PATIENT?

PATIENT X450
Yes.  @@@.

DOCTOR X450
Have a seat.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
Is this your first visit here?

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
First time.  Alright, let's see.  You've been to the ER, when was the last time?

PATIENT X450
I've been twice.

DOCTOR X450
Twice huh.

PATIENT X450
The first one was for chest pain.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
And then the second one, I'd had a headache for four days and it turned out was a severe sinus infection.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  Did they give you treatment for that?

PATIENT X450
Yes I'm taking uh antibiotics.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  Are you feeling better?  Is your headache feeling better?

PATIENT X450
Yeah the headache is gone actually.

DOCTOR X450
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X450
Uh you know I haven't, I haven't been able to really breathe out of my nose for the last ten years.

DOCTOR X450
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X450
And I've been to doctors uh and all they said was well you've got a sinus infection, they would give me antibiotic and no one would ever follow up including myself.

DOCTOR X450
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X450
And I just wanted.

(Knock on the door, doctor speaks with other person)

DOCTOR X450
Sorry.

PATIENT X450
No that's okay.  To make a long story short I haven't been able to breathe, really breathe or smell for almost the last ten years.

DOCTOR X450
Oh.

PATIENT X450
I've been basically mouth-breather for those years and uh the doctor was so great.  I mean I'm starting to smell again, stuff I haven't smelled for years.

DOCTOR X450
Oh really.  So you've been using a saline, that type of thing.

PATIENT X450
Yeah.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.  Alright.  Yeah so that's good.  So they just told you then, you just needed to complete those antibiotics?

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
But after that @@@ you kind of stopped @@@.

PATIENT X450
And I got off them the next day.

DOCTOR X450
Um the clindamycin, did they give you, how many days did you use do you think?

PATIENT X450
It was probably only about six days.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
I usually take 12 a day so.

DOCTOR X450
Right.  Okay.  But yeah the specific @@@ fair enough.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
Okay and that's gonna help drain things in the long run and the @@@ suffer so long. 

PATIENT X450
And it got to the point where my gums were swollen and I think they're starting to recede now.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
But over this time I had gotten to the point where I mean you could barely see my front teeth on the teeth.

DOCTOR X450
Yeah.

PATIENT X450
The gums were really bad.

DOCTOR X450
Yeah.  And uh I see that you had a chest x-ray I'm just trying to see what the results were.

PATIENT X450
yeah you now they called my house and gave it to my wife.  They told my wife something but I'm confused with what they told her or maybe she's confused as to what she heard.

DOCTOR X450
That's fine.

PATIENT X450
Um and I haven't been able to get hold of anybody to call me back.  Basically what I get out of my wife's message was that they found uh some type of irregularity but it's no big deal basically is what she said.  Um but I'm thinking if there's anything abnormal that's a big deal to me.

DOCTOR X450
Yeah, let me see what you might have.  So @@@ talk to you, you got time?  

PATIENT X450
From the stress test?

DOCTOR X450
Yeah.

PATIENT X450
It depends okay bring them down you know I don't know.

DOCTOR X450
Oh so it's high?

PATIENT X450
You know I work late.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
I work all night from midnight to 8.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
But if I'm working and my legs just start to give out I just sit.

DOCTOR X450
Well the good news is that you actually had a normal stress test.
 
PATIENT X450
Okay.  

DOCTOR X450
That's @@@ and I'm not sure what the abnormality they were talking about but there is a question on why they @@@ what they call poor R wave progression.

PATIENT X450
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X450
And uh @@@ at the end and I think that's probably what they think.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
So what's causing my chest pains?

DOCTOR X450
So let's talk about that.  Why don't you tell me about um, well first of all let me, there are some questions I need to ask you.

PATIENT X450
Sure, sure.

DOCTOR X450
Just to get to know you a little better.

PATIENT X450
Yeah did you need me to bring my uh.

DOCTOR X450
So I'll be your primary care, I'm looking at graduating in June so as long as @@@.

PATIENT X450
That's okay because I haven't really seen a doctor as far as a primary care physician in about 18 years.

DOCTOR X450
So let's get you established here and then DOCTOR will be your, he's going to be my supervisor and he'll be there.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
And he expects to be here.  Tell me about your past medical history, what else do you have?

PATIENT X450
Uh allergic to penicillin.  Um I had bronchiolitis as an infant.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
I had my appendix taken out uh.

DOCTOR X450
How long ago?  How long?

PATIENT X450
It would've been 99.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
98, right around there but I forget the month.  Um I've had maybe two bouts of kidney stones.  I know the first one they did the fluids and then it suddenly went away and that kind of helped a little bit but the second time I had to have the surgery.

DOCTOR X450
Oh okay.  Where they like they busted it up or did they have to go in?

PATIENT X450
No they had to go in.

DOCTOR X450
Alright.  

PATIENT X450
Um I've got two bulging disks in my back, L4-L5 and this was from about 1987-88.

DOCTOR X450
Did they do anything?

PATIENT X450
The doctor didn't want to do; the doctor I was seeing at the time did not want to do surgery.  He did not believe in surgery for any of that so he just basically gave me anti-inflammatories.

DOCTOR X450
And then uh.

PATIENT X450
I was out of work for like three months.

DOCTOR X450
Because of the low back pain?

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
So you had the kidney problems.  Any blood pressure?

PATIENT X450
The last time, no not the last time but as far back as I can remember it's been borderline.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
Uh I was told to watch your weight you could bring it down.  Uh from when I first come in with the stress test to when you took it today it's gone down quite a bit.

DOCTOR X450
Okay and your not on any medications right?

PATIENT X450
Correct.  

DOCTOR X450
Do you have anxiety?

PATIENT X450
Yeah.  Seems to @@@ for that.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
And another thing is the weight gain.  The last four months I've put on an average of about nine pounds a month.

DOCTOR X450
That.

PATIENT X450
I was going to talk to somebody today or I was gonna talk to you is I can get the note.  I want to go to the gym but if it's too taxing, if you could give me a little cheat pad or something with some water pills or uh a diuretic or something I mean.

DOCTOR X450
You know mostly @@@ and that might not be the appropriate thing to do.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  So let's uh, I'll kind of talk to you a little bit more about that.  Let's see so you're past medical, you said you had the borderline hypertension, you had L4-L5 disk, you've had the kidney stones, you had the appendectomy and um any kind of cholesterol problems, nothing like that?

PATIENT X450
No, no.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  @@@?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
And you told me @@@.  You've had any surgeries?

PATIENT X450
Surgeries I've only had those two.

DOCTOR X450
And then uh do you work now?

PATIENT X450
Yeah it's about 30 hours a week.

DOCTOR X450
What do you do?

PATIENT X450
I'm a driver for a bakery.

DOCTOR X450
And uh @@@, who do you live with?

PATIENT X450
Uh with my wife and children.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.

PATIENT X450
@@@.

DOCTOR X450
Three kids.

PATIENT X450
Three kids.  Three kids and @@@ grandchild to support.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.

PATIENT X450
Yeah.

DOCTOR X450
And do you smoke at all?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
Uh drink?

PATIENT X450
I'm an occasional drinker.  I'll drink, a drink at Christmas, a drink or two at New Year's and maybe you know at the family picnic I'll have a couple of beers.  It's not really.  If I do have drinks it's never more than two or three at a time.

DOCTOR X450
And you haven't done any drug use?

PATIENT X450
In the past yeah.

DOCTOR X450
Like what'd you use?

PATIENT X450
Uh marijuana was about 1982 that I stopped.  Um I did some amphetamines back then and I think I stopped in the 80s.  Uh I've done cocaine in the past.

DOCTOR X450
How long has that been?

PATIENT X450
Uh it's been a while.

DOCTOR X450
How often was that?

PATIENT X450
90s.

DOCTOR X450
And then @@@.

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
Any family history of illnesses or anything?

PATIENT X450
Well my mother passed away of lymphoma uh back in September but that was, she was taking some medicine uh Humira and one of the side effects was that it could cause lymphoma.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
So when they found out she was already in the late stage for it.  Uh my dad passed away um in 2001 um, oh it's the one where it attacks your bones um I can't think of the name, it's weird.  It @@@ bones um I forget the name of it now.  

DOCTOR X450
@@@?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.

PATIENT X450
Uh I can't remember the name but it was something that again that.

DOCTOR X450
@@@ was it a cancer or something?

PATIENT X450
Yeah it was a type of cancer, he was taking chemo and stuff like that and I don't remember the name now but uh it's never been in our family history.  We believe he contracted that at work.  He was working with shrink wrap, when they do shrink wrap and uh there was no ventilation in the.

DOCTOR X450
How old was he?

PATIENT X450
74.

DOCTOR X450
And it wasn't @@@.

PATIENT X450
No.  Basically he had a stroke but it was all, all uh.

DOCTOR X450
Any um any heart disease in the family?

PATIENT X450
Uh on my mother's side longevity, I mean there's a lot of longevity.  I mean I've got an aunt now who is in her 90s.  My grandmother died at 108.  Um now @@@.

DOCTOR X450
No diabetes?

PATIENT X450
No uh well, I got a cousin that had it but you know I don't keep much in touch with him.  I think it's because of his weight, he's up there.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  And uh let's go back to the um, I need to ask, you were telling me how do you feel today actually?  Any concerns you want to bring up today or just kind of establish care and talk about these things.

PATIENT X450
Just wanted to establish care and the follow-up today.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  And your chest pain, why don't we talk about your chest pain.

PATIENT X450
I was getting the chest pain right here.

DOCTOR X450
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X450
And sometimes it will shoot into my armpit and sometimes it would shoot into my back.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
Um and you know for a couple of weeks before that I would, my hands would go numb right from the elbow to the fingertips.

DOCTOR X450
Oh is that right.

PATIENT X450
If I'm in a certain position, let's say I'm driving and my arm's this way it would do it and then I'd have to either lower my arm.

DOCTOR X450
If you lowered it, it would go away.

PATIENT X450
Yeah it would be fine or if I'd sit you know and I'd put my hand like this.

DOCTOR X450
Right.

PATIENT X450
Then it would go numb.  Uh.

DOCTOR X450
That was only for those two weeks?

PATIENT X450
Uh for about two weeks beforehand and then once I started having those pains it would still do it during those while I was having the chest pain but after that, excuse me I'm plugged up.

DOCTOR X450
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X450
I'm out of the medicines.

DOCTOR X450
So the chest pain only came on, was it like a sharp presentation?

PATIENT X450
No it wasn't sharp pain, sharp pain.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
Do you get any shortness of breath with it?

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
Any nausea or vomiting when you have it?

PATIENT X450
No vomiting uh I think once or twice I had a little bit of nausea, nothing major.

DOCTOR X450
Any dizziness?

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
Did it seem like your heart was racing or anything?

PATIENT X450
Uh, once or twice I felt it was pumping really hard and it almost felt like it was an irregular heartbeat or something.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
Uh but it didn't last long.  Uh I didn't, I was so freaked out about it when it happened that uh I really didn't focus on I mean my heartbeat or anything like that, I was more freaked out than anything.

DOCTOR X450
I gotcha.  And then @@@ or anything?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
And then how long would you say that chest pain is lasting?

PATIENT X450
Uh, within five minutes, sometimes half an hour.

DOCTOR X450
Five minutes to half an hour.

PATIENT X450
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X450
And uh @@@.

PATIENT X450
Uh I had pain for about a week uh sometimes it was; when I was alone it would be like one time a day otherwise it would be a bunch of them every day.

DOCTOR X450
So it varies.

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.  

PATIENT X450
Um I was having just a tinge uh yesterday, just like a little you know just kind of a little minor @@@ um but really right after the stress test I freaked.  Once or twice more I think I had them and that was it.

DOCTOR X450
After you just go out and walk around do you have any trouble breathing at all?

PATIENT X450
No um.  Right after, right after when I started walking when the weather was so good.

DOCTOR X450
Right.

PATIENT X450
Before it got cold, I was trying to walk about a mile and a half, two miles a day.  Um for the first two days I'd walk about a mile, mile and a half and I was kind like out of breath and hurting but at the end of the week I was walking two miles um at a good pace with no problems.

DOCTOR X450
@@@ all about your conditioning.

PATIENT X450
Yeah.

DOCTOR X450
Did you get that chest pain after you walked?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  And then @@@ and fevers or chills right now?

PATIENT X450
No, not right now.

DOCTOR X450
And uh any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
And any abdominal pain?

PATIENT X450
Yes I get it but I think it's a byproduct of the medicine I'm taking.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
The uh antibiotics cause diarrhea.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  So you're @@@.  What color is it?

PATIENT X450
What color is what?

DOCTOR X450
@@@.  Does it have @@@ odor to it?  @@@.

PATIENT X450
Uh it's different than usual yeah.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  That started on the same day or?

PATIENT X450
Yeah pretty much or half a day after, 10 hours after or a couple hours after.

DOCTOR X450
Clindamycin can cause that as a side effect.  That can also cause like a bacterial super infection.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
So that's something to watch out for.  This sounds more like the diarrhea is a side effect from the antibiotic and not the other one.

PATIENT X450
Hmm.

DOCTOR X450
@@@ you're having a lot of this diarrhea, you find you get fevers and chills I think you should come @@@.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
And then uh the stuffy or runny nose.

PATIENT X450
It's not uh, it's never been runny, it's just stuffy uh but it's been a lot better.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.  Any dizziness?

PATIENT X450
Um no not really.

DOCTOR X450
And then any chest pain right now?

PATIENT X450
Not right now.  I had a little bit last night.

DOCTOR X450
It was the same thing that you were talking about?

PATIENT X450
Yeah but not as strong and it didn't last as long and that's basically this time I felt it and a couple of days but before it was happening every day.

DOCTOR X450
Any swelling or redness of your legs?

PATIENT X450
Um it's hard to tell with all this weight gain.  I mean I'm gaining weight so fast uh no @@@.

DOCTOR X450
And when you've been gaining weight over how long?

PATIENT X450
Um from October to now I've put on about 40 pounds.

DOCTOR X450
Why do you think that is?

PATIENT X450
I don't know uh well I mean I've been at the job doing what I'm doing now since March.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
Uh and I don't know what it is from uh October to now I don't know why all of a sudden a big weight gain.  I was pretty much steady.  I've always been between 205 and 220, pretty much my entire adult life.

DOCTOR X450
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X450
Ever since I got out of the military uh and it's just ballooned.  I'm not eating as much.  I only eat basically two meals a day um but I mean it gets winter and I'm not getting out and doing as much but.

DOCTOR X450
Any swollen @@@ coughing or cold.

PATIENT X450
I'm usually the other way around.  Usually I always drive with the windows @@@ open.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  Any problems with numbness?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
Any problems breathing?

PATIENT X450
Uh, right since I've been here yeah, I'm getting a little more stuffy but I've been really, really good since.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.  You're not wheezing or anything like that?

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.

PATIENT X450
Yeah.

DOCTOR X450
Well let's see, let me see what lab tests I'm gonna need.  Your blood work looks pretty good. @@@.  Yeah I think we need to check your cholesterol and that's up there pretty high.  It's high but for someone with no risk factors we definitely @@@.  So we might want to try to get that down with the T waves @@@ start with that and see if it helps okay.  We'll have to talk a little more about that, what we may want to do is check a couple more labs.

PATIENT X450
And I wanted to ask when I came in this time with the headaches.

DOCTOR X450
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X450
The sinus infection my wife suggested I ask the doctor @@@ cause when I come in for any type of blood work I do have them checked.

DOCTOR X450
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X450
@@@.

DOCTOR X450
Is that hepatitis B?

PATIENT X450
She has C and was infected too.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  Uh, yeah we don't have any C here, the tests are hepatitis B and that one you don't have.  But if you want we can @@@, you want the test?  @@@.  The one thing to worry about with weight gain sometimes is your thyroid.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
So this is the area we tested.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
And see if everything is normal.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
Let me have you sit up here and I'll listen to your chest.

PATIENT X450
You want the shirt off?

DOCTOR X450
I'll have you pull it up if that's okay.  @@@.  Say ah.

PATIENT X450
Ah.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.

PATIENT X450
Yes.

DOCTOR X450
Take a deep breath for me.  @@@.  Push against me now, good.  Can you look up for me, lean back good?  Now can you @@@.  @@@.  Close your eyes @@@.  Good.  @@@.  You still getting that numbness and tingling in here?

PATIENT X450
Uh-huh, @@@.

DOCTOR X450
@@@.  

PATIENT X450
No.

DOCTOR X450
Okay @@@.  Can you do this for me?  Any problems?  @@@.  Any problem with this?

PATIENT X450
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  Let me go talk to my supervisor @@@ and uh we just need to @@@ okay.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
Now one thing I should tell you about is the MOVE Program and we'll probably recommend that anyway, that's obviously what we do.  That's kind of the local gym here and we help you out with @@@.

PATIENT X450
Well I was looking at joining a gym.  I mean I'm really uh, I've been really, really, really worried about my weight.

DOCTOR X450
Yeah.

PATIENT X450
Um and I was even looking to you know like find a gym.  I think there's one on a T-shirt close to my house.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.

PATIENT X450
Um I really, I've been trying to talk my daughter into and I think she's finally agreed to join with me but if I could do that here @@@.

DOCTOR X450
Okay.  I'll see if that helps you out.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
I'll be right back.

PATIENT X450
Uh-huh.  Uh one other question um now this is probably due to age but within the last year my eyes have really been getting bad.  I was wondering if I could @@@.

DOCTOR X450
I could put in for an eye appointment okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:45  DOCTOR IN:  73:12)

DOCTOR X450
Alright.  So we were talking about it.  I think what we'll do is the you know some of the things that we talked about causing the weight gain.

PATIENT X450
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X450
Things to worry about would be the thyroid or adrenal problems.  Uh @@@ some sort of @@@ for labs for @@@ and then your thyroid function studies @@@.  What I think you could do is uh like I said we can try that MOVE Program.  @@@ weight gain @@@.  That would be more @@@ okay.  So we'll do that.  We'll send you to the MOVE Program and then we'll see you start losing weight and we'll have you come back and we'll check it @@@ every week, make sure you're checking your weight and then we'll have you come back in a month to see if there's any change at all okay.

PATIENT X450
Okay.

DOCTOR X450
I also want to check @@@ so that's why we'll have you come back.  

PATIENT X450
@@@.

DOCTOR X450
Yeah so the MOVE Program, the nice thing about it is it's not just a gym but you'll have someone that works with you there to recommend exercises and @@@ just before we do that I do also want to get some stool studies from you.  That diarrhea that you're telling me, even though it just started and it could be directly from the antibiotic but @@@.

PATIENT X450
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X450
Just make sure that's all it is cause @@@ antibiotics.  Okay.

PATIENT X450
Do you just want to know the color or I mean.

DOCTOR X450
No, no, they check it for that testing.  Okay.  @@@.  But if it is positive then we'll work out something different.  Is this the right number to call you at, NUMBER.

PATIENT X450
No I changed it.  NUMBER.

DOCTOR X450

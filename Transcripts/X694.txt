SECOND PERSON X694
A hair less.

DOCTOR X694
When was the last time though?

SECOND PERSON X694
Uh see if I can find it.  Well, on a few occasions they were low but I really can't say.  When we were moving around you know it's really not that bad.

DOCTOR X694
So he doesn't really have low episodes normally?

DOCTOR X694
Okay.  Um okay and when was the last time you saw the oncologist?  They look at your lung cancer.

SECOND PERSON X694
Been about six or eight months.

DOCTOR X694
Are you due to see them soon?

PATIENT X694
Uh not right away, I think it was rescheduled.

SECOND PERSON X694
@@@.

PATIENT X694
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X694
There were more reasons that we rescheduled it, that's all.

DOCTOR X694
Okay and you were supposed to, in June, I think it was June when you saw them?

PATIENT X694
Last uh.

DOCTOR X694
Well I see one from January that they wanted to see you in June.  When was the last CT scan of his chest?

SECOND PERSON X694
Probably uh, it should be uh prior to that to the oncology examination.  

DOCTOR X694
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X694
See what happened is he came from Florida.

DOCTOR X694
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X694
From a nursing home and uh they uh he didn't bring any records with him and so they asked me to go and see if I could happen to @@@ because they wanted to uh, some information about what really happened.

DOCTOR X694
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X694
With that and so it took me a while to get that information and when I found that, I got the information for the actual treatment that he took for his lung cancer.

DOCTOR X694
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X694
And but I think @@@, well everything's fine, they think that he doesn't, you know no @@@ or follow-up and then the CT @@@.

DOCTOR X694
Okay and you don't feel like your heart is racing right now or anything like that?

PATIENT X694
No.

DOCTOR X694
Okay and you took your blood pressure medicine this morning?

PATIENT X694
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X694
Uh let me, if I may, uh we are doing @@@.

DOCTOR X694
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X694
He just started that uh two weeks ago.

DOCTOR X694
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X694
That might be the reason why his blood pressure is dropping because he's been on this medication @@@ for a while but we just recently started this exercise.

DOCTOR X694
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X694
So that might be suppressing his blood pressure because he's just never been on exercise before.

DOCTOR X694
Okay.  Yeah I mean it is low.

SECOND PERSON X694
Yeah.

DOCTOR X694
But the fact that he's not having any symptoms kind of makes me less worried.

SECOND PERSON X694
Yeah.

DOCTOR X694
Cause your blood pressure can drop for many reasons but if you're not having symptoms from it you know, if you're having infection, you're not drinking enough fluids, you're eating and drinking okay.

PATIENT X694
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X694
And you're making good urine and still urinating @@@.

PATIENT X694
Yeah.

DOCTOR X694
I'm not getting worried about that okay.  But I'm gonna take a quick listen to your heart and lungs.  And I understand you see the neurologist and they do injections is that right?

PATIENT X694
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X694
You had one.

SECOND PERSON X694
@@@ shot.

DOCTOR X694
Yeah and where did they do it?

SECOND PERSON X694
Well they've done, they've done it from his arm and they got it from his on the @@@ left side, the arm and the middle lower leg.

DOCTOR X694
On the left side.

SECOND PERSON X694
Right, the right side I'm sorry.
DOCTOR X694
Right, on both sides.

SECOND PERSON X694
Right.

DOCTOR X694
And then you had the tremor in your left hand.

PATIENT X694
Uh uh yes, yes.

DOCTOR X694
Okay, okay.  I'm gonna listen to your heart.  I'm gonna lift up your um.

PATIENT X694
@@@?

DOCTOR X694
Uh-huh.  Okay.  Take a deep breath.  One more time.  One more time.  Once more.  You can breathe normally now.  No belly pain or anything?

PATIENT X694
No.

DOCTOR X694
No pain with urination?  Can you open your mouth?  @@@.  Okay.  Are you able to move this arm at all?  Okay and then what about this arm can you move it straight up, push it up, don't let me push it down good.  Are you able to lift this leg up?  Is that an improvement from before?  Okay and what about this one?  @@@ This one again, okay good.  Okay let me grab the blood pressure machine okay.  @@@ sit up here, are you able to do that?

SECOND PERSON X694

DOCTOR X694
Sorry I'll just be quick and then I can get you back in a chair okay.

PATIENT X694

DOCTOR X694
Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're just gonna stop the blood pressure medication now okay.

SECOND PERSON X694
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X694
And do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?

SECOND PERSON X694

SECOND PERSON X694
Right.

DOCTOR X694
And obviously if he has any symptoms from it or if you feel lightheaded or you feel like you're gonna pass out or you start having diarrhea, anything to make us think that you're losing volume, then we'd be worried and we'd want you to come into the ER okay.  But right now you're not having any symptoms right?

SECOND PERSON X694
Okay.

DOCTOR X694
So um.

SECOND PERSON X694
We can get that done before we leave here.

DOCTOR X694
If it stays around 100 that's fine but if it starts going up above 120 then we want to restart it okay.

SECOND PERSON X694
Okay.

DOCTOR X694

SECOND PERSON X694

PATIENT X536
Uh @@@ do I have any pain medications?

I'm just concerned.  I don't want to give you the Vicodin again because you came in last time and you took kind of an overdose on Vicodin you know.  You ended up in the ICU and like that concerns me.  I'm going to @@@ you see the Pain Clinic right?

PATIENT X536
Uh no because I'm just going up there uh pain, I go to pain therapy and that's for the next one is the end of the next week, next Thursday. 

DOCTOR X536
And we can try starting lower again.  We could try some ibuprofen and stuff like that to start with.  I mean this is saying you still have some Vicodin left.  But I don't want you to take it, I mean the ones you've got left I don't want you taking more than one every eight hours you know.  Let me go talk with DOCTOR and see what she things about this.

PATIENT X536

DOCTOR X536
Oh you got to talk to me, what do you need to talk to me about?

PATIENT X536
Okay, they gonna put me on for my ride and I need my ride.

DOCTOR X536
Oh that you've got to talk to the transportation people.  Why did they say that can't give you a ride?

PATIENT X536
Because they said they want uh, I'm going for @@@ and then they want to give me what @@@ to catch the bus.

DOCTOR X536
Okay.

PATIENT X536
And them buses, I just can't get on a bus.

DOCTOR X536
Well you've got to the eligibility, talk to the transportation people @@@.

PATIENT X536
They told me uh, I talked to the social worker and she wasn't till the end of the month.

DOCTOR X536
And then what did they say.

PATIENT X536
And then I get paid for uh what is it?

DOCTOR X536
You're approved for VA travel until then, so you've got to follow up with them and see what you need to do to get re-approved for VA travel.

PATIENT X536
They said I have to talk to one of the doctors.

DOCTOR X536
Well I don't what they need.  Like I said you'll have to see them and have them bring back, have them let us know what you need.  Let me ask DOCTOR, @@@, what I need to do but I don't know if there's anything we can do without them telling us what you need so.

PATIENT X536
Okay.

DOCTOR X536
Okay, let me go talk to him and I'll be back.

PATIENT X536
Okay.

DOCTOR X536
Let me have you do one more thing.  Can I have you put your hat down, I want to have you stand up and walk over to me.

PATIENT X536
Put my hat down?

DOCTOR X536
Just put it up on the desk.

PATIENT X536
Now what do you mean.

DOCTOR X536
I'll have you walk over this way towards me, go ahead and walk, careful.  Okay now turn around.  Can you do this, @@@ can you do this, one foot in front of the other?  I'll catch you if you fall.  Okay that's fine, that's fine, just have a seat.  Okay, I'll come back here and have a drink.

PATIENT X536
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:30  DOCTOR IN:  50:29)

DOCTOR X536
Alright, sorry for the wait.  Alright, we talked it over um we're thinking the weakness and the unsteadiness, it's kind of like you've got multiple things that are contributing to it okay.  So you have this history of this B12 deficiency in the past.

PATIENT X536
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X536
That can sometimes leave some lingering like permanent affects which makes like your legs unsteady.  Cause you have sensor, you have like sensors in your leg that tell you where you're moving everything and if those aren't working well that can contribute to being unsteady.  You've got the stroke and you had the craniotomy you know, which both attribute to just generalized the brain not working quite as well @@@ and in this case it's just @@@ walking.  So we're making um, how do you feel about getting, trying to get set up with one of those like scooters?  A three-wheel scooter, the motorized carts?  Do you want to try one of those or no?  I mean if you don't want it we won't do it.

PATIENT X536
I haven't got no way to get around in my house with it.

DOCTOR X536
Well yeah that's uh I mean, the other thing is I'd like to try to get you a walker just to use at home too.  Cause I think the cane, I'd prefer you had something where you get two hands on it, to keep you a little more steady.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT X536
Yeah.

DOCTOR X536
So I'd like to have you set up with that today.  You can go upstairs at Prosthetics and they could probably set you up with that today.  The scooter you'll have to come in to be evaluated for if you think you're interested in that.  Are you?

PATIENT X536
Yeah I believe, I'm interested in that thing but like I say I don't know whether I can use it, I got very limited space in the house and everything.

DOCTOR X536
Okay.  Well I mean, do you want to think about it cause I'm gonna have you come back in a month anyways.  I want to see how you're doing in a month.  Do you want to think about it and talk about it when you come back?

PATIENT X536
Okay.

DOCTOR X536
Okay well we'll do that then.  Let me put in the order but this one you take with you today.  You need to follow up in four weeks with me okay.

PATIENT X536
Okay.

DOCTOR X536
I'm going to put in the order for the walker so I want to have you go up to Prosthetics on the fourth floor and they'll, they could probably set you up with a walker so today.  But everything else you know I just saw you a little while ago so everything else looks like it's doing alright so we'll go with that but I want to see you again in a month cause I want to make sure you're doing okay and I don't want you come back and get admitted for anything okay.  I will renew the Vicodin for you for pain but we can't go back to the morphine or anything okay.  Um and the other thing, the next time you're here, I think you're gonna be here on the 12th again, bring your uh CPAP mask.  You bring the mask and bring @@@ they should be able to make sure it's fitting okay cause I think if the mask is fitting better it'll help you sleep too and the sleep will help kind of get rid of at least some of this so.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT X536
Yeah.

DOCTOR X536
Okay.  Do you have any questions for me right now?

PATIENT X536
Oh let's see I can't think of anything @@@ so you want me to go up to the.

DOCTOR X536
Fourth floor.

PATIENT X536
Fourth floor.  And you want me to get set-up for a walker.

DOCTOR X536
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X536
Then.

DOCTOR X536
And I'll make sure all your meds are refilled and everything too so.

PATIENT X536
Okay they can be mailed.

DOCTOR X536
Yeah, yeah.  You get everything mailed to you generally right.

PATIENT X536
Yeah.

DOCTOR X536
Yeah I'll make sure everything's still going to get mailed to you then so.

PATIENT X536
Okay.

DOCTOR X536
Okay.

PATIENT X536
Okay.

DOCTOR X536
Alright I'm gonna see you back soon okay so if you have any problems come back to Urgent Care and everything but I'll see you back in four weeks.

PATIENT X536
Okay.

DOCTOR X536
That's it.

PATIENT X536

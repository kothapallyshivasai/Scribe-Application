DOCTOR X464
PATIENT?  Have a seat.

PATIENT X464
Okay.

DOCTOR X464
How you doing?

PATIENT X464
@@@.

DOCTOR X464
So um, any problems today?

PATIENT X464
Yeah.  Uh the one thing I was running late and ran out of the office, I forgot my what's that thing, that meter, glucose meter.

DOCTOR X464
Okay.  So you don't have your log with you?

PATIENT X464
Hmm?

DOCTOR X464
Did you bring a log of your blood sugars?

PATIENT X464
No I didn't bring the log cause I had too many stops.  There's a lot of things that's happened since the last time, that's what I'm saying uh, @@@ exam and that threw me off.  I was thinking of tracking everything but as far as taking you know @@@ that was that until uh then I had another personal problem.

DOCTOR X464
What kind of personal problems?

PATIENT X464
Uh so but I think, I can tell you what the uh, what the numbers are.

DOCTOR X464
Okay.

PATIENT X464
They been running in the high twos and low threes.

DOCTOR X464
Okay.

PATIENT X464
Now go ahead, I'll ask you these questions at the end.

DOCTOR X464
No you ask me your questions first.

PATIENT X464
Um it's about the medication.  Now I been on this medication for a while and it doesn't seem to be bringing the numbers down.

DOCTOR X464
The insulin?

PATIENT X464
Yeah.

DOCTOR X464
You're not on a very high dose and you're not going up on it that fast because you, the last time you were here we were trying to get you to at least in the low 100s okay and that would be good but your A1c, your three months blood sugars is not showing that and so that's why I sent you over to the diabetes pharmacist so that you could go up on the insulin to get your sugars controlled okay.

PATIENT X464
What?

DOCTOR X464
Um I saw that you missed a couple of appointments with them uh.

PATIENT X464
Well.

DOCTOR X464
They wanted to see you at the end of December.

PATIENT X464
Right.

DOCTOR X464
It sounds like you had some personal.

PATIENT X464
Yeah but that's not, that day something, either the weather and I called and worked the system asking me do you want to cancel or do you want to reschedule and I told it I want to reschedule.  They said we'll be sending you out this information.

DOCTOR X464
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X464
They never sent it out.  The only way I got it is that I redid it myself.  Your appointment and their appointment so I don't know why.

DOCTOR X464
When do you go see them next?

PATIENT X464
What's that?

DOCTOR X464
Today at what time?

PATIENT X464
After you.

DOCTOR X464
Okay.

PATIENT X464
They said I had two appointments.

DOCTOR X464
Okay.  Yeah.  And you had a little bit of wait for us so you'll have a hard time getting to the other one on time.  Um.

PATIENT X464
Well.

DOCTOR X464
You know, do you need to.  How much insulin are you taking right now?

PATIENT X464
30.

DOCTOR X464
30 okay.  They had asked you to go up on it by um 2 units every four days because it is still high.  Have you been doing that?

PATIENT X464
Well they told me that.

DOCTOR X464
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X464
2 units every four days.

DOCTOR X464
Yeah until your sugars come down to the 100s in the morning.  But that, you know that takes a lot of checking on your part so if you don't, if you have other things going on and you're not checking your sugars, you know you definitely have a lot work to do on your diabetes.  Okay.  And I understand that sometimes personal problems, you know things going on in your personal life that may affect it but you know we definitely have a lot of work to do.  Um going up on the insulin, I mean we may have you come up to giving insulin twice a day or adding um an insulin that you take with meals but.

PATIENT X464
With what?

DOCTOR X464
With meals.

PATIENT X464
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X464
Another shot with each meal that you eat.  Um but that takes a lot of work on your part as well.  I mean you are writing everything down and putting it in a log so you know what to do um.

PATIENT X464
Right.  Any guess on how many doctors ever go here to the VA, I probably @@@.

DOCTOR X464
Um I'm gonna let the diabetes pharmacist change your insulin okay.  

PATIENT X464
Change it to the 2.

DOCTOR X464
Well uh yeah.  I'll let them talk to you about what to, this has also been like all day long um and so you know you should be going to see her every month until we get this under better control okay.

PATIENT X464
Okay.

DOCTOR X464
Um so I'm not going to change anything but I can tell you, when you see her I'll let her do that when you see her after we're done okay.

PATIENT X464
Alright.

DOCTOR X464
Um.

PATIENT X464
Now okay go ahead you go first.

DOCTOR X464
What else do you need to talk to me about?

PATIENT X464

PATIENT X464

DOCTOR X464

PATIENT X464
Okay.

DOCTOR X464
Um so let me, I'm going to increase the hydralazine okay.

PATIENT X464
That's the orange pill.

DOCTOR X464

DOCTOR X464
Okay.  Do you still want the Tylenol?

PATIENT X464

DOCTOR X464

PATIENT X464
Yeah nobody told me with diabetes you don't want it over 130.

DOCTOR X464
And they want it under 120.

PATIENT X464
120?

DOCTOR X464
Yeah.

PATIENT X464
I never heard that.

DOCTOR X464
So we'll just increase the hydralazine.

PATIENT X464

PATIENT X464
I don't have, I took the last one this morning.

DOCTOR X464

PATIENT X464
Okay let me ask you something now, all the rest of the pills I get 90 days worth cause I always take them once a day.  I get 90 days.

DOCTOR X464
Do you want 90 days of the hydralazine?

PATIENT X464
Yeah cause I always run out of that.

DOCTOR X464
Oh.

PATIENT X464
Because I'm taking it three times a day.

DOCTOR X464
You take the, so I have a 90 days supply put in.  So they'll give you a 90 day supply today on that.

PATIENT X464
Okay and these are going to be increased dosage?

PATIENT X464
So when I go home and take my second one I'll just take one of these.

DOCTOR X464

PATIENT X464
And then one tonight.

DOCTOR X464
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X464
Okay.

DOCTOR X464
Alright.  Um let's see what else, any problems with shortness of breath?  Okay.  No chest pain or anything like that?

PATIENT X464
Nope.  In fact, well I shouldn't say this but I think it must not be right.  I used to have problems with my legs as far as them swelling.

DOCTOR X464
Is that better?

PATIENT X464
It hasn't done that in a long time.

DOCTOR X464
Well that's good.

PATIENT X464
And @@@.

DOCTOR X464
So that means the medicines are doing their jobs.

PATIENT X464
Huh?

DOCTOR X464
The medicines are doing their jobs.

PATIENT X464
Yeah because, like it would be like right here.

DOCTOR X464
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X464
It would be out here.

DOCTOR X464
Yeah.

PATIENT X464
You know what I mean and then there's nothing in the ankles.

DOCTOR X464
Yeah.  Um let's see last time in December we checked your cholesterol.  Your cholesterol is not quite where we need it to be.

PATIENT X464
It was under 200 the last time I took it, what is it?

DOCTOR X464
So your total cholesterol was 300 in December okay.  The bad cholesterol is 119 and when you have diabetes we want it under 70 okay.  Um and given your history of heart problems in the past okay.  So you're on, let's see, you're on the um simvastatin 80 mg.

PATIENT X464
I take them once every night.

DOCTOR X464
Let's see.

PATIENT X464
There's three pills I take at night, that one, the prostate medicine and the uh orange pill.

DOCTOR X464
Let's see.  Well I'll have to see what, you're on the highest dosage that we have here so I'll have to talk to DOCTOR about you know if we can get you a different medicine uh or what we can do.  Uh but you're cholesterol needs to come down so okay.

PATIENT X464
I brought it down cause the last time I.

DOCTOR X464
It was down back a year ago but when we tested it in December it was back up.

PATIENT X464
Well I'm taking @@@.

DOCTOR X464
And we checked it today and it's not back yet.  The thing is if that comes back, the blood that you had done this morning, it looks like your kidney function is not doing the best.  Have you ever seen the kidney doctors?

PATIENT X464
No.

DOCTOR X464
Okay.  Um you're seeing the urologist right for your um, for your cancer of the prostate right?

PATIENT X464
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X464
No problems there?

PATIENT X464
Uh uh.  I got an appointment with him in a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR X464
Okay it's likely the worsened kidney function is from your diabetes okay and the high blood pressure.  Your blood pressure has been uncontrolled you know in the past you probably you've had it @@@ but right now it's okay.  Um so it's just another reason to get the diabetes under control okay.  Um and yeah.

PATIENT X464
They gonna do a PSA on that?

DOCTOR X464
PSA did they check that today as well?  Um, the last time we checked it was in September and it was low, it was 0.03 so very well, that's good, no problems there.  Um so you know really getting the diabetes under control, all I'm gonna do for you today is to increase the blood pressure medicine and see if we can change the cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT X464
Okay.

DOCTOR X464
And anything else you want to talk to me about?

PATIENT X464
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X464
Okay.  Come have a seat up here.  And you said no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no belly problems, problems urinating?

PATIENT X464
@@@.

DOCTOR X464
Your going more often?

PATIENT X464
No more than before.

DOCTOR X464
That's partly because of your sugars.  Your sugar @@@ in your urine and you know all this stuff with your sugar is tied.

PATIENT X464
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X464
It happens when the blood sugar is high.  You know, when you have @@@ go more often so.  Hopefully we can get your sugars down and we can make that better too.

PATIENT X464

DOCTOR X464

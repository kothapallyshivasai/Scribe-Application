DOCTOR X140
But if they just kind of get a letter we just set up a time.

PATIENT X140
Hmm, probably cause that they did they sent me a letter like a week before.  They send me a letter saying that I missed the appointment and I never had the appointment.

DOCTOR X140

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Uh you know what, I could use a little more.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
It's not really as much but just a little bit.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
So I don't have to call in.  It kind of comes with taking a couple @@@.  

DOCTOR X140
Um, you still I guess, are you feeling at all, are you having like nightmares or things like that are intrusive or?

PATIENT X140
Sometimes, sometimes you know.  Yeah I fell asleep, just about two days ago, I fell asleep with the TV on and I don't know why, but you know I could, it seemed like I was having a bad dream and I woke up and you know I had tears in my eyes and what I was dreaming what was on the TV.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
And it was like and it was what happened with a Mel Gibson movie.  We Were Soldiers that was playing and then it was like sad and I just shut it off and insomnia, you know I stayed up for a while and then I went to sleep.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
But it was hard.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  Um and you're not thinking at all of like harming yourself or any others.

PATIENT X140
No, no, no.

DOCTOR X140
Would you say that the PTSD is uh not controlled, somewhat controlled or well controlled?

PATIENT X140
Well, it's, how would I say, it's controlled I guess.  But then again there's days where you know you just, whenever you see something or you know, something happened and it just clicks and something clicks and you know you just, you maybe not at home and it just happens and stuff that happened so I just have to deal with it and you know, just deal with it.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
And uh try to get home.  I'm fine in my home you know, @@@ I'm at home but sometimes, I don't know some other guys carry around and sometimes it's okay and then I know when I got to leave and then I just go.

DOCTOR X140
So this is my card.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
The number on the back there is the number for the Mental Health Center if you were ever to need anything quickly.

PATIENT X140
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X140
Um so what you do is you call into the normal VA number like you know the Vets Number.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
I think its 1-800.

PATIENT X140
I have the card at home; I think I have it at home so.

DOCTOR X140
So if you dialed that, they may ask you for an extension, you can dial that extension.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Let me uh, I got to take this for a second.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
(Doctor answers a page).  Okay so I'll put that in and they'll contact you about scheduling that appointment.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Did you eat anything today?

PATIENT X140
Um.

DOCTOR X140
If you ate.

PATIENT X140
Just coffee today you know.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
I just had my coffee this morning, that's it.

DOCTOR X140
Whenever we ask you to get a cholesterol panel, we need you to be 14 hours fasting.

PATIENT X140
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X140
I think I'll go ahead and order a cholesterol panel for you.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
And um next time you're at the VA for some reason, just get it drawn you know.

PATIENT X140
You mean a blood sample?

DOCTOR X140
Yeah a blood draw.

PATIENT X140
Oh go downstairs.

DOCTOR X140
You have to be fasting for 14 hours.  Which just means like after you finish dinner at night.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Don't eat anything else.

PATIENT X140
Don't eat anything else.

DOCTOR X140
And then you come in the morning, get your blood drawn and then you can eat breakfast.

PATIENT X140
Okay.  Uh I can do that next week sometime.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  That'd be great.  Just because you know.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Um once you hit like 40-50 I mean we like to start checking cholesterol and the urine and seeing whether or not we need to talk about diet changes or starting medication or something like that.

PATIENT X140
Alright.

DOCTOR X140
Uh blood pressure looks good and so I'll just restart the Lamisil and I'll have you follow up with the Mental Health people.

PATIENT X140
And for my blood pressure, hydro what are they?

DOCTOR X140
Yeah I'll reorder those.  And those are, you have refills of them.

PATIENT X140
Right so I just need to take a look at them, to tell you the truth actually.

DOCTOR X140
Okay well you have refills so.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
You can go downstairs to the Pharmacy and go tell them that you'd like your refills; you'd like to get refills.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Or you can call in.  It'd probably be best, you know if you're running out.

PATIENT X140
Can I just call them, this way if I come in next week, like say Tuesday or something like that I could pick them up?

DOCTOR X140
Well they mail them to your house.

PATIENT X140
Okay can I call and just pick them up because sometimes it takes a week, two weeks.

DOCTOR X140
I don't think you can call in and pick them up from here.

PATIENT X140
Oh no, oh okay.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
So I'll just have to call in and have them mail it.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah.  I'll see whether or not I can call down to the Pharmacy.  I've got to go talk to my attending.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
To see if I can call down to the Pharmacy and get that set up to be picked up before you leave.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Take a deep breath.  Okay.  Let me take a quick listen to your lungs.  Okay.  If I can just get you to lay back down.  @@@.  Okay, sit up.  I was reading one of the notes, you drink about 4-5 beers per day?

PATIENT X140
Yeah.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
@@@ but just about every day.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  Um and you know you can talk to the Mental Health people about that but I mean a little bit more alcohol than you know we like to be comfortable with.  You know that being said um, if you're drinking that much, you know I don't think that's to the level of alcoholism but it is to the level that is you know somewhat concerning and I guess my biggest concern is that you're on the Lamisil.  Lamisil can already cause problems with your liver.

PATIENT X140
Oh is that right?

DOCTOR X140
Yeah so um the alcohol would just kind of be more of increased risk of things that are causing problems there.

PATIENT X140
Oh.  Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
So I mean try to keep it on the, you know the lighter side.

PATIENT X140
Yeah alright.  Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Uh like I mean, just this is double @@@.

PATIENT X140
That's one of the reasons I go to the post you know.

DOCTOR X140
You're going to go where?

PATIENT X140
xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
A number of vets there and.

DOCTOR X140
And everyone drinks there.

PATIENT X140
Yeah you know.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Watching the games, things like that.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  Um, how often would you say you drink to the point of um like intoxication, being drunk?

PATIENT X140
Well, really it's not to intoxication it's for more like uh only when like holidays.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Not really even holidays.  Uh once in a while I mean there's nothing, I don't know how often.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Once in a while.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  I just wanted to make sure that you know with your diagnosis of PTSD.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
Um you're at a little bit higher risk for um getting into some stronger alcohol problems.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
Um so it's just a concern.

PATIENT X140
Yeah.

DOCTOR X140
I just want to make sure you're not like medicating yourself with alcohol for the PTSD.

PATIENT X140
No, no.  She won't let me.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  Your wife or?

PATIENT X140
No girlfriend yeah.

DOCTOR X140
Girlfriend okay, good.  It's like men live longer when they have wives or girlfriends.

PATIENT X140
She like.

DOCTOR X140
Women live shorter so I always tell my girlfriend that men suck the life out of women.

PATIENT X140
Oh man she just comes, whenever she feels like it.  She has her own place like kind of whenever she comes in, @@@ and like yeah I'm just keeping an eye on you and I said alright, I know.

DOCTOR X140
Um, I'll have to be right back.

PATIENT X140
Oh.

DOCTOR X140
I'm going to go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  74:55  DOCTOR IN:  79:47)

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  Can I take a look at your nails?  So this stuff is growing in here, is like new nail.

PATIENT X140

DOCTOR X140
That should eventually grow out.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
And the stuff that's all dystrophic like this.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
Will, you'll just eventually cut it off.

PATIENT X140

PATIENT X140
Oh I won't need it.

DOCTOR X140

PATIENT X140
Alright.

DOCTOR X140
If you do if it comes back we can treat it again.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Uh but let's just see cause like I said you know it's not a totally benign drug.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
It can cause liver problems.

PATIENT X140
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X140
It's just @@@.

PATIENT X140
Alright, okay, thanks.

DOCTOR X140
As far as the trazodone, how many pills are you taking per day?

PATIENT X140
Uh oh it depends you know.  Sometimes I have to take three of them.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Cause you now I.

DOCTOR X140
Three full pills or three half pills?

PATIENT X140
Three full pills.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.  You're only supposed to be taking one per day.

PATIENT X140
Once doesn't do anything.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
It doesn't and, it doesn't do anything sometimes.  I have to take like two of them sometimes.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
And then.

DOCTOR X140
It's as if they don't get you to the level where you're able to go to sleep?

PATIENT X140
No, I can't.  I still, I'll go to sleep, I mean I won't.  I don't want to go to sleep.

DOCTOR X140
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X140
And it's not like I can't go to sleep.  You know before I used to take it and just go to sleep.

DOCTOR X140
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X140
I guess I have to like make myself go to sleep and then I can't go to sleep.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Just I don't know, it's not working.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
That's why I just take two, three, whatever I need at the time is what I take.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR one more time.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
See what he wants to do about that.

(DOCTOR OUT:  81:30  DOCTOR IN:  83:18)

DOCTOR X140
So the maximum dose for those is 400 mg per day.

PATIENT X140
Per day.

DOCTOR X140
Per day.  I'll put in an order for you to get.

PATIENT X140
Cause I know uh, what was I using?  I used to take when I was in xxx xxx or even over there at West Side I was getting I think it was 200 mg per, I think it was 200 or 250, I'd take two pills.

DOCTOR X140
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X140
And they were I think like 100 a piece or something like that, I forgot what they were it's been a while.

DOCTOR X140
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X140
But that's what I was getting when I was started at West Side or now at xxx Brown but anyway um then with Great Lakes, xxx xxx there I was still taking those cause that's what they told me to take and I was taking them there.  That's it.

DOCTOR X140
So I think it’s okay for you to take two or three per day and I.

PATIENT X140
See I don't take it every day, every day.

DOCTOR X140
Okay.

PATIENT X140
Only when I really need it cause I know they're not habit-forming or anything but I just you know.

DOCTOR X140
And also I want you to stop napping during the day.

PATIENT X140
How'd you guess?

DOCTOR X140
Cause everyone your age naps during the day.  So that's a problem is you'll be napping during the day and then you get like half of your sleep in and then you try your hardest to get to sleep at night and it's frustrating and eventually you fall asleep and then three hours later you wake up again.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
And you wake up again because you slept three hours earlier in the day and so now you've gotten your six hours for the day so your body's like we're done sleeping and you're like it's only 3 in the morning I need to go back to sleep.

PATIENT X140
I know and that helps watching TV.

DOCTOR X140
Instead set a pot of coffee out for maybe a few days.

PATIENT X140
I do.

DOCTOR X140
And drink that during the day and keep yourself up but the main thing is staying active so, you know.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
For at least a while try to find somewhere to go and go take a walk.  I know it's hot out but you know or go to the store and go to like xxx xxx and walk around for a while.

PATIENT X140
@@@.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah and find you know something, a hobby to do.

PATIENT X140
What?

DOCTOR X140
Something to keep you awake during the day.

PATIENT X140
Really what I do.

DOCTOR X140
You get your schedule kind of flipped if you stop napping during the day and you stay awake at night, then that'll help.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
Also another problem that people have is that they drink a ton of coffee in the morning and they're wide awake and they're rearing to go and then 2 o'clock and crash.

PATIENT X140
Right.

DOCTOR X140
So what you got to do is drink less coffee in the morning and maybe have another little bit of coffee in the afternoon.

PATIENT X140
Okay.  They serve coffee at the Post.  A lot of times, we’ll see.

DOCTOR X140
You spend a lot of time at the Post.

PATIENT X140
Well you know what, I what I do there I uh I clean up.

DOCTOR X140
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X140
Keep me busy, keeps me doing something you know.

DOCTOR X140
Sure.

PATIENT X140
So I clean up, I load the beer.  NAME is there and there are two of us.

DOCTOR X140
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X140
And this is what we do every day.

DOCTOR X140
So yeah, it's.

PATIENT X140
Then I go home.

DOCTOR X140
And you fall asleep?

PATIENT X140
No, well yeah and then I go home and go to sleep.  You know I'm watching and I doze off and I don't even know what's going on you know I just wake up, I don't even know what time it is.  Holy shit I fell asleep for two hours and I don't believe this.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah.

PATIENT X140
And I might be sitting there watching TV and I don't know, I just fall asleep.  Girlfriend she's there watching TV, she's on the couch and I'm like on the loveseat there and watching TV and watching TV and then you know and she'll get up and sometimes she just nudges me, get up, get up, you're falling asleep again.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah, @@@ out of the way.  So if you feel yourself kind of falling asleep like that, you got to get yourself up and do something like.  You know sometimes I'll go with my girlfriend and go for a walk.  Just go for a walk around the block you know.  It doesn't need to be real long but like 15 minutes of moving around helps stimulate you know your body cause otherwise after dinner, as soon as I eat dinner or as soon as I eat lunch, I'll fall asleep.

PATIENT X140
Oh man I'm like that.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah everyone does that.  So you got to come up with some methods otherwise you're just going to be up all night too.

PATIENT X140
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X140
Alright you're all set.

PATIENT X140
Alright sounds good.

DOCTOR X140
I'll see you back in how long, when do you want to see me, a couple of months?

PATIENT X140
Yeah, whenever you think is good.

DOCTOR X140
Okay, let's do.

PATIENT X140
Do I need to take this any place?

DOCTOR X140
Yeah you take it up front.

PATIENT X140
Oh up front.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah so as far as the medications go, um you can't call in to our Pharmacy.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
And pick up medicine so.

PATIENT X140
So I have to call it in and wait till they send it.

DOCTOR X140
Exactly.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
Or you can go downstairs and try to grab it right now.  I would just check and see, maybe at 2 o'clock you know um, there may not be that many people waiting down there.

PATIENT X140
Just go down there.  I'll probably do that.

DOCTOR X140
I'd like you not to miss any of your blood pressure pills.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
I'd rather you take the whole.

PATIENT X140
Yeah I have like only, I think like four left.

DOCTOR X140
Yeah so you're going to have to pick up some downstairs.

PATIENT X140
Okay.

DOCTOR X140
So you can go up there @@@ and then go grab a cup of coffee downstairs @@@ and then come back and then pick them up.  Okay.  Take care okay.  Let me know if you have any problems.

PATIENT X140
Okay I sure will.

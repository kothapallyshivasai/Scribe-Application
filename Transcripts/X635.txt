DOCTOR X635
Do you want me to take your coat sir?  If the seat with the back is more comfortable you're welcome sit right here, otherwise @@@.

PATIENT X635
I'm gonna sit here.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah, no that's fine.  Alright let me just pull up your chart here.  The @@@ that was on before and we lost this computer so then of course now I've got to print off some of these charts, so I've been @@@ you today.  Okay.  Well let's just @@@.  How long have you been like that?

PATIENT X635
Well it's been hurting for a while you know.

DOCTOR X635
How long?

PATIENT X635
The doctor that's been coming out to see me, you know to see if I can on some pain pills, but she don't want to continue to just giving me pain pills.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
She wants me to you know get it checked out.  She wanted me to go to a pain doctor.

DOCTOR X635
Specialist?

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  Who is seeing you, is it a visiting doctor, at home?

PATIENT X635
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.  DOCTOR.

PATIENT X635
No she's a mobile, mobile uh.

DOCTOR X635
Mobile doctor?

PATIENT X635
Mobile uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
What was she giving you for the pain do you know?

PATIENT X635
Uh.

DOCTOR X635
Was it Vicodin?

PATIENT X635
Vicodin, Vicodin.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.  What's the reason?  Usually we like to give people Vicodin to try and get them over a hump.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
People who have chronic back pain like that.

PATIENT X635
Yes.

DOCTOR X635
You're always gonna be in some degree of pain but I'm sure as you know if it's bad.

PATIENT X635
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X635
If it's bad enough you'll get something done.

PATIENT X635
Yes.

DOCTOR X635
So some people have pain all the time?

PATIENT X635
Yes.

DOCTOR X635
Your body gets used to that.

PATIENT X635
Yeah well you know it helps you know but you know but she doesn't want to continue to give it to me cause she say that you know it would probably start affecting my liver and then you know it will be habit-forming too also.

DOCTOR X635
Right.

PATIENT X635
You know so she didn't want to continue to give it to me you know.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
So she wanted me to go to a pain doctor.

DOCTOR X635
Okay and really um, I'm not a pain doctor.  I'm a general internist, a @@@ fellow but I can get you to the pain doctor and I can try my best to get you on you know something else.

PATIENT X635
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X635
It might help cause I know they have more experience with seeing people.

PATIENT X635
Right.

DOCTOR X635
Um are you taking any other medications?

PATIENT X635
Uh no.  My high blood pressure, that's the only thing.

DOCTOR X635
Do you know what that's called?

PATIENT X635
Uh, I don't remember the name of it.

DOCTOR X635
Is this the first time you've been here, with us?

PATIENT X635
What?

DOCTOR X635
Is this the first time you've been here to the VA?

PATIENT X635
No, I was here um, I don't know about six weeks ago.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  I'll check to see if it's @@@ then I can look and we can see all your meds.

PATIENT X635
Right.

DOCTOR X635
And your vitals and how your blood pressure has been and all that kind of stuff.  Um you said it's in the hip as well?

PATIENT X635
Yeah they I mean it radiates.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
It's in my back and then it radiates down to my hip.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
And then it goes all the way down to my knees.

DOCTOR X635
Does it ever reach the back of the foot?

PATIENT X635
Pardon?

DOCTOR X635
Does it ever reach the back of the foot?

PATIENT X635
No uh uh.

DOCTOR X635
Okay, it stops at the knees.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Um any incontinence?  Are you losing your bowel or your bladder with this?

PATIENT X635
Am I?

DOCTOR X635
Losing your bowel or your bladder.  Are you being incontinent with this pain?  I know this sounds like a strange question but the same nerves that supply down the back of the leg also supply your bladder and your bowels.  So if people are having a lot of compression on that nerve for some reason or the other.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Sometimes they're not able to hold their bowels or bladder.  Has that been a problem for you?

PATIENT X635
No, no, no, no.

DOCTOR X635
Good.  Any tingling on the inner thighs at all or just pain down the back?

PATIENT X635
Uh it's just goes; it goes in the thighs and then the back of the knees.  If feels like its radiating.

DOCTOR X635
Oh yeah, I'm sure it does.  I mean it sounds to me just um like textbook sciatica.

PATIENT X635
I thought it was you know like, see at one time I was carrying my wallet in my back, in the back pocket you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
And uh somebody told me that that's probably what's, you know, what's causing the pain you know.

DOCTOR X635
Uh I don't know about that.

PATIENT X635
But I haven't been carrying a wallet back there for a while; I keep my wallet in the coat pocket.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah but you're probably still getting the pain huh?

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
Let me pull this up.  I'm sorry for the delay.  I'm gonna pull up @@@ and I'm gonna show you something um, cause has anybody ever done an MRI of the back or explain to you why you get the pain in the hip as well?  Has anybody ever talked to you about that aside from the wallet theory?

PATIENT X635
No they took x-rays you know.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
But uh.  They asked me if I had fallen or something.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
But I denied it.  

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
You know I don't remember myself falling.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  When did you first start having back trouble?

PATIENT X635
Uh.

DOCTOR X635
Even as a young man?

PATIENT X635
I'd say about, about two years.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
About two years ago and then I, I had a therapist come over and he used to give me uh exercise you know cause I have in all the years of walking being bent over like this you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
And uh he would give me exercise and then after the exercise it would do okay.

DOCTOR X635
Probably feel good.

PATIENT X635
Yeah it helped.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
You know but then after a while you know I got it going back again.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.  Let me call this nurse back if you could @@@.

PATIENT X635
Alright.

(Doctor makes a phone call)

DOCTOR X635
Man those people, so I'm most the doctors here we all work at either University of Illinois or xxx.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
You know.

PATIENT X635
@@@.

DOCTOR X635
And they keep us five that worked last night till about 10 p.m. and admitted 28 patients yesterday.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
So it's just gonna be, you know its one thing after another.

PATIENT X635
Yesterday they were telling me to go to the uh.

DOCTOR X635
Because you were a vet?

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh and uh I just happened to be passing here and I was you know @@@ a bit, I just asked if any of the pain clinics you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
Here you know and they told me yeah so this is where I stopped you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah, nothing wrong with that, especially if you're a veteran, use your benefits.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
They're all gonna be free.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
And you can also get your medication here, um you know right now we should definitely start because I'm sure it's gonna be, I mean depending on what your co-pay is and stuff.

PATIENT X635
Yes.

DOCTOR X635
It's usually a lot cheaper than getting it on the outside.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  Alright.  So what they did it looks like that they gave you some x-rays.  They x-rayed the back, spine and x-rayed the right hip and then the right femur, which is this bone here.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
And you actually had @@@ you saw DOCTOR, the one I was just telling the nurse to go page, who's covering for me over there.  Um.  So did you get x-rays the last time you were here?

PATIENT X635
No I didn't get the x-rays here.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
You know, the day the VA told me to go and get them I was hurting so bad.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
And she told me that I had trouble walking down here to Radiology and then going over there to the uh.

DOCTOR X635
Lab and all this stuff.

PATIENT X635
Lab and stuff you know and man I was hurting so bad that day I just kept on out the door you know.

DOCTOR X635
I understand, I understand.

PATIENT X635
I wanted to keep my appointment today you know I, yeah I wanted to go and got to keep my appointment.  I had lost my appointment slip.

DOCTOR X635
Hmm.

PATIENT X635
I didn't know what time I was supposed to you know be here.  I was here early this morning.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah I saw that, 10:44.

PATIENT X635
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
So let me take a listen and then I want to show you this picture.  Um so what the physical therapist was probably doing that helps is a lot of times strengthening those muscles are on the back groups helps you take some of the pressure off for the spine.  Your spine @@@ walk.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
And if you get trouble in that with the little nerves coming out.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
You kind of get pain like you're having.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
Um so the physical therapy is good because it strengthens all the muscles around that and keeps those vertebrae from @@@ and putting pressure on.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Um, let me see if I can take a listen to you.  Do you have heart problems?

PATIENT X635
Do I have what?

DOCTOR X635
Heart troubles?

PATIENT X635
Heart troubles?

DOCTOR X635
Have you ever had a heart attack or?

PATIENT X635
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  Mouth open, deep breath in and out.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Okay.  Can you show me with one hand where it hurts the most?  Right on the side there huh?

PATIENT X635
Right in here.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  Did you ever wear a brace when you were a kid?  Did they ever put you in a back brace when you were a child or anything like that?

PATIENT X635
No um.  I know, I have no idea when I was 5-year-olds I got @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
And I wore a cast.  I was in a cast from here all the way down to you know.

DOCTOR X635
Oh wow.

PATIENT X635
And both my legs so.

DOCTOR X635
Wow.

PATIENT X635
So.

DOCTOR X635
Cause on the exam your spine is a little crooked.  It almost looks like a little scoliosis but not only are you getting like this, you've got a little bit this way.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
And that's typical.  Scoliosis usually will have the spine going like this and in reality @@@.

PATIENT X635
Yeah okay.  It's a little bit different in there.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah I think having scoliosis and having an injury in the past.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Makes you more likely to have this so, scoot your butt back for me, I just want to check your reflexes here of your foot, alright.  And just relax.  Can you take your hands and go like this, perfect.  Okay.  So the pain is on the side.  I don't want you to have pain but I'm glad it's not on the bone.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Okay I'm gonna lay you back.  You can go real slow.  Just lay back.  Does that make the pain any better, any worse?  Can you relax for me @@@.

PATIENT X635
I get stiff but it doesn't make me feel pain or anything.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  So I'm gonna lift your lift your leg up here.  I want you to tell me if it causes you any pain and if so where alright.  We'll go real slow.  Tell me if it's hurting you.  Tell me when okay.  You alright?

PATIENT X635
Okay it's starting to hurt now.

DOCTOR X635
Where does it hurt?

PATIENT X635
Right there.

DOCTOR X635
Right there alright.  Okay the same here.  Does it cause any pain when I pick this one up?

PATIENT X635
Yeah this ones bad.

DOCTOR X635
It hurts you on that side huh.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Alright.  Let me sit you up here.  Alright.  Is there anything that seems to make the pain better or worse?

PATIENT X635
Pardon?

DOCTOR X635
Does anything seem to make the pain better or worse position wise?

PATIENT X635
A position?

DOCTOR X635
Yeah, like leaning forward, leaning back, anything like that?

PATIENT X635
Well sitting down you know helps the pain.  When I stand and when I walk, when I walk is when it really, you know it really hurt most.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
And that's when I have the most pain is when I walk.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
You know.  As long as I'm still.

DOCTOR X635
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X635
But when I cramp, you know like I be on the bus sometimes and like if the bus is crowded or something.

DOCTOR X635
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X635
And I have to scoot a certain way.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
Because then you know.

DOCTOR X635
It takes some of the pressure off huh.

PATIENT X635
Yes, you know.

DOCTOR X635
Alright, excuse me. (Doctor speaks to someone at the door)  Let me show you this picture.  So I think what's going on um, pretty classic for something we call sciatica.  I just put in three x-ray of the back.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
But I think I already know what I'm gonna find.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Probably gonna see.  Can you see right here, I know it's kind of, let's see if I can make this any bigger, okay so that's much better.  So what I, oh alright so your pain you were telling me is kind of like here.  We're looking at the back of this gentleman right.

PATIENT X635
Hmm.

DOCTOR X635
The pain is kind of right here. 

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
So but these T's and these L's came for are how medicine named the blocks that make up your lumbar spine.  What the picture is trying to show are all the nerves that come out in between those blocks.  The pictures of blocks here and a block there.  So from things like injuries like you got hit when you were five.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
One thing, scoliosis is another thing.  Those are two things that tend to give people arthritis in the back okay and what happens when they get the arthritis, the picture of these kind of two blocks here, there's a close-up picture and he and you live your life in your @@@ you just came out no problem and you have no pain.  So these nerves travel everywhere, some down your legs, up your arms wherever and ever nerve is responsible for a different part of the body okay.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
So the reason why I was asking you does your pain affect your knee, does the pain reach your feet at sometimes is to figure out exactly what nerve might be responsible for causing you this pain.  So as we age you get these little bony spurs here and these little bony spurs pinch those nerves.  So the fact that you're getting pain here and the pain goes all the way down to your knees but doesn't get past the leg.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Tells me your trouble is probably in the nerve L3-L4, actually probably most definitely in L3-L4.  So what I bet we're gonna find in your x-rays, we're gonna find some bony spurs compressing those nerves.  So what do we do to treat it is the big question.  There's a component of inflammation.  So you're always gonna have those spurs, you can't get rid of them, despite surgery, despite anything.  So we got to get in the place where we're treating your pain on a daily basis.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
And whenever you get these inflammations you get exacerbations you know you throw out your back or sit for too long whatever, you're gonna have these ups and downs of pain.  At that point, I'm definitely comfortable to give you Vicodin.  At that point I'm definitely comfortable giving you Flexeril which is actually a muscle relaxant.  That's what DOCTOR gave you before.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Did that help you at all?  The Flexeril?

PATIENT X635
Um I had some before.  They helped you know at night you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X635
They uh you know when I go to bed you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
They helped but during the day they don't they don't do a thing.

DOCTOR X635
They don't do it okay.  Alright um the other thing of course is I'm on to your hearing loss so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna see @@@ first and talk to the nurse.  I want to see @@@.  You've never had cancer?  Right you haven't.

PATIENT X635
No, no.

DOCTOR X635
Alright very good.  Um so maybe let's start there.  @@@.  But I think DOCTOR would do it and I like to show my patients just so they understand what's going on.  You know if I kind of knew what's going on and nobody tells us cause I want to get you feeling better you know.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Um let's see here.  Okay just let me enter this.  So I'll just kind of go through what DOCTOR said.  You have a history of hypertension, the scoliosis and the lumbago, that's the back pain.  You've had ulcers in the stomach and then what it says, its kind like you've had um some blockages in the heart.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
But there's no heart attack or heart troubles.  Surgeries you had the removed parts of the ulcer.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Um you're taking the Vicodin and then the blood pressure medications.  Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X635
Uh I smoke about four or five cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
I think that's better of course than a pack you know but smoking and pain are related.

PATIENT X635
Yeah I'm, I'm weaning myself off the cigarettes.

DOCTOR X635
Okay have you ever had a colonoscopy?  This has nothing to do with your back.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
You did.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
Okay was it normal?

PATIENT X635
Uh yes.

DOCTOR X635
And when did you have that?

PATIENT X635
Just before I had the ulcer.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
Because you know I thought that when I had that colonoscopy they took a piece.

DOCTOR X635
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X635
Of my skin, they pulled a piece of my skin.

DOCTOR X635
A biopsy yeah.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.  And I was assuming that that was what caused the ulcer.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
After they you know stuck that you know probe up in there.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
And started taking stuff you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
Cause I thought maybe that caused me to have ulcers because I never did have any pain.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
In my stomach before you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yes.

PATIENT X635
It was never any pain.  I never had no kind of uh indication that I had a ulcer you know.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
And then you know and I went to the hospital they told me that I had a hole in my stomach you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
They were telling me there was a ulcer you know.

DOCTOR X635
Yeah.

PATIENT X635
That's what I found out.

DOCTOR X635
That there was a hole.  Any stomach pain since?

PATIENT X635
No.

DOCTOR X635
No.

PATIENT X635
No I never had any.

DOCTOR X635
So no blood in the stool or dark tarry stools?

PATIENT X635
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X635
Okay good.  So when did you have the operation to take the?

PATIENT X635
Uh.

DOCTOR X635
10 years ago, 5 years ago?

PATIENT X635
No about five years ago.

DOCTOR X635
About five years.  Are you allergic to anything?

PATIENT X635
No, no.

DOCTOR X635
So in terms of today what exactly do you think I could do for you today.  Are you bad enough where you think you need Vicodin?

PATIENT X635
Pardon?

DOCTOR X635
Are you bad enough where you think you need some Vicodin?

PATIENT X635
I don't, usually can I get the Norco, I think the Norco is good.

DOCTOR X635
Norco is just like two Vicodins.

PATIENT X635
Yeah but they said it don't, it don't do what Vicodin do.

DOCTOR X635
Now do you have liver troubles?

PATIENT X635
Huh?

DOCTOR X635
Do you have hepatitis or liver cancer?

PATIENT X635
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X635
No hepatitis?  

PATIENT X635
No.

DOCTOR X635
So you haven't really @@@.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
You can take as much as 4 grams of Tylenol a day.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
As far as the Tylenol right.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
And a Vicodin was 325 mg.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
So in theory you could take probably about 12 like before you start having liver trouble.

PATIENT X635
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X635
A lot of nurses don't understand that, they think all Vicodin and Tylenol is bad for your liver.

PATIENT X635
Oh.

DOCTOR X635
Um in terms of the Norco they @@@ don't let us have Norco here cause it's a stronger narcotic.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
So I prefer to keep you on Vicodin.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
But if you have you know getting them from me I'm gonna talk to my attending DOCTOR and see what she thinks about a pain consult.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
Um at this point.  But since you've only had this for two years I like the fact that you did some physical therapy.

PATIENT X635
Hmm.

DOCTOR X635
I like the fact that you're still moving around.

PATIENT X635
Hmm.

DOCTOR X635
I don't think there's anything wrong with your hip.  I don't think there's anything wrong with the back of your leg.  I think it's all coming from the back.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
But I want to get those x-rays with DOCTOR and just do some regular labs to make sure there's nothing else @@@.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
Um any questions for me or anything I didn't ask you that you think might be important?

PATIENT X635
The only thing, the nurse when she come out to the house she felt a knot, do you think it's a muscle or something that's here?

DOCTOR X635
Yeah I think you were probably having a muscle spasm secondary to this arthritis.

PATIENT X635
Cause right up there, right in where you had.

DOCTOR X635
Where I'm pressing?

PATIENT X635
No up a little bit, up a little bit.

DOCTOR X635
Right here?

PATIENT X635
Right in there, right in there.  She said @@@ or something.  She felt a bulge or something.

DOCTOR X635
I think it's, yeah there is a little bulge but I don't know if it's due to the misalignment of the spine.

PATIENT X635
Could it be a muscle or something?

DOCTOR X635
I don't know.  It's hard to say, does it hurt when I press on it?

PATIENT X635
No it doesn't hurt.

DOCTOR X635
I think it's more just because your spine is misaligned but let's get that x-ray and see if it changes.

PATIENT X635
Hmm.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
Um alright, anything else?  Any other questions or anything else bothering you?

PATIENT X635
No.

DOCTOR X635
Okay let me just take a listen.

PATIENT X635
I can't hear.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.  Have you ever worn hearing aids?

PATIENT X635
No.

DOCTOR X635
No.

PATIENT X635
But I think I need it.

DOCTOR X635
Okay.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635

DOCTOR X635

DOCTOR X635
Well I'll give you some um, I think it's important to take scheduled Tylenol, I really do.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
So taking it kind of every eight hours.  Cause pain is the kind of thing if you don't stay ahead of it it will catch up to you.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
You know so especially with a lot of these veterans who are trying to be tough you know, they say oh I can take the pain when I can take the pain meds and they wait until it gets so bad and then they really have to play catch up.

PATIENT X635
Yeah.

DOCTOR X635
So there's nothing wrong with you taking Tylenol like three times a day.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
Getting ahead of it and that's gonna be your baseline cause you're always gonna have this pain.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
I'm comfortable giving you some Vicodin to take home.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
Take it when you need it

PATIENT X635
Alright.

DOCTOR X635
I'm comfortable with giving you some muscle relaxants to take home, take it before you go to bed if the pain is really bothering you.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635
But at least start taking something or something like acetaminophen or Tylenol regularly.

PATIENT X635
Tylenol.

DOCTOR X635
Because you've bled in your stomach.

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635

PATIENT X635
Right uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635

PATIENT X635
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X635
Um I want to see an x-ray um just to make sure there's nothing going on.  Again I don't really see a mass.  I know what's she's talking about but again I think it's just because you're a little bit crooked back there.

PATIENT X635

DOCTOR X635
So let's do an x-ray and make sure there's nothing um nothing concerning.

PATIENT X635
Okay.

DOCTOR X635

DOCTOR X292 
PATIENT?

PATIENT X292
Mr. PATIENT?

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
That's me.

DOCTOR X292
Hi.

PATIENT X292
Hi.

DOCTOR X292
How's it going?

PATIENT X292
Alright.

DOCTOR X292
Have a seat back here @@@ for me.  Anything specific bring you in today?

PATIENT X292
Yep.  But we'll get to that.  First thing's is uh take care of this.  I'm not taking any of this stuff right now.  One, two and four I don't even have and number three were stopped when they took me off the naproxen.  

DOCTOR X292
Um, well these.

PATIENT X292
So what do I need?  I don't know.

DOCTOR X292
Is there, how many of them are you taking there? 

PATIENT X292
Huh?

DOCTOR X292
How many of these were you taking cause it looks like they're expired?

PATIENT X292
Right.  So aside from that, my doctor, civilian doctor called me in January because my uh prescription for my thyroid medication had expired and she said she had to see me.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
So okay so as a result of seeing her, she took my blood pressure.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
So now I'm taking this stuff.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
And then I told her that I was having trouble sleeping with the pain so she gave me this stuff.

DOCTOR X292
Hmm.  Okay.

PATIENT X292
She also had me get all of these blood tests.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
Now the reason I'm here is cause you wanted me to come in here because I wanted to see a spine specialist and the only way to do that is to get a referral from you.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
So that's why I'm here and I got another issue today.  Well it's not just today it's been for the last three weeks, this paraquadrant hurts and I think it's from getting up and down and strained something in there.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
But like if I sneeze or cough you know I get a shot in the back and the shoulder blade and all of that and uh so now it's up to you.

DOCTOR X292
Well, let's see so you have a history of spinal stenosis.

PATIENT X292
Right.

DOCTOR X292
What were you @@@ spot in here?  How do you now that you have spinal stenosis?

PATIENT X292
How do I know?

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Well other doctors in the past have told me that that's what I had.

DOCTOR X292
How did they know?

PATIENT X292
I don't know.

DOCTOR X292
Did they do an MRI?  Did they . . .

PATIENT X292
No I don't think I've had an MRI.  Uh probably based on the fact that I had the spine operation in '68 and there's a lot of scar tissue there, you know I don't know.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.  What did they do?  Why did you have a spine operation?

PATIENT X292
Cause I had a ruptured disk and they took it out or fused it.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Or whatever they did at L5.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
And since I've been having more pain, uh in that area and my SI joints some days is really a killer.  I want to get something done and have my spine examined or something.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.  You had a fusion surgery of L5?

PATIENT X292
Yeah.  I guess that's what.

DOCTOR X292
With like rods and @@@?

PATIENT X292
No, no, no rods.  He said it would fuse itself because I was so young.

DOCTOR X292
You don't have any metal in your body?

PATIENT X292
No.

DOCTOR X292
Okay, no shrapnel even?

PATIENT X292
No.

DOCTOR X292
And what are your symptoms?  You can't walk?

PATIENT X292
Well, lately I've been feeling more and more pain in the scar tissue area and in the SI joint.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
And once I stand for a while then my back starts hurting and I got to lay down and you know ease the pain and even walking from the parking lot here caused me some, not a lot of pain but some discomfort in the back you know, in the lower back, the SI joint and I want to, see I'm scheduled to get another shot at the end of this month, the 27th.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Now am I going to be wasting my time because the hip is getting the pain from the spine or what you know, because they can only do this every six, I mean every three months and it only lasts for four or five weeks you know.  

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
So am I wasting my time getting the shot you know what I mean?

DOCTOR X292
Well I think you probably have both back pain and osteoarthritis.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
So it'll help the osteoarthritis pain but we can also look into the back pain.  Just tell me a little bit more about it, what it feels like, do you have any numbness, tingling in the legs?

PATIENT X292
Well the pain in the back is a dull pain back here where the surgery was.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And the other, with the intensity of the SI joint, I don't know if it's a sharp pain, a dull pain, it's just you know really intense or what but I know the SI joint really sometimes hurts pretty bad.  

DOCTOR X292
So that is dull and sharp pain or it isn't?

PATIENT X292
You know like with the intensity of the pain, how do you tell what a sharp pain is and a dull pain is?

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know.  All I know is it hurts like heck.

DOCTOR X292
What makes it better and what makes it worse?

PATIENT X292
Well getting off my, getting off my feet makes it better.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Uh sometimes laying down makes it better.  See I can do one thing at one time and something will hurt.  I can do the same thing another time and that thing won't hurt.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.  So can you lean forward?  Like can you walk straight up or do you have to like lean forward?  Like in a store you may use a grocery cart and that makes it a little bit easier for you to walk?

PATIENT X292
Well when I got the cane I'm upright and the tendency with the shopping cart is to walk you know over, bent over you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
When I walk with the cane I'm upright.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know.

DOCTOR X292
And you're okay with that?

PATIENT X292
Yeah.  So far I can still uh; you know I still have the strength to walk with just a cane.

DOCTOR X292
Good.

PATIENT X292
But uh.

DOCTOR X292
You don't need a walker?

PATIENT X292
Not yet no but now I'm sitting here now you know.  The pain goes to different places.  Now my knee's starting to hurt see.  Back feels okay now I'm sitting upright and all back feels okay.  The hip is a little sore but the knee's starting to hurt you know.  So I don't know, it's like my body's got switches in it and somebody's in there flipping all these different switches to make the pain go to different areas.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And when the four or five weeks that the shot worked, then this was more noticeable.  The pain on this side was more noticeable.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know and uh I think it's coming up from the spine.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
But and I want to make sure if it is or isn't you know.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.  So no numbness, no tingling?

PATIENT X292
Well not that you would say constant.

DOCTOR X292
But you have it?

PATIENT X292
Well let me put it to you this way, if I sit in my recliner and I don't have any socks on, my toes hurt.

DOCTOR X292
Is there a numbness and tingling?

PATIENT X292
They get all electrified in the tips, in the toes you know.

DOCTOR X292
But only if you take off your socks?

PATIENT X292
Yeah.  If my wife puts my socks on the pain goes away.  So I don't know what that's all about you know.  I don't know if it's just a reaction to the cold air that's in the room or what, I don't know.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
You know and it uh there are times when somewhere in the body, it'll feel like somebody just took a pin and went put, you know.  

DOCTOR X292
Yeah.

PATIENT X292
It's just that and then sometimes it'll be somewhere else and another one you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
But uh I don't know.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.  How's your mood?

PATIENT X292
How's my mood?

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Uh I haven't threaten to kill anybody yet.

DOCTOR X292
So you're not depressed or unhappy?

PATIENT X292
Well naturally you're gonna have some depression with being in constant pain.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know, you uh, if you don't get a lot of sleep you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
I can go to bed; I go to bed 11:30, 12 o'clock at night.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
I'm still in bed at 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock in the morning you know because I haven't gotten some restful sleep.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah.

PATIENT X292
This stuff only lasts about four hours and then you know I wake up in pain and I'd have to take another to go back to sleep you know and so I lay there tossing and turning, trying to find a position to get rid of the pain.  So when I find a position to get rid of that pain then a different one will come.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.  So do you want the amlodipine, do want these medications on here?

PATIENT X292
Well you can give it yeah if you can sure.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.  

PATIENT X292
Cause it seems to be working because uh when I went there the blood pressure she had to take it two or three times, they took it, she said it was in the high 150s.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know, the top one and the low one was still too high too.

DOCTOR X292
Do you want 90 pills?

PATIENT X292
Sure.  I got enough to last me the rest of the week so they can mail it.

DOCTOR X292
Yep okay.  Alright, alright I think everything else you're pretty much up-to-date on.  Um we'll do labs next time you come but that's it.  Um 

PATIENT X292
So you gonna read these or what?

DOCTOR X292
Yeah I looked at them.  There's nothing abnormal about it.

PATIENT X292
Cause geez she told my vitamin D was low.

DOCTOR X292
Um wait; I didn't see the vitamin D.

PATIENT X292
She said my cholesterol was borderline high.

DOCTOR X292
We checked your cholesterol here recently and let me see if I got this right.  LDL, yeah it was high there but it wasn't, oh it was @@@ but it wasn't to @@@ get it earlier than that.   And then what are you doing for the vitamin D?

PATIENT X292
Taking uh 6000 of D3.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
If that's good or not I don't know.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.  And she gave you thyroid medications?

PATIENT X292
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X292
And she didn't start you on anything for cholesterol?

PATIENT X292
No.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
She said she wanted to do the blood tests again in two months and see if you know.  She told me to change my diet you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Then she said you make an effort to do that and then we'll see if that drops it down you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
She said it ain't real bad she said but it is uh higher than we'd like it to be.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
She said my main concern at this time was your blood pressure you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Because it was so high.  Of course the more they get me to come in there the more I gotta pay.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah.

PATIENT X292
She also told me to take my blood pressure medicine the way I'm supposed to take it instead of getting up out of bed, taking it and eating breakfast you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
She said you're supposed to do it on an empty stomach.  But uh if I could get out of bed at a decent time every day at the same time you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
It would be different but uh you know I get up and my wife's ready to eat her lunch you know.

DOCTOR X292
You get up late?

PATIENT X292
Sometimes I don't get out of bed till 12 o'clock.

DOCTOR X292
Why?

PATIENT X292
Because I'm tired.

DOCTOR X292
Hmm.

PATIENT X292
You know.  I'm so tired from not getting any restful sleep during the night.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know and four hours sleep, which is what you know that sleep stuff does, that only lasts you know for four hours.  Starting in the beginning I got six.

DOCTOR X292
Do you snore?

PATIENT X292
Probably, she says I do, I don't know, everybody snores.

DOCTOR X292
Has she ever seen you stop breathing when you snore?

PATIENT X292
No.

DOCTOR X292
Alright.

PATIENT X292
Uh sleep apnea, I don't uh wake up because I can't breathe or anything like that you know uh and if I'm snoring I don't now I'm snoring.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know.  I'm asleep.  If I'm snoring I'm getting sleep you know.

DOCTOR X292
You might have sleep apnea.  Do you want a sleep study?

PATIENT X292
Ah.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.  It'll help you feel.  If you have sleep apnea you'll feel more rested after they put you on a CPAP if you have sleep apnea and that'll help you feel more rested.  

PATIENT X292
Well since you can't sleep because of the pain what is the sleep test gonna do?

DOCTOR X292
Well I mean the pain, like if you're not sleeping and the pain can be worse but if it makes you go on to sleep then you maybe, you may have less pain.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
But it's up to you.  I mean if you're not, if you really don't think that you know your breathing is stopping when you're sleeping.

PATIENT X292
I don't really think so no.

DOCTOR X292
But you are at risk because you're overweight and you're snoring so the likelihood that you have sleep apnea if nothing else @@@.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
So.  It is not, it seems reasonable to do a sleep study.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.  And then what does that entail?

DOCTOR X292
Um you just come here.  I don't know if they do it early in the evening of if they do it at the end of the day.  Basically they record you sleeping and so that it's close to @@@.

PATIENT X292
What if you can't, what if you can't go to sleep?

DOCTOR X292
Um I think they ask you to come in sleep-deprived so that you do.  You know.

PATIENT X292
I'm sleep deprived now.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah.  So you should be able to fall asleep.  I don't know if they give you medications to make you fall asleep or not.  They may.

PATIENT X292
You know it's strange because I get all kinds of different pains.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And I have gone to the Naprapath.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And laid on his table.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And I could go to sleep just like that.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Now why I don't know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know cause I was going to him to get some heat compresses and you know on the area there.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And uh, after about half an hour I'm almost asleep.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know cause he leaves the room and all that you know.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And I, its just I guess its just what that's made out of, the firmness of it and all of that that I could sleep on.  I'm sure my mattress could be a lot harder than it is but uh my said it's hard enough.  Although we don't sleep together anymore, she still said she's not going to get another mattress that's harder.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
So what can I do?

DOCTOR X292
So what do think, sleep study or not?

PATIENT X292
When will it be?

DOCTOR X292
Whenever you're ready, they can schedule it for you.

PATIENT X292
Yeah, try anything.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
Eliminate as much as I can.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.  We'll try that.  Um okay I want to just take a look at you.  So first let's just have you put your leg up.  And why do you have this difficulty getting up?  Pain in your knees or pain in your back or?

PATIENT X292
But he told me that I was supposed to wear it around here see.

DOCTOR X292

PATIENT X292
Okay.  So I put it away and a couple two or three weeks ago when I was having trouble going to sleep I put it on and went to bed but I didn't put it, I put it around my stomach.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And went to bed and gee I had a good night so I'm wearing it a lot, every night when I go to bed now I'm wearing it.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know.  But I need to know about the spine, if there's anything maybe I need to have to.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
@@@.

DOCTOR X292
Have you ever had physical therapy?

PATIENT X292
Yeah well, I went to Physical Therapy for six visits.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
And.

DOCTOR X292
Was it for your knee or your back?

PATIENT X292
Well all they did was.

DOCTOR X292
Your legs?

PATIENT X292
Oh for the legs and all that.

DOCTOR X292
Did they give you a TENS.

PATIENT X292
They gave me a TENS you know and that helps while it's on.  You can make movements that you can't make before you put it on.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
But then again after you take it off then you're back to where you started again.  You still can't make those movements.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You can only make them while the unit is on.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
You know.  So, every once in a while I put it on but I don't use it on a regular basis.

DOCTOR X292
And you haven't had physical therapy for your back yet right?

PATIENT X292
No.  I don't know what they could do, what kind of physical therapy could they do for my back?

DOCTOR X292
They'll teach you exercises and things.  If you could strengthen up the muscles it'll help control your pain.

PATIENT X292
Well I don't know how you can strengthen up muscles that you can't move because it causes too much pain.

DOCTOR X292
Right.

PATIENT X292
You know.  How do you exercise something that hurts?

DOCTOR X292
Right.  They'll teach you how to stretch and kind of relieve some of that pain with some stretching.

PATIENT X292
Okay whatever.

DOCTOR X292

Did you have symptoms of hypothyroidism?

PATIENT X292

DOCTOR X292

Well when this all first started, uh 20 some years ago, my fingers, tips of my fingers is what got the doctor to get me the thyroid tests.

DOCTOR X292

PATIENT X292
So.

DOCTOR X292
And that decreased the.

PATIENT X292
Well that went away yeah after I took the pills yeah.

DOCTOR X292
You weren't having any constipation or you weren't cold all the time or you didn't have decreased energy?

PATIENT X292
No.  Uh cause it turns out uh my wife's got hypothyroidism, my son's got hypothyroidism, uh my sister's got hypothyroidism so I guess it's a genetic thing.

DOCTOR X292
But the only symptom that you had was numbness in the fingers?

PATIENT X292
Yeah.

DOCTOR X292
Nothing else, no constipation?

PATIENT X292
No.

You may have constipation; you may have, with hypothyroidism and then when she found that your numbers were off this time did you have any of those symptoms?

PATIENT X292
No.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.  Um, let's see.  We'll get the x-rays um; we're going to get them today.

PATIENT X292
You know the tiredness that's uh; you can't attribute it to the hypothyroidism now today because I'm not getting any sleep you know.

DOCTOR X292
Right.  I'll um, okay we need to get that and then um, the physical therapy we can order that.  

PATIENT X292
Should I still go through with the shot?

DOCTOR X292
From Ortho today?

PATIENT X292
Yeah.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah.

PATIENT X292
Oh.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah whatever makes you feel better you should do and how has your pain been controlled with the medications you're on, the tramadol, the hydrocodone?

PATIENT X292
I told you I ain't on any of that.  I'm not taking any of it.

DOCTOR X292
Why not?

PATIENT X292
I don't have any of it.  The only thing I got is that opta, whatever it is and that was only for when I was on the naproxen.

DOCTOR X292
Oh okay.  You have a history of a GI bleed right?

PATIENT X292
Right.

DOCTOR X292
And have you had any follow up endoscopies?

PATIENT X292
No.

DOCTOR X292
Okay we should do a follow-up endoscopy too.

PATIENT X292
Yeah.

DOCTOR X292
They haven't looked since 2010?

PATIENT X292
No.

DOCTOR X292
Okay we should do that too.

PATIENT X292
Why?

DOCTOR X292
Um just to make sure that the ulcer has healed.

PATIENT X292
Hmm.  I think I had to go to sleep right?

DOCTOR X292
Um they, it's called conscious sedation.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
Let me put in that consult too, we need to really schedule that.  @@@ their clinic.  You know do mind going to the Lab today?

PATIENT X292
For what?

DOCTOR X292
To get a blood draw, because normally when you're seen by the GI doctors who do the scope.

PATIENT X292
Yeah.

DOCTOR X292
They want to make sure that you don't have any problems with your blood test.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
So we need to order the labs for that.  Are you taking any aspirin or anything?

PATIENT X292
No.  The other thing I was taking but I haven't taken it for two days was vitamin C.

DOCTOR X292
Are you out of those medications, cause you have refills?

PATIENT X292
I never sent the things in.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah you can call and tell them to send it in.

PATIENT X292
Yeah.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah.  You have plenty of refills.

PATIENT X292
Yeah.  I know.  Do you know how many bottles of naproxen I got that I never ordered you know?

DOCTOR X292
Oh.  Sometimes they just send it.  The narcotics they probably won't send unless you ask for them.

PATIENT X292
Right but uh the naproxen I got.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.  Yeah.

PATIENT X292
I must have 600 pills of that stuff cause it just kept coming.
Trying to deal with the pain without taking a whole lot of medication, that's why I'm so concerned about getting the spine looked at.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
Because I'm sure that if it is the spine, whatever they can do to correct it will eliminate a lot of the pain and I won't have to be on the medication.

DOCTOR X292
Well with spinal stenosis it is a chronic pain already. 

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
Okay.

PATIENT X292
Well I want to find out if there's any, if they could find out what's wrong if there's a way to correct it.  If there ain't no way to correct it then what can I do you know.  I can't do nothing.

DOCTOR X292
Right.

PATIENT X292
But uh.

DOCTOR X292
Would you be willing to have surgery?

PATIENT X292
Yeah.  If that would correct it.  You know uh I don't want to just numb the pain; I want to try and get to the source of the pain and get rid of it if that's possible.  If it's not possible well then it's not possible.

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X292
But you know that's uh my goal cause I got lots of years left.

DOCTOR X292
Yeah.

PATIENT X292
Let's try it.

DOCTOR X292
Okay, well let me, you can schedule you're appointment with me.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
Um, well I don't think you're going to be able schedule with me; the clinic is going to call you so just ask up front if it's possible.

PATIENT X292
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X292
Okay and now I guess we go through the nurse; we want to do a pain assessment so go ahead and just walk you over there.

PATIENT X292
A pain assessment.

DOCTOR X292
You know you're in pain right?

PATIENT X292
Yeah.

DOCTOR X292
So we have to assess.

PATIENT X292
Right, what do they have to assess me?  How are they going to feel it to assess it?

DOCTOR X292
Uh-huh well hopefully we'll get these x-rays, get some NSAIDs, get some physical therapy and then I'll most likely be referring, it sounds like its spinal stenosis.  I'll most likely be referring you to um the Anesthesia Pain Clinic.

PATIENT X292
So they gonna do injections?

DOCTOR X292
Yeah they can do injections.

PATIENT X292
What kind?  What do they call them?

DOCTOR X292
Epidural injections.

PATIENT X292
An epidural or something like that yeah.  I had a guy that wanted to do that last year but it was gonna cost me $3000. 

DOCTOR X292
Well it won't cost you that much here.  So go ahead and sit in the chair now.  Alright.  (Doctor speaking to someone)  You can wait over here and the person who is assessing you will be back okay and then you're gonna go check out and then you're gonna go get the x-ray.  Okay.  And you probably stop by the Pharmacy and get those medicines if you want just call and they'll mail them.

PATIENT X292

DOCTOR X667
Uh do you have enough supplies?  I know I renewed them all the last time.

PATIENT X667
The only thing I don't have is Bacitracin but I can get that.  I been getting stuff at Walgreen’s anyway.

DOCTOR X667
Okay and it's still draining just like what it was draining the last time huh.

PATIENT X667
Yes.

DOCTOR X667
Okay and you're taking, what medications are you taking by mouth?  The HIV's?

PATIENT X667
HIV, ibuprofen.

DOCTOR X667
@@@?

PATIENT X667
Yeah, they gave me some, the doctor didn't tell me to take it but I been taking it because I have this infection on my neck.

DOCTOR X667
Who gave you that?

PATIENT X667
The doctor gave me some supplements, sulfa some kind of name or something.

DOCTOR X667
@@@?

PATIENT X667
Yeah, anyway I been taking it and they told me to stop.  I started like taking it and it almost cleared this stuff up, it's a bacteria.

DOCTOR X667
Okay.  You have the tinea cruris, this is forever.

PATIENT X667
I put @@@ last month when I came to see you, it was bad.  It was a hole in my neck.

DOCTOR X667
Okay.

PATIENT X667
It was a hole there and it was almost through the skin so you could see the bone in my throat but it's closing up now and so.  It's the @@@ core infection where it feels like something @@@ and um it is beneath the skin, it's not contagious or anything.  The dermatologist is not doing anything.

DOCTOR X667
Oh I remember this, I remember it now.

PATIENT X667
Yeah what's happening is things crawling on my skin, they like @@@ but they white and they crawl through my skin and I, I have to have that and it's starting to clear up.

DOCTOR X667
I remember you were seeing a dermatologist about it.

PATIENT X667
Yes and it's clearing up.  They tried to tell me it was eczema and I don't have no eczema that radical.

DOCTOR X667
Yeah.  Have a seat up here.  I am really sorry this would happen with the medications @@@?

PATIENT X667
Oh, @@@ I just didn't know.

DOCTOR X667
No it's good for me to know because it's important just to make sure.

PATIENT X667
He done told me that my HIV is non-detectable now.

DOCTOR X667
Yeah your HIV, so you got labs done, it looks on the 14th.

PATIENT X667
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X667
Right now it's pending but we're gonna have your CD4 count, which is your cell count and hopefully and your viral loads, the virus in your blood looks really good.

PATIENT X667
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X667
So it's good you're taking your medications.  It's ideal so you're not as prone to complications with the HIV.

PATIENT X667
What I'm thinking is that if I could stay on it, hopefully it'll improve.

DOCTOR X667
Yeah.  I'm just trying to see, I can't remember where.

PATIENT X667
It's one of those things you know it's draining now.

DOCTOR X667
I remember.

PATIENT X667
It might just date it.

DOCTOR X667
Oh right here.

PATIENT X667
It's small, it's about right here.

DOCTOR X667
Ah.  Is it sore when I go like this?

PATIENT X667
Yeah, it's still sore.

DOCTOR X667
So did you just see them, has that been recent?

PATIENT X667
It's draining, it's draining, it's draining but it's not big.  @@@.

DOCTOR X667
Okay.

PATIENT X667
So what I'm saying is that everything is okay, the way that they told me what's gonna happen, my legs is, all the skin is gonna break down on my legs again.  As long as I keep this going on.

DOCTOR X667
When do you see Podiatry?

PATIENT X667
Only in about another two weeks is when it is.

DOCTOR X667
Okay, deep breath.  Okay look up.  Alright, have a seat.  

PATIENT X667
Okay.

DOCTOR X667
Um so you have enough of your supplies.  They already sent your medications.

PATIENT X667
I did get them yeah.

DOCTOR X667
So you're good right now.

PATIENT X667
The only @@@ if I'm gonna have the medication @@@ gotta go to Walgreen’s, the reason I'm saying that is.

DOCTOR X667
I can give the bacitracin.

PATIENT X667
Yeah.

DOCTOR X667
I'll fill it definitely.

PATIENT X667
That's what I need.

DOCTOR X667
@@@.

PATIENT X667
Cause I'm trying to keep the infection down.

DOCTOR X667
That'll be great.

PATIENT X667
Anyway, the office and the forms @@@, pretty soon we'll have to have you @@@.  I don't have no @@@.  You hear what I'm saying, I'm waiting for this to stop draining before I @@@.

DOCTOR X667
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X667
Then in the meantime with this much gauze and compressed on it.

DOCTOR X667
Yeah.

PATIENT X667
It's keeping the swelling down.

DOCTOR X667
Okay.

PATIENT X667
So they wasn't complaining about me putting that on there.

DOCTOR X667
Well I'm going to refill your bacitracin now.

PATIENT X667
Okay.

DOCTOR X667
There's no point @@@.

PATIENT X667
So, now what do I do when I pick the form up today?  Just drop it here?

DOCTOR X667
You can drop it off with my nurse and I'll just get it to them within the week okay.

PATIENT X667
Okay.

DOCTOR X667
@@@ today for some reason other than @@@.

PATIENT X667
Oh no, I'm not even worrying about it.

DOCTOR X667
Um.

PATIENT X667
I'm just happy they got the lady that had my forms @@@.

DOCTOR X667
Yeah I'm glad to see you.

PATIENT X667
Cause actually I'm trying to stick to the VA.

DOCTOR X667
Yeah.

PATIENT X667
Before I die.

DOCTOR X667
Don't say things like that.

PATIENT X667
They told me that if I made it another hour, see I was bad when I had that bad infection in my neck.

DOCTOR X667
It's scary with infections.

PATIENT X667
And so what I'm saying is the VA are the ones that saved my life because still with the Air Force, sometime go to a hospital with the Air Force I would've died because I wouldn't have gotten medical care in time.  If something happens I can come to the VA Hospital.

DOCTOR X667
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X667
Emergency Room and things do happen in life, know what I'm saying so that's why I did that you know.  But I need to get more of the medical insurance which I'm attempting to do now.

DOCTOR X667
Okay.

PATIENT X667
I don't know lately if the HIV, it kind of feels like @@@.

DOCTOR X667
What do you mean like?

PATIENT X667
Why my leg does that.  They say I have osteomyelitis in my legs.

DOCTOR X667
It's in the legs yeah.  That could be.

PATIENT X667
And the veins in the leg and all that.

DOCTOR X667
Um, we'll probably gonna have you get a MRI but I want the doctor, the HIV doctors to see you for that okay.

PATIENT X667
Okay.

DOCTOR X667
I'll be right back for the pain in your tummy.

PATIENT X667
Okay.

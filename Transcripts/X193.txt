DOCTOR X193
PATIENT?

PATIENT X193
Yep.  

DOCTOR X193
Pleased to meet you.  @@@.  Hmm, who is your primary, I'm following your comments.

PATIENT X193
I had.

DOCTOR X193
What happened?

PATIENT X193
I can't even remember @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Oh okay, so what brings you in today?

PATIENT X193
Well actually it's several things.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
The main one is my breathing pattern with some anxiety, @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Oh, okay.

PATIENT X193
The last several times @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
But I also have some blood in my stool.

DOCTOR X193
Today?

PATIENT X193
Not today, some days.

DOCTOR X193
Okay how much blood is in it. 

PATIENT X193
Serious amounts, it's about the color of that switch right there where that help is.

DOCTOR X193
How many times have you had happen?

PATIENT X193
Just that one time.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
But it scared me to see it was all clotted up and bright red @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
And I knew I hadn't eaten anything that would cause that.

DOCTOR X193
Right.

PATIENT X193
Uh there's a possibility that you know a hemorrhoid popped or something.

DOCTOR X193
Yeah.

PATIENT X193
I guess that's a possibility that I would have thought.

DOCTOR X193
Did you have rectal pain?

PATIENT X193
No.

DOCTOR X193
No pain when you were wiping?

PATIENT X193
No, except there was blood.

DOCTOR X193
So did you see blood when you were wiping?

PATIENT X193
Right.

DOCTOR X193
Without even wiping?

PATIENT X193
Oh no, I looked in the bowl.  You know, I could tell something wasn't right because the stool was a little bit loose.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
And so I was looking down and oh my God, there was a lot of blood.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
And uh I'm gonna guess, if I were measuring it probably a quarter cup of.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
Of serious uh blood.  Now I also noticed that here lately my urine has been darkening up quite a bit.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
Which in the olden days that would have been indicating my rheumatic fever was acting up uh; however, I don't think I that's the case any more.  There's a real heavy odor to it.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
Uh, I'm concerned.  I tell you what, I take @@@ uh Humira. 

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
For RA and I know that it masks the symptoms of cancer.

DOCTOR X193
Hmm.

PATIENT X193
And that's my major concern, yeah that's the way it goes.

DOCTOR X193
Is that, do you have bladder cancer?

PATIENT X193
Well I don't know it could be liver, it could be kidney or anything.  It could be a lot of different kinds.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.  Okay.

PATIENT X193
Uh could I have rectal cancer?  Is that a possibility?  I could have something like that @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
So uh, so I'm more than a little concerned about the blood so.

DOCTOR X193
Right.

PATIENT X193
And I'm hoping that you send me downstairs and get a series of tests done.

DOCTOR X193
Yeah the only problem is, well let's see.  Just to have things come back faster.

PATIENT X193
Uh-huh, well you don't have to do it faster.

DOCTOR X193
You know we may.  How's your breathing?

PATIENT X193
My breathing right now is uh; let me put it this way, its worse if I lay down.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
I've got mucous so I need a mucolytic of some sort.

DOCTOR X193
You're coughing up a lot?

PATIENT X193
In the morning I cough up a hairball, I mean a really hard matter of smack.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.  Does it feel like your COPD?

PATIENT X193
I'm sure that the COPD is uh being uh fed by the uh drainage.  You know I'm sure that it's causing the COPD to react.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.  Postnasal drainage?

PATIENT X193
Yeah.

DOCTOR X193
Okay when did all of this start?

PATIENT X193
Oh God it's been @@@.  A couple times I've been in.

DOCTOR X193
I mean is @@@ coming and going?

PATIENT X193
Well actually it never seems to go away.  It lightens up a while when I'm taking the antibiotics and the prednisone.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
And almost two, three days later I'm right back where I left.  I've had this a number of times now so I don't, they're pretty sure it's an exacerbation of COPD, probably being caused by the postnasal drainage and the fact that, you know when you stop @@@ it makes it a little harder to get a breath in to begin with and then you start you know coughing @@@.

DOCTOR X193
So when were your last @@@ thing?

PATIENT X193
Well about four weeks ago.  No two weeks ago cause I @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Okay and when are you going to see DOCTOR again?

PATIENT X193
I think that's the end of next week.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
I could be wrong but you can check that.  I think possibly next Thursday I see him.

DOCTOR X193
Um have you been treated off and on with prednisone and antibiotics.

PATIENT X193
Yeah.

DOCTOR X193
For years?

PATIENT X193
Probably even longer than that.

DOCTOR X193
Off and on?

PATIENT X193
Off and on.  Since I came back from Arizona two years ago I've felt, at first they saw stuff in my lungs and x-rays and CAT scans that they couldn't figure out and uh they thought that maybe you know there was a possibility I had some kind of a disease or a fungal disease cause I'd been out in the southwest.  

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
It turned out that wasn't the case.  They tested for I can't tell you how many different types and they know I've got COPD.  They know that I have some kind of issue that's causing the drainage so.  And eventually I keep getting sicker with breathing problems.

DOCTOR X193
Do you feel like your breathing is more labored?

PATIENT X193
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X193
Are you wheezing more or?

PATIENT X193
Well actually I do wheeze but then it's more a medical treatment.  It's hard really to know to say which one was worse; it's the fact that it's hard to get a breath.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
Or sometimes @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Do you have a neb machine at home?

PATIENT X193
Yes I do and it's actually in my car.  I have @@@ in my car.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.  Have you given yourself a breathing treatment today?

PATIENT X193
Uh I may have taken about three.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
One on the way here and two before that and I have taken a puff of albuterol.  

DOCTOR X193
And you're coughing up more sputum.  What color is it?

PATIENT X193
Grey.  The infection is pretty ended at this point.

DOCTOR X193
@@@.  You've had a fever today?

PATIENT X193
I got a fever right now.  Uh I was at 98 something she said.

DOCTOR X193
What do you normally run?

PATIENT X193
I'm normal at 97.6, 97.4.

DOCTOR X193
Are you that warm at home?

PATIENT X193
Yeah, I'll actually may walk halfway to the top and end up having to restart @@@.  So if I have a cold or something to go along with all those issues, that's a problem too.  So I end up taking a cold medicine at this point in time.

DOCTOR X193
Any chills?

PATIENT X193
Well, actually what happens is you take your shirt off cause you're just soaking wet and oh I try to dry off as best I can.

DOCTOR X193
Yeah.

PATIENT X193
But then yeah eventually I start being like chilled.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.  So kind of warm and chilled for how long now?

PATIENT X193
That's been going on for at least a week.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.  Have you been tested for tuberculosis?

PATIENT X193
Yes.

DOCTOR X193
Okay when did you have that?

PATIENT X193
About 500 times.  Well the first time has been about ten years or eight years ago when they started me on Humira but every third year, two years ago or three years ago when I went there @@@ when I came back, that report was one of the top things on the list that they were worried about so they went ahead and gave me the @@@ steps and uh I think I've gotten two or three times subsequently.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
Just in case.  And the x-ray, I've looked at that and prevention is a couple of things here but do I think that's the problem now, uh probably not.  Now I'll be happy to take a stress test if you want it but my concern is possible cancer and uh I mean I could probably get by until next week and see DOCTOR to get the prednisone and the antibiotics.

DOCTOR X193
When was your last chest x-ray?  October.

PATIENT X193
Uh.

DOCTOR X193
You had a CT in April.

PATIENT X193
Yep.

DOCTOR X193
You had a chest x-ray before then.

PATIENT X193
Yeah I think I've got another CT coming up next Thursday.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.  Uh you're probably right in the middle where you look fine but some of your symptoms are concerning and you need the breathing treatments @@@ and of course you have fevers.

PATIENT X193
Yeah.

DOCTOR X193
Uh I want to talk about @@@ about you going home with the treatment that you had before or maybe going to the Emergency Room so that you can have a chest x-ray and get it read, you get @@@, we get everything that you need @@@ you know.  Uh we'll see let me talk to my attending.

PATIENT X193
Okay.  Whatever.

DOCTOR X193
And then the blood in the stool, so that happened how many times?

PATIENT X193
It's happened more than once but this one was @@@.

DOCTOR X193
So how long has that been going on?

PATIENT X193
Wasn't the same.

DOCTOR X193
The blood in the stool?

PATIENT X193
Uh probably several months but that's, you know I had treated it probably because I couldn't handle it you know and it was never in this large of amount.  You know I would go back and wipe and you know there's a little blood or something like that it's uh.

DOCTOR X193
When was your last colonoscopy?

PATIENT X193
Uh I want to say two years, three years ago.

DOCTOR X193
Was that here?

PATIENT X193
Yeah.  Yeah I've had a couple of them actually.

DOCTOR X193
@@@.

PATIENT X193
Uh probably three weeks ago.

DOCTOR X193
I don't see where it was done.

PATIENT X193
Pardon?

DOCTOR X193
I don't see that it was done.

PATIENT X193
You don't see that it was done.

DOCTOR X193
I see that they took @@@.

PATIENT X193
Oh no, I've had two of them.

DOCTOR X193
@@@.  

PATIENT X193
Yeah I've had two and they were all negative.

DOCTOR X193
Okay did you feel dizzy or like you were going to pass out?

PATIENT X193
When they did it?

DOCTOR X193
When you had the blood in your stool on Sunday?

PATIENT X193
Actually yeah I did feel a little bit lightheaded.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.  We did @@@.  @@@ a problem?  You started tamsulosin.  A little prostate problem @@@ but they didn't say that @@@.  How did you find out about @@@?

PATIENT X193
Well uh I guess guy to another, @@@ normally prostate @@@ mentioned.  Not that they were serious or anything.

DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.  Okay.

PATIENT X193
Usually once a year somebody's got a prostate gland you know they were problem inflamed one time.

DOCTOR X193
Well how often were you having this blood in your stool before?

PATIENT X193
It's not like it was that often and it certainly was never that much.

DOCTOR X193
Every other month?  Every day or every week?

PATIENT X193
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR X193
Every week?

PATIENT X193
No nothing like that and when I could see it I'd put Prep H on that and you know pretty much.

DOCTOR X193
Are you constipated?  Do you strain for a bowel movement?

PATIENT X193
No.

DOCTOR X193
So how often was it happening?

PATIENT X193
You know it was infrequent let's put it that way.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
Did it happen with any regularity no.  Uh did it occur, in a large amount like this no.  Usually it's just a trace amount.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
And uh like I said in this case it was totally loose stool so then you've got no straining, no cause for a rupture of a hemorrhoid.

DOCTOR X193
And the blood was mixed with the stool?

PATIENT X193
Yes.

DOCTOR X193
Did you pass out?

PATIENT X193
No.

DOCTOR X193

DOCTOR X193
No blood that you can see in the urine?

PATIENT X193
What's that?

DOCTOR X193
Can you see blood in the urine?

PATIENT X193
You know it could be blood that's causing it to darken @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Have you seen blood?

PATIENT X193
Specifically no.

DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
But I mean I know that if blood mixes with urine that it darkens it.

DOCTOR X193

DOCTOR X193

PATIENT X193
I think the pink one starts with an A.

DOCTOR X193
Deep breath.  Breath out, deep breath in and out.  Deep breath in and out.  Okay.  You can breathe normally.  Can you lie back?  @@@.

DOCTOR X193
Yeah they can give you IV steroids.  You can't give yourself that.

PATIENT X193
Nope.  That's true but I don't think we need to do that do we?

DOCTOR X193
We may need to.

DOCTOR X193

PATIENT X193
Thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  152:00  DOCTOR IN:  158:20)

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Hi PATIENT, how are you?

PATIENT X193
How you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Not too bad, yourself?

PATIENT X193
Not bad.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
So uh DOCTOR was just telling me what's going on here.  You're coughing more and uh you know.  Let me just listen to your lungs here.  Can you take a deep breath, out, again.  Okay and you're also having um bloody stools?  Okay.  So you know it's fairly complex a history and there is some wheezing in your lungs.

PATIENT X193
That's been going on for a while though, they know about that.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Yeah, yeah, no I mean most of your wheezing is that type of history but your coughing and you're producing, you need a chest x-ray and things like that alright.

PATIENT X193
I have no problem with that.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
And the stool we need to follow up at the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X193
@@@ get it here.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
We can't do it out of here in this clinic.  You need to go to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X193
Oh, you can't give me, have me go downstairs?

SECOND DOCTOR X193
No you need to go to the Emergency Room to follow up with that okay.  Because it's going to take hours for a routine test to be read by the radiologist, the radiologist has to read it, we can't read the films.  So the only facility here after hours is the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X193
Okay, I never want to go there so.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Yeah.

PATIENT X193
That's why I came here to begin with.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
No I know.

PATIENT X193
If I wanted to go straight there I'd of done that and I.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Yeah.

PATIENT X193
I don't feel like sitting around for ten hours.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
But you know you have uh.

PATIENT X193
I've got a machine in the car.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Blood in your stool and things like that, they're going to need to check your.

PATIENT X193
Well that's why I came here.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Yeah.

PATIENT X193
You guys would write a thing, I'd go downstairs to the Lab and they'd run whatever tests you need.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Yeah we can do that but we need to follow up with that.  If there's been emergency stuff then.  How long have you been having bloody stools @@@?

PATIENT X193
Well like I told her one time.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
On Sunday.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X193
Sunday I had blood and like I was telling her a quarter cup probably @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Do you have hemorrhoids?

PATIENT X193
I've been told I had some but she couldn't see any so.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
He's had a colonoscopy before @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Okay what we can do is just the original plan, the Z-Pak, uh blood work.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Blood work.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
The steroids and then you can follow up with your pulmonologist.

PATIENT X193
I'll see him next Thursday anyway.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
And after that we'll see if his medications need to be changed.  I don't think we need to @@@ the medications.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Just the steroid, Z-Pak and then the blood work.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
And a chest x-ray.

PATIENT X193
Can they get a mucolytic to cut down on the amount of the secretions?

SECOND DOCTOR X193
No, the antibiotics should help with that okay.

PATIENT X193
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
We don't want that necessarily.

PATIENT X193
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
Okay.  Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Okay, take care.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
I'll put that in for your blood work at the Lab and your antibiotics and steroids.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Yeah if you get worse you need to come to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X193
I will.  Thank you.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
No problem.

PATIENT X193
You've been @@@.  Now about a urine test for @@@ matter?

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Yeah she can order all that.  @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
So that's the thing, I mean you probably should have been evaluated in the Emergency Room.  They can follow up with all of these things but.

PATIENT X193
But you can do the tests here I mean.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
Not after hours we can’t.

PATIENT X193
Oh I see what you're saying.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
It's going to take and it's going to delay, overnight.

PATIENT X193
Well I'm not going to die in the next 24 hours.  If something gets worse @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
That's what I'm talking about, overnight if something happens you need to come to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X193
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Okay.

PATIENT X193
That's fine.

FIRST DOCTOR X193
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Thanks DOCTOR.

PATIENT X193
Thank you doc.

SECOND DOCTOR X193
Thank you take care.

DOCTOR X319
How are you?

PATIENT X319
Fine doctor.

DOCTOR X319
Good morning how are you?

PATIENT X319
I'm doing fine except for high blood sugars.

DOCTOR X319
Your sugars are running high?

PATIENT X319
Yes and I'm watching it carefully.

DOCTOR X319
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X319
And it's still high.

DOCTOR X319
When goes high it's exhausting to you huh.

PATIENT X319
Well I got everything here with me.  Going back, I keep two log books.

DOCTOR X319
Well let me see it.

PATIENT X319
That's where I just stopped it.

DOCTOR X319
Hmm.  How long have you noticed that the sugars have been high?

PATIENT X319
About, off and on, for the past two months.

DOCTOR X319
Two months they've been high.  And you had 186 today when we got labs.  Your hemoglobin A1c was a little, let me see what's it's been in the past first.  I'm going to have to look it up.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
But it was considerably running a little bit higher.  Right?

PATIENT X319
Yeah.

DOCTOR X319
And they asked when I called you and saw you in the ED, were you in the Emergency Department?

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
What was the story about that?

PATIENT X319
That was a racing heart.

DOCTOR X319
Racing heart.  How has that been?  Have you had that anymore?

PATIENT X319
No because they told me I was dehydrated.

DOCTOR X319
Okay.

PATIENT X319
And uh so I'm drinking more water.

DOCTOR X319
Yeah.

PATIENT X319
And my record from here.

DOCTOR X319
Oh so you've been keeping track of your pulse and everything.

PATIENT X319
Yeah.

DOCTOR X319
That's good.  You haven't had any more high, since you've got, you've been drinking more water, you get out of the.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
Do you feel fine?

PATIENT X319
Yes.  There it is there from there down to regional so it's pretty good.

DOCTOR X319
You @@@.

PATIENT X319
Yeah oh.

DOCTOR X319
Have you been urinating more frequently?

PATIENT X319
A lot.

DOCTOR X319
Okay.

PATIENT X319
Yeah.  And that's still elevated.  @@@ with a scale.

DOCTOR X319
And that's been going on for about two months you say?

PATIENT X319
Yes.  I didn't pay that much attention to it until like one day that I came in to the ER.  I woke up and I was kind of dizzy.

DOCTOR X319
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X319
And uh my pulse was 123.

DOCTOR X319
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X319
So I called the nurse and she told me to come in to the ER and have it checked out.  That's when they said that I was dehydrated.

DOCTOR X319
Let's see what @@@.  What medicines you're on metformin you're taking?

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
And then the glipizide.

PATIENT X319
Glipizide yeah.

DOCTOR X319
You're just taking 5 mg of that?

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
Okay, so we might restart some more.

PATIENT X319
Yeah.

DOCTOR X319
How long have you been on the glipizide, that dose?

PATIENT X319
Oh I've been on for quite a while, a year easily I suppose.  Yeah the doctor down there was suggesting I increase the glipizide maybe.

DOCTOR X319
No they didn't do it, did they tell you to increase it there or no?

PATIENT X319
No, no, she didn't no.  But she said maybe I should.

DOCTOR X319
When do you take your sugars?  Do you tend to take them after, in the mornings or after you eat or?

PATIENT X319
The metformin?

DOCTOR X319
No the sugar, what time do you check your blood sugars during the day?

PATIENT X319
Oh uh just at different times.

DOCTOR X319
All different times okay.

PATIENT X319
Yeah, I take them first thing in the morning.  I take them two hours after breakfast.

DOCTOR X319
After you eat.  Have you noticed was one time higher than the others?

PATIENT X319
No I haven't noticed really no.

DOCTOR X319
Okay.  And no chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X319
No I didn't chest pain, all I had was a little bit of shortness of breath.

DOCTOR X319
You had a little shortness of breath.

PATIENT X319
Yeah.  But nothing since.

DOCTOR X319
Good.  Had you been doing anything more strenuous before that day outside, doing work?

PATIENT X319
No.

DOCTOR X319
Nothing, no.

PATIENT X319
No, no.

DOCTOR X319
Um and no swelling in the legs or anything like that?

PATIENT X319
No, no, no, nothing like that.

DOCTOR X319
No pain with urination, you're just going more?

PATIENT X319
No going more yeah.

DOCTOR X319
Have you been felt more thirsty?  Do you feel thirsty?

PATIENT X319
No I don't really no.

DOCTOR X319
Did you feel that day, when you, do you feel like your heart was beating fast or racing?

PATIENT X319
I did yes.

DOCTOR X319
You did.  Did it come on all of a sudden or did it come on kind of gradually.

PATIENT X319
Well it was when I got up.

DOCTOR X319
As soon as you got up you noticed it?

PATIENT X319
As soon as I got up yeah.

DOCTOR X319
Had you ever had anything like that, feeling like that before?

PATIENT X319
I had.  I had uh I think once before I had that but I didn't pay any attention to it.

DOCTOR X319
You didn't.

PATIENT X319
It doesn't last, you know it goes away.

DOCTOR X319
Yeah, so how long did you have it that day cause when you got to the ED it looks like the heart rate was back to.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
Near normal.

PATIENT X319
Yeah.  Right.  That's how it's been, that's how it was.  Uh, it would last maybe half hour, an hour.

DOCTOR X319
And then go away?

PATIENT X319
And then go away yeah.

DOCTOR X319
How fast was it going?  Did you check it when you woke up that morning?

PATIENT X319
Yeah it was 123.

DOCTOR X319
Yeah you were definitely running low.  You were dehydrated when you came in.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
It looks like your orthostatic you recall when they did the tests.

PATIENT X319
Now the other thing that uh, I get Prilosec and I know that the side effects of Prilosec is a fast heart rate.

DOCTOR X319
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X319
Uh DOCTOR prescribed it.

DOCTOR X319
How long ago?

PATIENT X319
I've been on them for the past year.

DOCTOR X319
Okay.  It shouldn't, I wouldn't expect it to uh.

PATIENT X319
To do that.

DOCTOR X319
Do that.  No the way it sounds, it sounds like more like you were possibly be dehydrated more than anything.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
Since you responded well with just the fluids and especially with all this urinating and stuff.  You're probably losing some glucose out your urine.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
Which is why you're peeing in your urine.

PATIENT X319
Yeah they told me that yeah, right.

DOCTOR X319
Um so that's probably in the note yeah.  But no fevers, chills?

PATIENT X319
No.

DOCTOR X319
No belly pain @@@?

PATIENT X319
No nothing, nothing at all no.

DOCTOR X319
Nothing like that.  Let me look you over here once, just sit over here for me.  Some deep breaths for me.  Open your mouth for me.  You didn't have any episodes of low blood sugars have you?

PATIENT X319
No.

DOCTOR X319
No low.

PATIENT X319
No I haven't, no.

DOCTOR X319
Okay.  What's the lowest reading you had would you say?  @@@?

PATIENT X319
Yeah I think on that, I was under 100 yeah.

DOCTOR X319
Under 100 okay.

PATIENT X319
87.

DOCTOR X319
80s okay but nothing like low 60s.

PATIENT X319
No, no, nothing like that.

DOCTOR X319
Nothing like that okay.  Let me have you lay back here.  I'm going to push on your belly a little bit.  No pain there?

PATIENT X319
No.

DOCTOR X319
Sit you back up.  Go ahead and have a seat back over here.  Just looking to see if there are bulges in here and I just want to make sure, yeah @@@.  Did they do an EKG when you were in there?

PATIENT X319
They did.

DOCTOR X319
Let me look at that real quick.  I'm going to go chat with one of the attending doctors here.

PATIENT X319
Okay.

DOCTOR X319
And we'll come up with a plan for you okay.

PATIENT X319
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:20  DOCTOR IN:  48:50)

DOCTOR X319
So when you urinate do you feel like you're totally emptying when you do go?

PATIENT X319
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X319
Okay, so it doesn't feel like it's a prostate problem.  Cause I didn't know if you were feeling like you're fully emptying it.

PATIENT X319
No I have no problem area.

DOCTOR X319
Do you see the urologist here?

PATIENT X319
Yes I do yeah.

DOCTOR X319
And your prostate level is going up.  I know that you've had biopsies and all that before so I'll just let them follow up with that.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
When you see them the next time.  Um so I think two things I want to do today.  They didn't do a urine sample?  Did they do a urine sample on you?

PATIENT X319
No they didn't do that.

DOCTOR X319
So I think just because, I don't think you have a urinary tract infection but urinary infections can cause you to go to the bathroom a lot.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
So I think you should go down to the Lab and just give a urine sample and make sure you don't have infection.

PATIENT X319
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X319
That's causing it.  Um and then otherwise I think it's probably likely due to the sugars so we're going to start going up, you're taking 5 of glipizide in the morning only, we're going to start take 5 in the morning and 5 at night.

PATIENT X319
Okay.

DOCTOR X319
You keep track and see where your sugars are you know and kind of keep track of them and a couple weeks of doing that if you're still going a lot, urinating real frequently and having higher, I want to have you actually call in and talk to the nurse and kind of let her know what you've been doing.

PATIENT X319
Right, right.

DOCTOR X319
Um and then if that's still high we still have some room and we can go up a little bit more.

PATIENT X319
Okay.

DOCTOR X319
On the medication but we'll start, you kind of go slowly up with this cause you can have low blood sugars if you go up too fast.

PATIENT X319
I see.

DOCTOR X319
We'll go up to 5 now in the morning and 5 at night.

PATIENT X319
Uh just when I go to bed?

DOCTOR X319
Yeah, evening.

PATIENT X319
Evening yeah.

DOCTOR X319
You know whenever you take your pills.

PATIENT X319
Oh okay yeah.

DOCTOR X319
That would be before you go to bed; it can be you know whenever.

PATIENT X319
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X319
Sometime when you feel on schedule anyway.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
And then stop down to the Lab today and get a urine @@@.

PATIENT X319
Okay.

DOCTOR X319
And if there is an infection I'll call you and we'll put you on antibiotics.

PATIENT X319
Right.

DOCTOR X319
But @@@ if it's not.

PATIENT X319
Right, yeah.

DOCTOR X319
Medicine.

PATIENT X319
Okay.  Um, how do I get a pair of diabetic shoes?

DOCTOR X319
Oh diabetic shoes?

PATIENT X319
I have them at home but I've had them for two years and they're worn down in the back.

DOCTOR X319
Sure.

PATIENT X319
You know so, the heels, I don't wear them anymore.

DOCTOR X319
So, let's see.  You got them through the VA?  Did you get them through the VA before, the shoes?

PATIENT X319
No I paid for myself.  I got it from uh Medicare.

DOCTOR X319
Medicare.

PATIENT X319
Yeah.

DOCTOR X319
I could send you to the Prosthetics Division here that.

PATIENT X319
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X319
Let me put it in and just check your medications.  Also if you have anymore of those episodes where you have the real fast heartbeat, let us know that.

PATIENT X319
Okay.

DOCTOR X319
And keep on the fluids you know.  Stop down today and get that and the medications, I changed it in here but you have the same pills.  You can just take them and you should get more.

PATIENT X319
Okay.

DOCTOR X319
I'll do the refills.  Uh and then I'll follow up with you if you need to be put on antibiotics or something.

PATIENT X319
Okay.

DOCTOR X319
And then I think you are scheduled like to come back before, I recall in a year, in April.

PATIENT X319
April yeah.

DOCTOR X319
They will set you back up, we can have you follow up in one year, I'll have you set up and make sure you're up-to-date on everything okay.

PATIENT X319
Okay. Yeah.

DOCTOR X319
I'll walk you out here.

PATIENT X319
Okay.  Oh uh Prosthetics, do I need to see them?

DOCTOR X319
No they'll have to call you.  I put in a consult.

PATIENT X319
Oh.

DOCTOR X319
So they'll probably call you.

PATIENT X319
Oh good.

DOCTOR X319
To schedule that yeah.

PATIENT X319
Yeah.

DOCTOR X319
I think he is already scheduled to see me again in April, so a recall in April so you can just follow up with that schedule.

PATIENT X319
Okay thank you doctor.

DOCTOR X319

PATIENT X319
Uh I will yeah okay.

So across the way um, let's see.  So we haven't checked your prostate labs.

PATIENT X643
Did they put that in?

DOCTOR X643
Oh because of Pakistan.

PATIENT X643
Because of right.  Once I got done @@@.  I only understand a few words.  A little @@@, a year ago.

DOCTOR X643
Oh @@@.  Alright um and you were smoking a pack a day roughly before 2004.  Okay and how are you feeling now?

PATIENT X643
Hmm, just a little sleepy.

DOCTOR X643
Sleepy okay.  But um any chest pain, shortness of breath, um feeling like your heart's racing, fevers, chills, losing weight, @@@, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, swelling of your legs?

PATIENT X643
No.

DOCTOR X643
Numbness, tingling, double vision.

PATIENT X643
Insomnia, you said sleeplessness, which is probably from the CPAP.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.  Do you need a mask or do you feel like.

PATIENT X643
I don't, I've been doing okay.  Sometimes I get sleepy during driving and sleeping when I settle down.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.

PATIENT X643
As long as I'm busy I'm alright.

DOCTOR X643
But you, sometimes you do feel like when you're driving you get a little tired.

PATIENT X643
Right.  Well I mean, ever since I can remember I especially when driving.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.  Anything run in your family?

PATIENT X643
Anything what?

DOCTOR X643
Any illnesses run in your family that you know of?

PATIENT X643
No.

DOCTOR X643
And any allergies to medications?

PATIENT X643
Uh just anesthetics.

DOCTOR X643
What happens when you take those?

PATIENT X643
Uh I can't keep still.

DOCTOR X643
Oh okay.

PATIENT X643
It's like it sends my system into shock or something.

DOCTOR X643
Sure.  Okay um.

PATIENT X643
Which I think is good.  With anyone having problems with drugs, I've known better than to even try it though.  It's, I guess that's been a good thing.

DOCTOR X643
I think it is.  You finished your antibiotics um.  Your diabetes numbers actually look okay.  Kidneys look, your kidney numbers look a little high.  Were you not eating or drinking so well?  You know when you first had gone to the Emergency Room?

PATIENT X643
I probably wasn't drinking that much.

DOCTOR X643
Yeah.  Yeah.  (Doctor answers a page)  Sorry, @@@ um so it looks like your cholesterol's a little high.  I think uh you know we could try to control that with diet and exercise but um.

PATIENT X643
I've been eating too much @@@.

DOCTOR X643
But you know it's uh, it's something to you know think about if um you know, get you started with some medication, one pill that you would take at nighttime that would help bring your cholesterol down.  You don't have any liver disease which is good.  Um and I think let's see, because your last numbers looked good alright and you had an eye exam right in January.

PATIENT X643
Uh-huh, I got glasses.

DOCTOR X643
Okay good.  Let me take a quick listen to you.  Take a deep breath.  Take one more then and again.  Breathe normally, just regular breathing.  Anything painful at all?

PATIENT X643
No.

DOCTOR X643
Okay, alright.  Okay.  You haven't noticed a bunch of swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X643
No.  @@@.

DOCTOR X643
Yeah.  Take off your glasses for one second and straight ahead at me.  Say ah.

PATIENT X643
Ah.

DOCTOR X643
Good.  Now do you have a tooth that's been hurting?

PATIENT X643
Yeah.  That one, it was uh, it had a ceramic filling.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.

PATIENT X643
And it came out.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.

PATIENT X643
But I'm scheduled for; I think it's to check everything.

DOCTOR X643
Dental appointment okay.  Um we should maybe give you like a topical or something that would help the pain.  You know like an Orajel like a cream or something.

PATIENT X643
Good.

DOCTOR X643
That might help.

PATIENT X643
Good.

DOCTOR X643
Swallow, no lumps or bumps anywhere?

PATIENT X643
No.

DOCTOR X643
Alright.  Um I'm gonna run this by DOCTOR my attending and we'll see what we can do for you.  But um, when do you think the last time you took your blood pressure medicine was?

PATIENT X643
Uh probably, that was on the 8th, started the 4th.

DOCTOR X643
The 4th okay.

PATIENT X643
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X643
@@@ okay and your diabetes @@@.

PATIENT X643
Yeah.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.

PATIENT X643
Yeah.

(DOCTOR OUT:  21:32  DOCTOR IN:  27:10)

DOCTOR X643
Alright sir, okay.  So um okay um a couple of things we're gonna do.  We're gonna start you back on your home meds okay on the diabetes and for the blood pressure.

PATIENT X643
Yeah, I'm doing everything.

DOCTOR X643
Right.  So go ahead and start taking them because your blood pressure is still too high so we need you to come in two weeks for your blood pressure check.  You don't have to see me, you can just see the nurse and they can check it really quick and uh you know uh let us know.  At that time, you know if we want to @@@ since your medications but there's sort of no point if you haven't taken it for a while.

PATIENT X643
Right.

DOCTOR X643
We don't even know if what you're taking is working.  Um there are a couple other things, let's see, okay.  So we're doing this, we need your blood pressure; we'll get you a tetanus shot.  That's just the one that when you like brush up against metal or something like that, like rusty metal you can get tetanus from that so it's a shot you get once every ten years, it's uh and yeah that is not bad.

PATIENT X643
No side effects?

DOCTOR X643
No usually it's just the arm soreness.  And many times there's actually, you know they would prefer @@@.  Some people find that, I'm sure you've had other vaccinations in the past at some time but it usually doesn't prevent @@@ them.  Um then um we're gonna get you an ultrasound of your abdomen.  I know they had done some pictures before but um we'll send this back to xxx for part of your blood tests, so they'll start going to a clinic if you have.  And since you were using tobacco you're at increased risk of having what they call an aneurysm which mean that the blood vessel is big so for all men who are over 65 who have a smoking history, you know it's for pregnant women they do the same thing, they just put goop on your belly and it doesn't hurt.

PATIENT X643
Hmm.

DOCTOR X643
I think you should get that.  Um so um @@@.  We'll get your tetanus shot.  For your tooth, I think I'm going to try some, it's a topical thing that we give, I think it's just the thing that you kind of put in your mouth and swish around like a mouthwash and you spit it out.  (Doctor makes phone call)  Okay we're gonna start you on a low dose cholesterol medication.  The fact that you're a diabetic and you have high blood pressure means you should be on a cholesterol medication and a baby aspirin.

PATIENT X643
Okay.

DOCTOR X643
So we can address that.

PATIENT X643
I've got I think its 8 grams or 8 mm.

DOCTOR X643
81.

PATIENT X643
Yeah, I've got that.

DOCTOR X643
Uh-huh.  And would like to pick up this medication here?  Well I guess you've never been seen @@@, so you should pick it up here right?

PATIENT X643
Yeah.

DOCTOR X643
Good.

PATIENT X643
They could mail them; no they can mail it out.

DOCTOR X643
Oh does that work?

PATIENT X643
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.  (Doctor continues phone call)  What other reaction have you had?  It has listed an allergy that you have had a reaction to anesthetics, what happens?

PATIENT X643
Only, the only one that really bothers me has been Naproxen.

DOCTOR X643
(Doctor continues phone call)  Okay I think we should be okay.

PATIENT X643
Yeah and the only thing that bothers me is.

DOCTOR X643
(Doctor continues phone call)  So I think we'll just try that, it's like a mouthwash to rinse, we'll do that okay.  So um take your medications, come back in two weeks, you'll get your tetanus shot today um and then we'll check you in a few months.

PATIENT X643
Okay great.

DOCTOR X643
Does that sound good?  And you'll see me back in like six months.

PATIENT X643
Okay.

DOCTOR X643
Sounds like a plan?  Um let's see.  Oh I have these prescriptions up here, do you want me to mail them to you or do you want to wait?

PATIENT X643
They can mail them.

DOCTOR X643
Okay.  So the shot you have to get here.

PATIENT X643
Okay.

DOCTOR X643
The shot is the tetanus.

PATIENT X643
Yeah.  The um.

DOCTOR X643
Right.  

PATIENT X643
Okay.  

DOCTOR X643
Cause.

PATIENT X643
Good observation.  They'll do that today here?

DOCTOR X643
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X643
I can't remember that name of that local anesthesia they gave me.

DOCTOR X643
That's okay.  It should be alright.  Well you know I mean it's just a mouthwash.  Just try a little bit.  If you weird don't take it, you know.

PATIENT X643
No I'll be okay.

DOCTOR X643
And uh I'll give you this so.  Okay.

PATIENT X643
Okay good.

DOCTOR X643
And then.

PATIENT X643
Okay am I free to go pee.

DOCTOR X643
You're free to go pee um and um we'll schedule your colonoscopy, they'll call you for that.

PATIENT X643
Okay good.

DOCTOR X643
Let me just make sure I get those scheduled.  Alright.

PATIENT X643
Alright, thank you.

DOCTOR X643
Here you go sir.

PATIENT X643
Okay.

DOCTOR X643

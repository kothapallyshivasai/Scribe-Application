I only sleep about four hours.

DOCTOR X507
Are you using your oxygen at night?

PATIENT X507
Anytime I do it doesn't help me @@@ but then they told me to do the uh the distilled water, you know what I mean but we've been out of it.  Uh that didn't help either for my nose and my nose is very dry.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
They came to find out it is what it is.  It's been about seven, eight, ten years ago.  There was a little lump in here.  They took it out @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X507
But what is it, blood clot or something, why does it stop me from breathing.  Why can't they find that out?  Is it on my lungs; is there something wrong with my lungs or what?

DOCTOR X507
Hmm.  Um.

PATIENT X507
And uh, and another thing and another thing the last time I was here, I went over to the urologist.  @@@ you told me for a CAT scan and never got nothing out of it.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
And uh I'd like to take uh @@@ what is it, sometimes I feel like a little pain in here you know, it's coming down from the heart, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X507
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT X507
So I don't know uh so @@@ and find out what it is @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Like do an EKG, the EKG you mean?

PATIENT X507
Yeah.

DOCTOR X507
Oh.

PATIENT X507
What you talked about yea.  I want to find out @@@ the blood @@@ okay.  Is the heart working out okay.  I need to know.  I told them to find out or get some kind of a test you know when they took the biopsy of the kidney, see if that kidney function or something.  But this time I'm falling apart.  I usually be able to walk and I'm doing exercise.  Now I can't do it, I just can't breathe now.  I'm coughing like crazy.

DOCTOR X507
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X507
So what's causing that, what it is then.

DOCTOR X507
Well okay, so let's focus on one thing at a time.

PATIENT X507

DOCTOR X507
Tiotropium?

PATIENT X507
No it's uh something a little @@@ you squeeze it and you drink on it, it's like uh.  Oh God, @@@ and they said it was one of the side effects.  Cause a couple of times it made me sick as a dog.

DOCTOR X507

As long as you're not having like you know like a lot of pain, blood in your urine, anything like that.

Okay so then just wait until the CT scan.  

PATIENT X507
Okay.

DOCTOR X507
If you have any then tell me about this.

PATIENT X507

DOCTOR X507
Then I don't see why it's really that big of a deal.

PATIENT X507
Alright.

DOCTOR X507

PATIENT X507
No it doesn't really bother me but the thing is, I want to see if the kidney is functioning okay.

DOCTOR X507

DOCTOR X507
Okay uh let's see Pulmonology.

PATIENT X507
When the doctors talked to me, @@@ I actually want to find out why I can't, why my breathing is so bad.

DOCTOR X507
Well I saw his note, what they wrote in the computer.

PATIENT X507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X507
Um let's see if they can see you on the same day so you can do it on the same day as the CAT scan.  @@@ yeah @@@.  Uh so they evaluated you for the breathing okay.

PATIENT X507
Yes.

DOCTOR X507
Um.

PATIENT X507
Well one time @@@ try to find out @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X507
And then to say.

DOCTOR X507
It was not complete.

PATIENT X507
It was not complete and they had trouble with @@@.

DOCTOR X507
So they said that um.

PATIENT X507
Because I didn't do nothing.  All I knew is that it come back @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah well they said that they couldn't see it.  And sometimes that happens with studies, they're just not, you know it doesn't happen properly for whatever reason.

PATIENT X507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X507
So but uh you were welcome to repeat the studies so they said that they think that you were having maybe some decrease of oxygen at bedtime.

PATIENT X507
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X507
And that's why they wanted you to just keep the oxygen on at nighttime and they said that might help with your sleeping.  Has that happened or?

PATIENT X507
No it, I did sleep from 9 o'clock, 9 o'clock in the evening till the morning 7 or 8 o'clock, I do have the oxygen.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
And I do it.

DOCTOR X507
But you're still not sleeping well?

PATIENT X507
No.

DOCTOR X507
You're not sleeping.

PATIENT X507
No.  I @@@ four hours.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
One day I had one hour of sleep.

DOCTOR X507
Why are you waking up is it because you have to urinate or?

PATIENT X507
No I usually @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Okay um.

PATIENT X507
It's not that I @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Are there problems with sinuses or problems @@@.

PATIENT X507
Well normally I wake up and then like after three or four hours I wake up.

DOCTOR X507
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X507
And you know all of a sudden that's it, I'm awake.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X507
I try to stay in bed you know so I can sleep some more.

DOCTOR X507
So do you wake up, uh does anyone sleep around or, do they say you snore?

PATIENT X507
No, no, @@@.

DOCTOR X507
@@@.

PATIENT X507
No I don't snore, not that I know.

DOCTOR X507
No one's every told you you snore.

PATIENT X507
Yeah, yeah, I don't snore.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.  @@@ sleeping test, I don't know what else to tell you.

PATIENT X507
Okay @@@ cause this is a lung problem.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah.

PATIENT X507
Can they take uh x-ray of my lungs and see what it is?

DOCTOR X507
Well you can't tell from an x-ray.  They did do an x-ray.  They did an x-ray back about a year ago we did an x-ray and it was normal.  The only thing that you have is the emphysema which we already know.

PATIENT X507
Emphysema is what, it's in the lungs right?

DOCTOR X507
It's like a disease from smoking that you get in your lungs.

PATIENT X507
And @@@ right.

DOCTOR X507
It means that your lungs are kind of stretched out.  It just happens from smoking.  Cause that's why you take all these inhalers, that's for emphysema.

PATIENT X507
Oh, that's @@@ in other words, what will it get better or stay?

DOCTOR X507
It doesn't go away once you have it.

PATIENT X507
Doesn't go away.

DOCTOR X507
What we do is just treat it.

PATIENT X507
Treat it.

DOCTOR X507
With just using the inhalers that's it.  But that didn't cause you from having problems with sleeping.

PATIENT X507
I understand but it's different.

DOCTOR X507
So that's a different problem.

PATIENT X507
Well.

DOCTOR X507
So what we need to do.

PATIENT X507
The other thing I have is I feel sleepy now.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah.

PATIENT X507
So it's for a lack of oxygen I have.

DOCTOR X507
Yes.

PATIENT X507
And that's what causes.

DOCTOR X507
Yes.  

PATIENT X507
Okay.

DOCTOR X507
But you know you're using the oxygen and you're not, it's not any better right?

PATIENT X507
Now you also told me.

DOCTOR X507
But are you using the oxygen @@@.

PATIENT X507
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X507
@@@.

PATIENT X507
No.

DOCTOR X507
So then the only other thing is to do the sleep study again and watch, they monitor your oxygen, they monitor your breathing, everything.

PATIENT X507
And you say I should go back.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah it completely states that there's nothing @@@.

PATIENT X507
No I understand that.

DOCTOR X507
You know, but it's important @@@.

PATIENT X507
Okay, okay.  If you want me to I'll do it.

DOCTOR X507
Well if you, you know you can't sleep so you need to know why and the best way is to come up and do a sleep study so.

PATIENT X507
Oh.

DOCTOR X507
You know it's not like a harmful study you know.  It's just that you @@@.

PATIENT X507
But I think, I don't know if it was overnight.

DOCTOR X507
Overnight yeah.

PATIENT X507
Yeah overnight.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah.

PATIENT X507
Okay.

DOCTOR X507
So.

PATIENT X507
That's what I did the last time on it.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah.

PATIENT X507
So they're not going to know the results.

DOCTOR X507
There was something wrong with it and so they'll have to do it over.  That happens also unfortunately sometimes the studies, you don't get the information they want.

PATIENT X507
Now what about, how can they check my heart see if it's about blood @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Why don't we @@@.

PATIENT X507
Cause I do get a pain once in a while.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
And I got to reach in and grab an aspirin.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
That's what they say if you're gonna have a heart attack.

DOCTOR X507
Okay when does this pain come?

PATIENT X507
Uh when @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Like what are you doing?  Are you just sitting there or?

PATIENT X507
Oh once.

DOCTOR X507
Walking or?

PATIENT X507
No not when I'm walking.  It's when I'm sitting sometimes then you know when I watch TV.

DOCTOR X507
Uh-huh yeah.

PATIENT X507
Or uh.

DOCTOR X507
So just sitting.

PATIENT X507
Yeah.

DOCTOR X507
Do you feel short of breath when you get this pain?

PATIENT X507
Oh yes, yeah.

DOCTOR X507
But you get the pain then you feel like you can't breathe?

PATIENT X507
Right.  @@@ can't breathe @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Do you feel sweaty and your jaw hurts?

PATIENT X507
No.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
@@@.

DOCTOR X507
If you want to do an EKG we can do an EKG and we'll know in a second, look at it you know and see.

PATIENT X507
Well.

DOCTOR X507
If there's anything abnormal.

PATIENT X507
If it is will it show on it or can they do it here or @@@ do I set it up?

DOCTOR X507
Oh your angiogram.

PATIENT X507
And that.

DOCTOR X507
Well they aren't get an angiogram just for once in a while chest pain.

PATIENT X507
I understand that.

DOCTOR X507
@@@.

PATIENT X507
When do they do an angiogram to find out?

DOCTOR X507
If they do an angiogram, we check your heart if you having chest pain or if you do a stress test and it comes back abnormal they would do an angiogram.  If you're having really bad chest pain and it's very likely you're having a heart attack.  But if it's just once in a while when you're sitting watching TV that's not necessarily a bad @@@.

PATIENT X507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X507
Um but if you have chest pain very often or say you're walking and you have chest pain and @@@ that's a more serious type of chest pain.

PATIENT X507
So that's.

DOCTOR X507
Then we're going to do an angiogram for that so.

PATIENT X507
What do you recommend?  Is there one that @@@ clean out the arteries what is it just one artery?

DOCTOR X507
No.

PATIENT X507
@@@.

DOCTOR X507
You have to do a stress test and look inside or you can look inside.  They aren't going to just do an angiogram unless there's some real concern to find it.

PATIENT X507
Okay.

DOCTOR X507
Um and like I said you have to have really bad chest pain or you have to have an abnormal stress test.

PATIENT X507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X507
If you really want a stress test, you can get a stress test and we can see if you know @@@ something is going on with your heart.

PATIENT X507
I don't know if the stress test @@@.

DOCTOR X507
If you feel tired you know when you're walking and things like that.

PATIENT X507
Yeah, right, right.

DOCTOR X507
Anything like that.

PATIENT X507
If I'm walking yeah.

DOCTOR X507
Okay so an EKG and we can get a stress test if you want.  Have you ever had a stress test before?

PATIENT X507
Uh stress test, not here.  I had a stress test.

DOCTOR X507
Long time ago?

PATIENT X507
Yeah.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
A couple of times.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
Like before, when I had, with my other doctor and I @@@.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
@@@.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
And I had it at St. xxx's over here @@@ hospital you know.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.  Can you walk on the treadmill?  Probably not, do you get too tired?

PATIENT X507
I don't, I get tired when I'm walking you know from the parking lot.

DOCTOR X507
Yeah.

PATIENT X507
To the, like maybe 100 feet or something.

DOCTOR X507
Okay.

PATIENT X507
Now a treadmill, I might, I don't know how many steps or whatever you know but the people over there.  The last time there were four or five different specialists over there.  You know what I mean they're waiting for the, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X507
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X507
If anything happens then they @@@ are actually normal or uh.

DOCTOR X507
Okay so I just ordered a stress test for you.  

PATIENT X507
But before we do anything else, they'll probably do, @@@ run out of it right?

DOCTOR X507
What?

PATIENT X507
To clean out the artery.

DOCTOR X507
They're not going to do an angiogram.

PATIENT X507
No I understand that.

DOCTOR X507
They're gonna do a stress test to see if everything's normal.

DOCTOR X714
Does it say colchicine on the bottle?

PATIENT X714
Yes it does and I checked that real good.

DOCTOR X714
Alright.

PATIENT X714
And then it had like a rosy purple colored pill and that's it.

DOCTOR X714
Okay.  Alright.  So yeah you'll get your medicines in the mail and then you have, how much of the nifedipine do you have?

PATIENT X714
Uh I have like a month's supply.

DOCTOR X714
Okay so what you need to do is um, if you increase it to 90 and you have hmm oh maybe you could pick up the 90 mg pill at the window before you go.

PATIENT X714
Or I could split the other one and take a half pill.

DOCTOR X714
Uh but the thing is you have 60 right?

PATIENT X714
Yes.

DOCTOR X714
Well then if you have half.

PATIENT X714
That would be 30.

DOCTOR X714
Yeah, cut that in half.

PATIENT X714
Then it'd be 30.

DOCTOR X714
And then you'd take 1 1/2 tablets.

PATIENT X714
Yeah 1 1/2.

DOCTOR X714
Why don't you do that okay and then the 90s are the ones that will arrive in the mail.

PATIENT X714
Okay.

DOCTOR X714

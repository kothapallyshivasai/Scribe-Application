DOCTOR X52
I don't see Coumadin on your medication list.  It's also called Warfarin.

PATIENT X52
Yeah.

DOCTOR X52
Do you take that?

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
You're getting it here?

PATIENT X52

DOCTOR X52
I don't think you take that cause you're not on @@@.

PATIENT X52
Oh they probably taken it off then, they probably take me off it.  I was taking it.

DOCTOR X52
Yeah.  In the past you were but now you're off.

PATIENT X52
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
Okay.

PATIENT X52
I don't feel sick with this.  I @@@ cough @@@.

DOCTOR X52
So it was mainly the coughing and the shortness of breath?

PATIENT X52
Yeah that's all.  I was sore on both sides.

DOCTOR X52
Are you smoking?

PATIENT X52
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X52
When did you quit?

PATIENT X52
Oh, about two years ago.

DOCTOR X52
How much did you smoke then?

PATIENT X52
About a pack and a half a day.

DOCTOR X52
For how long?

PATIENT X52
Oh, man all my life, since I was about 10 years.  I'm 82 now.

DOCTOR X52
Well they checked your lungs for emphysema in 2006 and it looks like you had emphysema.

PATIENT X52
Oh I did.

DOCTOR X52
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT X52
They didn't tell me.

DOCTOR X52
I think what we're seeing a little bit now is emphysema.

PATIENT X52
Oh.

DOCTOR X52
Sounds like we gotta get you tuned up okay.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X52
You gotta get me tuned up?

DOCTOR X52
Yeah we're going to tune you up like a car, so we'll treat you better, I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X52
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:57  DOCTOR IN:  57:33)

DOCTOR X52
Okay.  I was talking to DOCTOR, he's my attending okay.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
And you have to; I think what's going on with you more than anything is what we call and exacerbation of emphysema.  We're gonna look at your lungs and see what the problem is if you have emphysema.  Do you know what emphysema is?

PATIENT X52
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X52
Emphysema is when people who smoke all their life, even though you quit a couple years ago your lungs don't work as well and they start trapping air and you have a hard time getting air out.

PATIENT X52
Yeah.

DOCTOR X52
And um when you start having productive sputum like you're having with shortness of breath you can get an exacerbation of COPD and I think that's what we're seeing with you.

PATIENT X52
Hmm.

DOCTOR X52
Okay.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
So this @@@ treating that, number one when I listen to you I don't hear pneumonia but given that you've had a lot going on.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
I want you to get a chest x-ray on the way.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
When you go down Radiology will call you.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
I'm still going to give you it's for part of COPD exacerbations, 
what works well is I want to try giving antibiotics for five days.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
It's called azithromycin okay.  I'll also want to give you um, who gives you your medications at home?

PATIENT X52
I take them myself.

DOCTOR X52
Okay, so you're pretty good about your medications?

PATIENT X52
Oh yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X52
Okay so, the antibiotic is going to be and these will all be in the instructions, its two pills the first day and then one pill the next four days okay.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
The steroid is going to be similar, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to give you some steroids to decrease the inflammation in your lungs.

PATIENT X52
Hmm.

DOCTOR X52
Okay.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
This other stuff, have you ever been on steroids before?

PATIENT X52
No.

DOCTOR X52
Uh they always have side effects okay.  Usually in the short term there are not that many side effects.

PATIENT X52
No.

DOCTOR X52
But sometimes people can get a little anxious.

PATIENT X52
Your right.

DOCTOR X52
And can cause some confusion and it can cause your blood sugar to go higher.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
Okay.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
But it's gonna really help with your breathing I think.

PATIENT X52
That's good.

DOCTOR X52
It's a 9 day course where the first two days you take four pills, the next three days you take you know two pills, the next three days you take one pill.  It will all be on the instructions.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
You take all of them and taper off, does that make sense?

PATIENT X52
That makes sense.

DOCTOR X52
And then I'm gonna start you on inhalers.  And inhalers are to help you breathe better.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
And you take two puffs of this inhaler every six hours and it's to open up your breathing a little bit.

PATIENT X52
Yeah.

DOCTOR X52
So we're doing three medications, steroid, antibiotic and inhaler and you're getting a chest x-ray on the way out.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
You normally see DOCTOR.  He's your primary doctor.

PATIENT X52
Hmm.

DOCTOR X52
And I think it's time you see him again for follow-up.

PATIENT X52
Yeah.

DOCTOR X52
You've had problems like this in the past.  @@@ DOCTOR we need to have you back within three or four weeks okay.  Now if you home and you're not doing better, the fevers persist and your breathing becomes harder, you got to come back to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X52
Oh.

DOCTOR X52
Okay.  You can stop at the X-ray today okay.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh, okay.

DOCTOR X52
And the Pharmacy today to pick up all the medicines I'm putting through.  Probably get your x-rays first to give the Pharmacy time to fill the medications.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
And you'll take the steroids today, the antibiotic today and start using the inhalers today.

PATIENT X52
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X52
Okay?

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
Do you have questions for me?

PATIENT X52
No, no.  All the instructions will be on the bottle, I might forget.

DOCTOR X52
Yep and @@@ don't be shy to have your family help you out okay.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
Cause this is a lot of new medications.

PATIENT X52
Yeah.

DOCTOR X52
The steroid might make your blood sugars go higher so keep checking your blood sugars and if they get high you have to call us and let us know.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

DOCTOR X52
And DOCTOR @@@.  Just, I don't @@@ so I'll give you an appointment card.  DOCTOR @@@ doctor.

PATIENT X52
Yeah.

DOCTOR X52
And you can't burn out.

PATIENT X52

DOCTOR X52
You're gonna call me and let me know.  So you're going to @@@ and then @@@ stop on the x-rays on the first floor Radiology and the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X52
Okay.

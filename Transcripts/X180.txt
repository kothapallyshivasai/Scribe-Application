PATIENT X180
Well I snore.  My wife, that's why she sleeps in another bedroom.  I always have snored.

DOCTOR X180
It's a situation where it's a test that you do in the Pulmonary Lab; it doesn't take much, where they evaluate whether you have breathing troubles.  Uh you may not know it but this sleeping trouble puts a stress on the heart and it can hurt the @@@ from the heart and can @@@ hypertension and stuff.

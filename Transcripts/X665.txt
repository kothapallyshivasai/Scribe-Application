DOCTOR X665
Hi PATIENT.

PATIENT X665
Hello.

DOCTOR X665
I'm DOCTOR.  Nice to meet you.

PATIENT X665
Okay nice to meet you.  Oh your shoes look nice.

DOCTOR X665
Thank you.  How are you today?

PATIENT X665
I'm getting there.

DOCTOR X665
Good.  I know you usually see DOCTOR in the past but.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
He went over to xxx so he's no longer here.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
So um it looks like you follow with the urologist pretty regularly.

PATIENT X665
Yeah I do uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
And then you also have seen the endocrinologist in the past.

PATIENT X665
Yes.

DOCTOR X665
For the osteoporosis.  Okay.  Are you, you're just on the calcium and vitamin D for now?

PATIENT X665
Well I take the vitamin D and then I take a multiple vitamin also.

DOCTOR X665
Multivitamin too okay.  Um are you having any bone aches or pains?

PATIENT X665
I get aches in my legs.

DOCTOR X665
In your legs?

PATIENT X665
Yeah when I'm trying to sleep.  It happens mostly at night when I'm going to sleep or trying to go to sleep, it'll start over here, then goes over here.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.

PATIENT X665
And then it'll stop and it'll move over here and here and uh.

DOCTOR X665
Anything in your feet?  Any pain in your feet?

PATIENT X665
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah but it feels like toe was turning back.

DOCTOR X665
Oh that's not a good feeling.  How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X665
Been going on for let's say the better part of this year.

DOCTOR X665
For so over six months?

PATIENT X665
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Uh it only occurs at night?

PATIENT X665
Pretty much yeah.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Do you have any back pain?

PATIENT X665
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Um have you had issues with your back in the past?

PATIENT X665
No uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
No.  Let me see if there's been any imaging of you before cause sometimes what can happen is um if you have some nerves being pinched in your back then that can cause the pain and the numbness in your lower legs.

PATIENT X665
Oh really, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Yeah and sometimes that can happen the most when you're sleeping at night because of the way you lay supine on your back.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
So it looks like you've never really had imaging of your back before.  So I think it'd be worthwhile that we could start off with an x-ray if not an MRI of the back to see if you're having any nerves pressed against there.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Um do you take anything for pain?

PATIENT X665
No.

DOCTOR X665
Now are you still on the methadone?

PATIENT X665
No.

DOCTOR X665
Or you stopped a while ago huh?

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Alright.  Good, so now you're only, you're getting the Zoladex from the GU Clinic.

PATIENT X665
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Do you still take the Megace?

PATIENT X665
Yes.

DOCTOR X665
For the hot flashes okay.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
And is that helping you?

PATIENT X665
Yes it does.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  That's good, most people I ask they say it's not helping.

PATIENT X665
And you have to keep taking them and that's what I found out anyway so when I first started taking them I think it was, I don't know if it was last year or the year before last, I can't remember but anyway uh it didn't have an effect on me at first.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.

PATIENT X665
And then after about a week of taking them constantly all of a sudden I was having a rush of @@@.

DOCTOR X665
Okay well that's good.  Is your appetite good?

PATIENT X665
My what?

DOCTOR X665
Your appetite?

PATIENT X665
Oh my appetite.  Appetite's great.

DOCTOR X665
Yeah.  You're not losing weight or anything?

PATIENT X665
No.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.

PATIENT X665
No.

DOCTOR X665
Any fevers, chills or anything like that?

PATIENT X665
Um let's see now um I could say that you know I have chills but I uh, let's just say when it was real hot in July.

DOCTOR X665
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X665
So I can always put the air conditioner on in my house or my apartment for only a short period of time because when I leave it on too long I can get really cold.

DOCTOR X665
Really cold okay.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Alright.  Any other issues or concerns today?

PATIENT X665
No, uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Uh I was just looking back and DOCTOR's note I guess you had talked about constipation with him at some point.  Is that still an issue?

PATIENT X665
Uh it's uh, it starts and it stops you know just now and then.

DOCTOR X665
Do you take any stool softeners or anything like that?

PATIENT X665
Not anymore.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Did those help when you were on them?

PATIENT X665
They may have helped a little bit.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Um do you want them prescription for them renewed?

PATIENT X665
Yeah why not?

DOCTOR X665
So you're drinking water?

PATIENT X665
I drink plenty of water.

DOCTOR X665
Okay and do you have fiber in your diet?

PATIENT X665
I don't like that.

DOCTOR X665
A lot of grains?

PATIENT X665
Uh.

DOCTOR X665
Not really?

PATIENT X665
Not a whole lot, not a lot of the time.  Every once in a while I get a really good grain diet and I have it for dinner for about four or five days and then there won't be any more for a while.

DOCTOR X665
Oh.

PATIENT X665
Unless you count uh Cheerios.

DOCTOR X665
A little bit.  Um okay and how's your breathing?  You have it looks like very mild COPD.

PATIENT X665
Uh yeah, uh as long as I don't do too much hustling.  If I got to walk fast I try and take a few breaths because if I do I have to stop.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  How far can you walk on a flat surface?

PATIENT X665
How far can I walk?

DOCTOR X665
Yeah before you get short of breath?

PATIENT X665
Um I might be able to walk a mile or two.

DOCTOR X665
Okay and you don't have any issues?

PATIENT X665
No uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Any chest pain with that?

PATIENT X665
No, no.

DOCTOR X665
And you don't have any inhalers right now?

PATIENT X665
No uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
No have you ever used inhalers?

PATIENT X665
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Alright and I know DOCTOR had talked to you in the past about getting um a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X665
And I said no.

DOCTOR X665
@@@, you still don't want to do that okay.

PATIENT X665
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay any blood in your stool?

PATIENT X665
No uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Alright.  Um have you had a follow up with the endocrinologist at all?

PATIENT X665
I haven't seen.

DOCTOR X665
We need to order an echo.

PATIENT X665
I haven't seen Endo since @@@.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  So I'd like to see you back and see them cause you know the repeat DEXA scan that you did in May shows that you have osteoporosis.

PATIENT X665
Yeah.

DOCTOR X665
So I think we need to start you on something called Fosamax which is a pill that you take once a week.  Um it helps with the bones.

PATIENT X665
Okay that's fine.  

DOCTOR X665
Uh @@@.

PATIENT X665
I may have had something like that or similar to that uh when I uh had, when I had the appointments with Endo.

DOCTOR X665
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X665
Uh one doctor gave it to me and it lasted for a week and they stopped.  I came back the following week I think.  Oh no that's not true, that's not true but you take it once a week.

DOCTOR X665
Yeah.

PATIENT X665
Yeah so uh I can't remember how many pills it was.

DOCTOR X665
Was that for the vitamin D?

PATIENT X665
Huh?

DOCTOR X665
Was that for the vitamin D ergocalciferol?

PATIENT X665
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Yeah so you did that so that's the initial treatment we would do just to see if it's stoking up your vitamin D levels will help to kind of correct that osteoporosis.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
But that's why they tried you on that and that's the reason for the Fosamax I'm gonna give you.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Um but on the repeat DEXA scan it still shows that your numbers are still within the osteoporosis range.

PATIENT X665
Right, right.

DOCTOR X665
And at this point we would actually treat you for osteoporosis.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
With Fosamax, it's once a week and it's a little bit of a pain it's a medication you take only because you have to take it and you have to sit upright for 30 minutes.  You can still move around and stuff but you need to remain sitting upright cause one of the major risks with that medication is if it gets caught in your esophagus it can cause ulcerations in your esophagus.  Doesn't happen very often if you're taking it appropriately mainly you take it with plenty of water, you sit upright for 30 minutes and kind of let it go down in its own then you'll be fine.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
Um and so do you have any teeth, dental work that needs to be done.

PATIENT X665
Yes, yeah.

DOCTOR X665
You do.

PATIENT X665
Yes.  I start it, they need to finish.  I had started it uh before I found out that I had prostate cancer.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.

PATIENT X665
And they took out four teeth, they were starting this way and they were to come around here I think.

DOCTOR X665
So you have more teeth to be pulled?

PATIENT X665
Yeah, yeah, I have to go to them.

DOCTOR X665
Okay so that should be done first before you start the Fosamax because the other side effect with the Fosamax is, it's rare and it doesn't happen very often but when it does it can be pretty detrimental.  You can get necrosis of your jawbone.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Um but that only tends to happen when somebody's already been on the Fosamax for a while and then you go in and do you know extensive dental work which means you're pulling out multiple teeth.  It just gives you an increased risk for developing that.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
But that doesn't mean that you'll necessarily get it but there is a risk.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Um so if you have any dentists or the oral surgeons will say you know we need to have all of this stuff done first before we can put you on the medication.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
So what, are you going to be seeing the dentist soon to get the rest of the work done?

PATIENT X665
I haven't, yes I want to make an appointment but I recently went up to the eye doctors.

DOCTOR X665
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X665
And uh I tried to make an appointment there and when I talked to the person that I talked to they told me and I hadn't been there in two years so I needed to talk to my doctor and have him or her uh okay it.

DOCTOR X665
You have to get an appointment.

PATIENT X665
To get an appointment to go back to the Optical.

DOCTOR X665
Do you get it here?

PATIENT X665
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  That's weird cause usually we don't put in dental.  Oh let's see let me see if I can get into it cause typically I don't put in a dental consult.

PATIENT X665
Okay well but I was going to ask you about okaying an appointment for the eye doctor anyway cause I think it's time for me to change my prescription.

DOCTOR X665
The eye doctors.

PATIENT X665
Yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  It's the bottom teeth that need to be extracted?

PATIENT X665
No it's the top, all the top.

DOCTOR X665
Are you getting dentures?

PATIENT X665
I plan to yes.

DOCTOR X665
Oh okay.

PATIENT X665
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
And then you need an eye appointment you said.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Just for routine.

PATIENT X665
Routine check yeah.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.

PATIENT X665
And possible prescription change.

DOCTOR X665
And are you nearsighted or farsighted, your glasses for distance?

PATIENT X665
Uh I think probably farsighted.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Alright the other thing we need to do is update your labs.  It's been over a year so we need to check your cholesterol, your sugars, your kidney function and all of that stuff so um did you eat breakfast this morning?

PATIENT X665
No I didn't.

DOCTOR X665
Okay perfect.  Do you mind going to the Lab today?

PATIENT X665
Uh.

DOCTOR X665
It depends.

PATIENT X665
Uh now how long is that going to take?

DOCTOR X665
Not long, you don't need an appointment or anything.

PATIENT X665
Um okay.

DOCTOR X665
Do you need refills on your vitamins or anything like that?

PATIENT X665
No they're okay, they're okay right now.

DOCTOR X665
@@@ okay.  Alright and you want your @@@ shot today?

PATIENT X665
Sure uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  You can just sit up there for me and I'll take a look right here.  Any smoking?

PATIENT X665
Yeah.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Have you thought about quitting?

PATIENT X665
Yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
What's stopping you?

PATIENT X665
What's stopping me?

DOCTOR X665
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X665
I don't know, I couldn't answer that question.  It's just something that I do.

DOCTOR X665
It's bad for you.  Are you interested in quitting?

PATIENT X665
Well I'm working on it because see I used to drink and smoke more than a pack a day and then so now I'm down to about a half a pack so.

DOCTOR X665
You're still @@@ then?

PATIENT X665
Yeah.

DOCTOR X665
Have you ever tried the gum or lozenges?

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Doesn't work for you?

PATIENT X665
Uh I especially don't like the lozenges because it takes them too long to dissolve.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.

PATIENT X665
And I'd like hold them under my tongue.

DOCTOR X665
Oh I see okay.  Well the reason why I'm really pushing for it is because it doesn't help with your osteoporosis, two it's really bad for your lungs since you already have this mild COPD, it just makes it worse.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Over the years and it looks like you're at risk for other type of cancer since you already have prostate cancer but it could put you at risk for other types um and it puts you at increased risk for heart disease and it's bad all the way around and you're @@@ so.  Right now you're doing well without any inhalers and you don't require anything but.

PATIENT X665
Yeah I know, it could happen.

DOCTOR X665
Yeah so you need some and you know if you get to the point where it's really bad COPD then you're having four or five inhalers that you need to take every single day.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
Can you take your glasses off for me?

PATIENT X665
Uh my what?

DOCTOR X665
Your glasses.

PATIENT X665
Glasses oh.

DOCTOR X665
Look straight at me.  Say ah.  Open up your mouth.  No weakness that you've noticed?

PATIENT X665
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
@@@ no okay.  Deep breaths.  You do have a little bit of wheezing in your lungs.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Any pain when I press on your back?

PATIENT X665
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Here?

PATIENT X665
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Let me have you actually lay down for me.  Hold on a second.  Alright I'm going to manipulate your legs a little bit here okay.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
I'm going to lift here, any pain?

PATIENT X665
No.
DOCTOR X665
Here?  Any pain?

PATIENT X665
No but I could feel that a little bit.

DOCTOR X665
A little bit.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Alright go ahead and sit up.  Alright give me just a minute; I'll put in your medicine.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
Thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  32:02  DOCTOR IN:  35:40)

DOCTOR X665
Alright.  Okay so what I would like for you to do is make an appointment with the Endocrinology doctors in about a month or so.

PATIENT X665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X665
You should also be able to see the dentist before then; do you think you'll be reaching them?

PATIENT X665
Sure I can go and make an appointment.  I can go up there and ask for an appointment today.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  So do that and come down here to see Endocrine in the next four to six weeks because I want you to have all that dental work done before you see them cause they're gonna start you on that Fosamax that I was taking about.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
So you should have that stuff done before you see them.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
So we'll get that here and then I'll have them make you an appointment with the Eye Clinic.  Yeah the other thing is um the back x-ray um I don't know if you'll have time to do it today.  You don't have to but um I can put the order in and you could get it done when you have time.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
Prior to the next appointment that you make.  I just want to see if you have any herniated disks or any narrowing in the disks that could possibly explain your lower extremity issue.  Okay and then you can come back and see me in about five or six months okay.  In the meantime you should see the endocrinologist @@@.

PATIENT X665
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR X665
Okay.  Sounds good, so they can get you these appointments up front at the reception.  Any other questions today?

PATIENT X665
Uh let's see, I think that's it.  I think I asked the questions that I wanted answered.  Um @@@.

DOCTOR X665
Yes.  Alright.

PATIENT X665
Okay.

DOCTOR X665
Okay no problem.  Don't forget your bag @@@.

PATIENT X665
See you.

DOCTOR X665
Bye bye.

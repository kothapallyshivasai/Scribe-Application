DOCTOR X443
PATIENT?  How you doing?

PATIENT X443
Good.  How you doing?

DOCTOR X443
Good.  Have a seat.  (Doctor takes a phone call)  Sorry about that um how's it going PATIENT?

PATIENT X443
Great.

DOCTOR X443
How you been doing?

PATIENT X443
Uh I been feeling okay uh I came yesterday and did my blood work and uh.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah I saw that here.

PATIENT X443
And there was probably one before that even uh and I didn't get uh, I missed my last appointment.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  How have you been doing otherwise?

PATIENT X443
Uh had really no issues except I'm very lethargic during the day and uh I've got so many meds that I'm taking now and I don't know if uh that has anything to do with it.

DOCTOR X443
Um what, how long has this lethargy been going on for you.  Has it been an ongoing thing?

PATIENT X443
Oh just say maybe six months.

DOCTOR X443
Six months and uh how are you, are you having to like go to sleep at night, I mean go to sleep are you taking naps every day or something?

PATIENT X443
Um yeah I kind of do that but uh I have a good night's sleep, I sometimes don't even get up at all.

DOCTOR X443
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X443
Um.

DOCTOR X443
And how many hours do you sleep typically?

PATIENT X443
Oh I would say about seven or eight.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
The um and I'm kind of depressed.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
It gets like everybody else.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Uh they do have me on; I don't know if it's on your screen, some antidepressants.

DOCTOR X443
Uh and it's helping?

PATIENT X443
Uh.

DOCTOR X443
Is it helping a little bit with this uh?

PATIENT X443
Yeah I think so a little bit.  I'm taking Wellbutrin.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
And um I also take Adderall three times a day.

DOCTOR X443
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X443
And even with Adderall you know I take an Adderall and go right to sleep.

DOCTOR X443
Really.

PATIENT X443
Yeah and it should be the opposite.

DOCTOR X443
How many times are you napping during the day?

PATIENT X443
Uh once or twice.  I'm on 100% disability so I don't have a job; just you know hobbies and things like that uh to stay busy.

DOCTOR X443
Right.  Uh.

PATIENT X443
I wonder if it could be that trazodone.  

DOCTOR X443
Trazodone?

PATIENT X443
Right.

DOCTOR X443
Well why are you taking the trazodone?

PATIENT X443
For sleep.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.  So I mean you take it at night right?

PATIENT X443
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X443
You're not taking it during the day cause that would.

PATIENT X443
No.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  Uh.

PATIENT X443
I wonder does that linger on, that's the only thing I could think that would make much of a difference.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.  Have you tried not taking the trazodone?  Are you able to sleep?

PATIENT X443
Uh.

DOCTOR X443
I mean without the trazodone in other words.

PATIENT X443
Sometimes I can.  I just kind of add it where I just did it; I just did it for um at night.  When I have trouble sleeping I get it and I get up in the middle of the night and take it so I don't take it every day.

DOCTOR X443
You don't take it every day.  Trazodone usually shouldn't linger at all throughout the next day.

PATIENT X443
Should not?

DOCTOR X443
Typically should not no um.

PATIENT X443
Do you have a list of my meds there?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Does anything stand out that might?

DOCTOR X443
Nothing stands out I mean sometimes some of the, I mean depression in itself can cause you know you being kind of fatigued.

PATIENT X443
Yeah.

DOCTOR X443
Are you not, do you just like you don't have any energy?  Uh when you wake up you feel refreshed and then a few hours later you feel like you have to go back to sleep?

PATIENT X443
Yeah because I have no reason to, it'd be different if uh like before I was treated for diabetes I might get up and urinate four, five times a night and.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
But I'm not doing that.

DOCTOR X443
You're not doing that.

PATIENT X443
But um like I said I get up and the only thing I want to do is lay down and I can't for the night to come to fall back asleep.

DOCTOR X443
Do you snore at night, do you know?  Has anybody ever told you you snore?

PATIENT X443
Uh I did have a sleep study here.

DOCTOR X443
Oh you did.

PATIENT X443
Yeah.

DOCTOR X443
You already had that?

PATIENT X443
Yeah and um.

DOCTOR X443
What did that tell you?

PATIENT X443
They gave me one of those masks to wear at night.

DOCTOR X443
Alright.

PATIENT X443
I have to admit I haven't been real religious uh with that.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
And one thing that bothered me, I'll be honest with you uh, I quit drinking about 2 1/2 years ago and in the last three months I started drinking again.

DOCTOR X443
You started drinking in the last three months?

PATIENT X443
Yeah after being abstinent for 2 1/2 years. 

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
It's just that I couldn't go to sleep and I needed, I had a couple shots of something or a couple glasses of wine that you know, that would always get me to sleep.

DOCTOR X443
So you restarted a month ago?

PATIENT X443
Right.

DOCTOR X443
So you were having trouble sleeping but yet your tired?  If you were tired you, so you're tired but you can't sleep during the night.

PATIENT X443
Right.  It seems like my mind races a lot.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
And um that kind of keeps me up.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
I know that Wellbutrin, that one antidepressant, would that have anything to do with being lethargic?

DOCTOR X443
Well some, I think sometimes the antidepressants can cause someone that, it's not necessarily typical but uh.

PATIENT X443
@@@.

DOCTOR X443
I'm sure it can cause @@@.

PATIENT X443
And I was taking the generic for Zoloft I believe.

DOCTOR X443
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X443
And my psychiatrist had me on Zoloft and Wellbutrin.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
And I didn't understand it because I thought you should just take one antidepressant or another.

DOCTOR X443
No sometimes you can take more than one.  That'd be a question for your psychiatrist if.

PATIENT X443
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X443
You have questions on the strategy.

PATIENT X443
Okay.

DOCTOR X443
But I mean it's not uncommon for people to be on.

PATIENT X443
You wouldn't believe it.  I was always such a neat person and I just turned into a slob and then if you went into my house you'd think there was a robber you know and then I'll spend three days making it as uh stark clean as a hospital room you know but I just you know I just can't get myself to do normal tasks you know.  I thought the Adderall would help with that too.

DOCTOR X443
It didn't.

PATIENT X443
Nope and uh I just let things go.  I eventually clean everything up at the end of the week but.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
You know that's out of character for me to be a slob like that.  I mean I even make my bed in the morning.

DOCTOR X443
Hmm.  You're on the Zoloft uh.

PATIENT X443
Well I stopped taking the Zoloft and I just took the Wellbutrin.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
Because I heard that could help you with staying more alert.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  Yeah the Zoloft can be, cause sleepiness and uh how much are you drinking right now?

PATIENT X443
I'd say about half a bottle of wine a day.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
Which I want to get myself back in the program because I haven't gone as far back as what I used to be like.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Uh but I know if you've been there before it would be.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.  Yeah I encourage you to try to quit. I mean you were doing good for 2 1/2 years, that's a long time.

PATIENT X443
It is.

DOCTOR X443
And uh yeah I would definitely encourage you to try to stop drinking again.

PATIENT X443
No I understand cause I've really been down in the dumps.

DOCTOR X443
Have you talked to your psychiatrist about this drinking?

PATIENT X443
Uh yeah I did and I have an appointment to see her next week.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
You know it's kind of funny, I could drink a whole bottle of wine and you wouldn't even know that I drank it.  I mean it has no affect.  I mean I don't get high.  I don't slur my words.  You know it's like it has zero affect on me.  I find that very odd.

DOCTOR X443
Well people have different tolerance levels you know.

PATIENT X443
Yeah especially after not drinking for 2 1/2 years.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Used to be I had two beers and I had a little buzz you know and I don't think I've been drunk for this entire time that I started drinking again.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.  Hmm.  How about your other medicines.  Are you still taking your other medications?  Your metformin and your blood pressure medications.

PATIENT X443
Yeah I didn't.  If you wanted to see I brought my Accu-Chek machine.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
To see what I've been doing and also I brought in the blood pressure machine cause that keeps track of.

DOCTOR X443
So you're taking your lisinopril now and uh you're taking lisinopril and is that the only one now?

PATIENT X443
Yeah the one I take is the lisinopril, metoprolol and.

DOCTOR X443
Are you taking the metoprolol?

PATIENT X443
Yeah.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
Is that a good idea?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah, no you should be taking the metoprolol.  

PATIENT X443
These are uh, some @@@ I usually test every other day.  

DOCTOR X443
Is this for blood pressure @@@.  So you take these after you take your blood pressure medicines usually or?

PATIENT X443
Sometimes before, sometimes after.  And I've really become introverted as far as not wanting to go out or see my friends or do anything and I just stay home you know and I read a lot and watch the Movie Channel all the time and I never even go out of the house.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah it looks like you've been on medications.

PATIENT X443
Yeah and it's got increasingly worse.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
And I know that Adderall is a form of amphetamines, isn't that right doctor?

DOCTOR X443
Uh yeah.

PATIENT X443
And historically that would uh make you more alert and another thing focus.

DOCTOR X443
It should yeah.  Now your sugars when you check them are they in the morning usually?

PATIENT X443
Yeah in the mornings.  See I'm all over the place with that.

DOCTOR X443
It looks like you've swung you know high sometimes, not very often.  Any uh episodes of really low sugars?

PATIENT X443
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X443
Where you've got to take food or something like that?

PATIENT X443
Yes where I've had to take sugar pills.

DOCTOR X443
When did you have, how many times has that happened?

PATIENT X443
Uh maybe about eight or nine times.

DOCTOR X443
Eight or nine times?

PATIENT X443
Yeah.

DOCTOR X443
In the morning?

PATIENT X443
Uh yes.  I feel uh, I even have to take like the sugar tablets.

DOCTOR X443
When does it happen in the morning when you check your sugar you have to help with this.

PATIENT X443
Yes in the morning or afternoon.

DOCTOR X443
Low uh how low?

PATIENT X443
Uh anywhere from 45 to 65.

DOCTOR X443
And are you; is this like first thing in the morning or typically when?

PATIENT X443
Typically in the morning.

DOCTOR X443
And do you skip dinner @@@.

PATIENT X443
Yeah I have very poor eating habits.  I eat at all different times.

DOCTOR X443
Okay that's gonna cause problems with the sugars being low okay.  You got to be careful about that okay.  If you're gonna skip dinner at night you should not take your metformin dose.

PATIENT X443
Okay.

DOCTOR X443
Alright cause if your sugars drop too low you could go into a diabetic coma.

PATIENT X443
Yeah I know that.  I'm very, you know concerned about that with @@@.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah you got to eat a regimented meal so breakfast, lunch and dinner.  You should eat like structured meals and don't skip meals to be in the safest.  Don't skip meals and eat your three meals a day.

PATIENT X443
Alright.

DOCTOR X443
Okay and if you're gonna, if you are gonna skip a meal then you should skip your metformin.

PATIENT X443
And another thing I noticed to worse uh is that my sex drive is like totally diminished.

DOCTOR X443
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X443
I don't know if that has to do with some of the meds I've been taking.

DOCTOR X443
It can uh sometimes the metoprolol can cause uh that but it could be to a wider.  You know diabetes and high blood pressure are uncontrolled for a long period of time it can cause that as well.

PATIENT X443
Do you see any places doctor where we could lower dosage or eliminate a med?

DOCTOR X443
Um.

PATIENT X443
Oh one thing they didn't renew on me which helped, not Flomax but like an equivalent to it, starts with a T and that really helped with me, uh with my bladder.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah the terazosin?

PATIENT X443
Yeah I don't know why they didn't renew it for me.

DOCTOR X443
I'll renew if for you.  Do you want it mailed to you or do you want to pick it up today?

PATIENT X443
They can mail it to me.  I think I've got a couple left.

DOCTOR X443
And the metoprolol, how much were you taking of the metoprolol?

PATIENT X443
Uh I think um one and a half a day.

DOCTOR X443
And you take an aspirin every day?

PATIENT X443
Yeah I just started that last month.  Now what's that fama?

DOCTOR X443
Which one?

PATIENT X443
It starts with a @@@ yeah what is that?

DOCTOR X443
That ones for the cholesterol.  But you're not.

PATIENT X443
I don't take it anymore.

DOCTOR X443
Right we had stopped taking that.  Your cholesterol looks fine you know just part of the blood work you got when you were here, uh this recent blood work.

PATIENT X443
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X443
And your cholesterol is fine.  In fact it's very low so.

PATIENT X443
And uh how does it look for my sugar?

DOCTOR X443
Uh how does it look oh for your sugar?

PATIENT X443
Right.

DOCTOR X443
Like I said your sugar looks okay.  Your sugar is in the 140s in the morning isn't bad.  Actually it's fairly good.  You have a couple that are a little higher but that's not too bad and since you're telling me you've had eight or nine episodes where your sugars have been in the 40s or 50s, I would not change your metformin probably um.  You're taking metformin 1000 once in the morning and once at night.  You know if you're having a lot of sugars that are low in the morning, I would tell you you could cut back on your evening metformin dose.  So if you don't eat dinner at all and lunch is the last meal of your day or you kind of, you don't eat dinner at all.

PATIENT X443
Yeah but sometimes I would get up in the middle of the night and eat something.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
You know.

DOCTOR X443
I mean I'd just be more cautious and more worried about the low sugars if you're having it eight or nine times.  So I would just tell you to cut down like 500 in the evening so take 1000 in the morning and then 500 at night.

PATIENT X443
Um how low uh should the sugar go before I should seek medical care?

DOCTOR X443
Well if you, if your sugar is like in the 40s and 50s.  Do you get shaky, nervous when you get the sugars low, sweaty?  If you get those symptoms just immediately you should eat something.

PATIENT X443
Yeah I bought those sucrose pills or whatever they are.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Um.

DOCTOR X443
I mean if it's happening repeatedly I would come in happening, you could either come into the ER or you could come in and make an Acute Care appointment over there at the Med Clinic and in Acute Care if you can't get an appointment with me in that short of time and just have your metformin adjusted and I would stop taking it until you see us that's all.

PATIENT X443
Okay you know what I'm gonna be more regimented as far as when I take my meds and eat my food.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Because uh.

DOCTOR X443
I think that's a good idea.

PATIENT X443
Even with my meds sometimes I fall asleep and I forget to take them at night and.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
And I miss uh.

DOCTOR X443
You miss medicines.

PATIENT X443
But is there anything else there you think could be uh eliminated or the dose cut down?

DOCTOR X443
Uh I'm going to give you more of the Levitra.  Do you want the Levitra for your?

PATIENT X443
Yeah that helps.

DOCTOR X443
And I'll give you that.  I'm gonna; I don't see your blood pressure today.  Did you take your blood pressure medicine today?

PATIENT X443
No.

DOCTOR X443
Okay your blood pressure is not where we'd like it to be you know.  I don't want to change it if you're taking your metoprolol and your lisinopril.  I think just cause you didn't take it today may reflect it.  It looks like your blood pressures at home actually aren't too bad. I mean you're still, sometimes you're at the goal and some of the pressures you have high.  It's hard to say whether.  Do you take most of your blood pressures, the majority would you say is before you take your blood pressure medicine or after?

PATIENT X443
Um well I take mostly all the blood pressure medicines at night and then I take my blood pressure reading in the morning.  I was taking all the blood pressure medicines at night because I had a lot of those cause they make you a little groggy.

DOCTOR X443
And you take metoprolol; you take one and a half?

PATIENT X443
Right.

DOCTOR X443
Twice a day?

PATIENT X443
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  Because you're taking the lisinopril uh I think those look pretty good.  I don't think we need to go up.  I don't think we can go down on it based on what I see here.  Um we may not actually need to go up on it either.

PATIENT X443
Yeah maybe the drinking's got something to do with it too.

DOCTOR X443
The drinking yeah, I would cut down the drinking for sure uh.  The CPAP machine.  I know it's hard to get to sleep with that and it's hard to be fully kind of compliant and religious with that but I think part of your grogginess during the day uh is gonna be related to your sleep apnea okay.  One of the, one of the ways we screen for sleep apnea is we ask people are you fatigued during the day, do you usually have to take frequent naps during the day?  Are you tired or lethargic during the day?  That's an indication that they have sleep, sometimes have sleep apnea.

PATIENT X443
Well I want to say I'll wear the mask you know.

DOCTOR X443
Well good because what's happening at night, at night what happens is your airway gets blocked by the way your airway.

PATIENT X443
Yeah it used to like wake me up you know.

DOCTOR X443
Right exactly.

PATIENT X443
But that doesn't happen anymore.

DOCTOR X443
Right it may not continue to happen but it doesn't mean that uh that the apnea is resolved.  So you're not getting good airway say so basically your sleep is actually not, you're not getting very good quality sleep.

PATIENT X443
And I have to take that.

DOCTOR X443
As a result and then yeah.  So I would use the CPAP and that may help as you use it every night.

PATIENT X443
Yeah cause I got to admit I hardly ever use it anymore.  I felt like I was in a fighter jet.

DOCTOR X443
I think that would help.  I think cutting down on alcohol would help and I think talking with your psychiatrist, maybe seeking some addiction counseling to help you maybe.  Cause you've done it before so it's just about getting you back to where you were and abstinent cause alcohol.

PATIENT X443
Well I could go back to AA.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Have you ever been to an AA meeting?

DOCTOR X443
I have not.

PATIENT X443
You know it's so depressing cause as you know they just go around the room and say I'm an alcoholic and then you just say whatever's on your mind and everybody's telling all these depressing stories I walk out of there and you know.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
And I know, that's why I stopped going to AA because you know I'll hear somebody yeah you know I was a drunk for 12 years and I haven't had a drink for three years and things are going good.  Who wants to hear stuff like that and one other person well this is the third time I tried to commit suicide.  This person says her boyfriend left and that's why she started drink.  It's all these depressing stories.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
And especially the women, they start crying and then they start rambling on.

DOCTOR X443
@@@ for you.  Well you could do maybe like more personal one on one counseling I guess, better, more suited for you.  Uh maybe AA doesn't.

PATIENT X443
Is that available over here?

DOCTOR X443
They do have addiction, yeah they have Addiction Psych here and they have, I believe they have addiction counseling or they refer you there.  The psychiatrist may know more than me about it.

PATIENT X443
Should I take that up with her?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah I mean they do.  We have Addiction consult here; do you want me to place it for you?

PATIENT X443
Uh.

DOCTOR X443
Would you like to have it, I mean would you be interested in?

PATIENT X443
I'm going to uh.

DOCTOR X443
Or would you like to talk to your psychiatrist first?

PATIENT X443
As long as I'm gonna see her next week I could run it by her but.

DOCTOR X443
Sure.

PATIENT X443
I think it would be a good idea.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  I'll, what I'll do is I'll put it in.

PATIENT X443
Okay.

DOCTOR X443
And then you talk to the psychiatrist about it next week and if she feels like uh there's another route then you can, then she can cancel this too.  Okay.

PATIENT X443
I'm all confused.  Like the psychiatrist I know that unlike going into therapy this and that they can prescribe medicine but are they also somebody that you should be able to talk to about what's going on?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.  What's going on with her yeah?

PATIENT X443
We really don't have uh many long conversations.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
About you know what's going on.

DOCTOR X443
Sure.

PATIENT X443
I mention it but.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
I feel like I'm you know taking up too much time sometimes.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  What's your phone number?

PATIENT X443
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X443
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X443
NUMBER.

DOCTOR X443
What about a psychologist, what if you see Psychology here?  Would you be interested in seeing Psychology maybe?

PATIENT X443
Well what do you think about that?

DOCTOR X443
I think that'd be helpful and in all honesty.  Cause it's something more where you can talk more about stuff that's going on.  Maybe we could refer you there.

PATIENT X443
Okay.

DOCTOR X443
I think more the help the better and as you, you know you might go to the doctor and go this is not for me and you could just you don't have to follow up or just say you know I'm not going to follow up in Psychology @@@.

PATIENT X443
Uh.

DOCTOR X443
But just uh you can go once and see how it is and if it.

PATIENT X443
All these places are at this hospital right?  It's kind of like an hour drive for me but I think maybe I should try Psychology.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  I'll put an order in for Psychology um.  Let me take a look and examine you real quick now.  Are you getting up?  Are you being active?  Are you going out walking or?

PATIENT X443
Well I walk the dog quite a bit.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.  It's important to stay active too cause that may help with some of that lethargy, just to do some light activity every day.

PATIENT X443
Yeah.  If you've noticed I think I've gained about 10 pounds since I was here.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.  That's definitely not going to help with uh.  Take a deep breath.  With you feeling tired you know.  If you gain weight you getting a little tired.  You know there may be more than one reason why you're tired sometimes you know so we've got to attack it as more than one way.

PATIENT X443
You know.

DOCTOR X443
Stop your drinking, using the CPAP.

PATIENT X443
Yeah I was thinking of another thing too I don't.

DOCTOR X443
Eating healthier, doing light exercise every day, that type of thing.

PATIENT X443
I don't drink you know coffee all day in fact I don't drink coffee at all.  But I would in the afternoon sometimes take No Doze which is 200 mg of caffeine.

DOCTOR X443
Right, right.

PATIENT X443
Cause that's like having a cup of coffee right?

DOCTOR X443
It is yeah similar. Um.

PATIENT X443
Is that a bad idea?

DOCTOR X443
No it's not a bad idea I mean the Adderall, it looks like there's a lot to this caffeine, Adderall, looks like kind of the usual amount of stuff to keep yourself awake but it's not necessarily a bad thing no um.  But yeah.

PATIENT X443
And uh but now I'm taking less of the lorazepam than I used to because I used to take it when I would have a panic attack or this or that.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Which when I usually reach for a drink but because I'm drinking sporadically.  You know I'll go like four days without even drinking.

DOCTOR X443
Right.

PATIENT X443
So it's not like it was before uh but lorazepam will make me feel lethargic.

DOCTOR X443
Lorazepam.

PATIENT X443
Am I right?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah, yeah and it's sedating and will make you.  It works on the same receptors that alcohol works on in the body so it's almost like alcohol.  In fact we'll give that medicine for people who are having alcohol withdrawals.

PATIENT X443
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X443
So.

PATIENT X443
So maybe.

DOCTOR X443
So stay off the lorazepam.

PATIENT X443
Is that something you would just take when you feel panicky?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Or just something you take every morning or?

DOCTOR X443
No I would take it like as needed.

PATIENT X443
Okay.

DOCTOR X443
When you feel panicky.  Don't take it every day cause that's not going to help us and you don't need to take it every day for you because you just whenever you have a panic attack you can just take it as needed.

PATIENT X443
Yeah.

DOCTOR X443
But and it wouldn't help with you're you know you already have the fatigue and sleepiness and stuff you're having, it'd make it worse if you took it every day.

PATIENT X443
Well you gave me some good advice here today doctor uh.

DOCTOR X443
Good.

PATIENT X443
Uh everything you say I knew I just forgot.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah, yeah.  You know what you need to do.  You know your body well.

PATIENT X443
Yeah I mean I got to eat at regular times.  I got to pick up my activity uh yeah I just got away from what other things I should be doing to make my body more efficient.

DOCTOR X443
Exactly.  Kind of like a whole body, the mind and body and soul approach.  Right you got to, it's all very interconnected so you know.  You know if you feel depressed your body's gonna feel tired as well so positive attitude goes along with.

PATIENT X443
Right.

DOCTOR X443
A lot of the other changes that we talked about.  I think you'll feel a lot better.  Let me go talk to my boss real quick okay and I'll be right back alright?

PATIENT X443
Okay and then are you gonna renew my meds?

DOCTOR X443
Exactly yeah.  I already put some in them I just have to fine tune them.

(DOCTOR OUT:  69:24  DOCTOR IN:  92:34)

DOCTOR X443
Sorry for the delay.  Uh okay so we're going to do everything as planned.  I'm gonna have you come back in, I'm gonna have you back in two weeks to have your blood pressure just checked here.

PATIENT X443
Okay.

DOCTOR X443
Okay.

PATIENT X443
So I could see the nurse?

DOCTOR X443
Give me a second I have one more thing to check.  Now if you are drinking alcohol, obviously we talked about stopping but if you're drinking alcohol remember do not take uh, you shouldn't be taking your Ativan.  Because like I told you how they work together.

PATIENT X443
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X443
So you may, it may drop you like into a coma or it may be too sedating okay.  So don't mix alcohol and that together, it can be very dangerous.  Um.

PATIENT X443
Is that the same as trazodone?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah trazodone again yeah don't I would stay away from drinking.  If you're drinking, if you've drunk I would stay away from the trazodone.

PATIENT X443
Well I'm not trying to really abstain.


DOCTOR X443
Yeah I mean ideally you want to totally abstain from the alcohol.

PATIENT X443
Since I was able to quit for 2 1/2 years.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah I mean you've already shown that you've done it so.  I'm reordering all your things here.

PATIENT X443
What's that one with an L, I don't take that anymore right?

DOCTOR X443
Loratadine?

PATIENT X443
Yeah.

DOCTOR X443
That's just for like allergies.

PATIENT X443
Oh yeah I was taking like something for xxxadryl.  See my arms how they're, they were giving something to take at night.  It was equivalent to uh like a xxxadryl or something.

DOCTOR X443
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X443
I forget the name of it but uh.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah what's up with your arms, are you scratching or?

PATIENT X443
Yeah I've got some kind of a, I went to a dermatologist.

DOCTOR X443
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X443
And he says there's nothing wrong just you have the type of skin he says like in the back he could take this pen.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.

PATIENT X443
And write a letter it'd stay there for a week.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X443
And he says but I do need something uh to take at night for allergies.

DOCTOR X443
Okay, do you want me to give you loratadine?

PATIENT X443
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X443
If that helps.  And we talked about, we talked about the metformin.  You're gonna drop the dose or not take it if you don't eat your meals.  Ideally you want to we talked about your meals and we talked about that.  Um I'm gonna give you some of that vardenafil.  They're not offering that anymore, so I'll discontinue that from your list.  You're gonna take the metoprolol and lisinopril as is.  You're not going to mix, don't mix trazodone or uh Ativan with alcohol.  Ideally you're gonna try to stop the alcohol altogether.

PATIENT X443
Right.

DOCTOR X443
We're gonna give you a referral for Psychology as well as addiction as well.  Okay.

PATIENT X443
And you did or the Levitra for me doctor?

DOCTOR X443
Yes.  I reordered that.  I've renewed the loratadine.  I renewed your metformin.  I renewed your aspirin.  I renewed the lisinopril.  Yeah.

PATIENT X443
Uh can you walk through the VA here.  Can you order me a multivitamin?

DOCTOR X443
Uh yeah. I renewed the terazosin as well okay.

PATIENT X443
Okay.  And then you put uh refills memo.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah there's like six refills.  On the ones I have 90 pills I gave uh yeah, the ones with 90 pills I gave three refills and uh the one with like 30 pills.

PATIENT X443
Yeah.

DOCTOR X443
The one month supply I gave six refills on it okay.

PATIENT X443
Uh one quick thing on my blood tests, did you see anything that was out of line that we didn't discuss?  Like my liver function?

DOCTOR X443
No liver functions were completely normal.  Cholesterol was great.  Uh you uh blood counts were okay.  Your electrolytes so the potassium were all okay.  Um your kidney function is okay, perfect, it was good.  Um your blood counts, your platelet counts, your white count and your blood tests were all okay.

PATIENT X443
Okay what is my cholesterol?

DOCTOR X443
Your cholesterol, your actual cholesterol well actually is low. The LDL which is the bad cholesterol which we want low is 31, very low.  I mean under, we consider really good control to be under 100.

PATIENT X443
And mine's 31?

DOCTOR X443
Your 31.

PATIENT X443
So then I ain't terrible.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah so I think it may be, there may be something with your lipid profile the way your genetic or the way your body handles the cholesterol that keeps your bad cholesterol really low which is a good thing.  Now the HDL, which is you want high, that's the good cholesterol, we like that number to be above 40 uh yours is 62 so that's really good.

PATIENT X443
Okay now I understand that.

DOCTOR X443
So a lot of good genes going on there uh.  How is, anybody in your family have like heart problems or heart attack or high cholesterol?

PATIENT X443
Uh my father died with a heart attack but he was um he had a cancer and his heart gave out.

DOCTOR X443
It wasn't like a young age, like 30 or something?

PATIENT X443
No and knock on wood I don't get any danger.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah so I mean yeah.  That's why I think you don't really need to be on the cholesterol one since your labs look pretty good.

PATIENT X443
Are you gonna take me off that?

DOCTOR X443
Yeah.  The cholesterol medicine you haven't been taking right?

PATIENT X443
Is that the simvastatin?

DOCTOR X443
Simvastatin yeah.

PATIENT X443
No I haven't been taking it.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah you don't need to take it.  We'll probably check your cholesterol you know maybe in a year or so and we'll see how it is and if at that time your cholesterol is high then you know we may you know put you back on it but given your numbers I don't think you need to be on it.

PATIENT X443
Hey do you know how much I weighed the last time I was here?

DOCTOR X443
You were 207 today right uh; you were 197 on the 21st.

PATIENT X443
197, now I'm 207.

DOCTOR X443
207 yeah.

PATIENT X443
I can feel those ten pounds too so.

DOCTOR X443
Yeah and again losing a little bit of weight um, getting up and doing some light exercise every day, eating healthier will make you feel better too in terms of the lethargy.

PATIENT X443
Right.  Okay I know what to do now I just got to implement what you've told me.

DOCTOR X443
I've got all your meds and they should mail it to you.  I've put the referrals in.

PATIENT X443

DOCTOR X443

PATIENT X443

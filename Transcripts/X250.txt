DOCTOR X250

PATIENT X250
Yes.

DOCTOR X250
Yeah that's typically uh musculoskeletal pain.

PATIENT X250
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X250
It doesn't really sound uh cardiac uh I mean it doesn't sound like that's coming from your heart.

PATIENT X250
Good.

DOCTOR X250
You're on aspirin, citalopram, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, omeprazole, simvastatin, Valsartan.

PATIENT X250

DOCTOR X250
Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.  And are you taking carvedilol Coreg?

PATIENT X250
Yes.

DOCTOR X250
It looks like some of these expired; I can try and reorder a bunch of them for you.  Your blood sugar looks pretty well controlled, that was quite a while ago, @@@.  So we want to get repeat blood work on you before you see your next doctor.

PATIENT X250
Okay.

DOCTOR X250
Okay, I'll reorder that Coreg to make sure you get that uh.  You're on Plavix as well?

PATIENT X250
Yes.

DOCTOR X250
And you're wearing a BiPAP machine, CPAP machine?  And you're not smoking?

PATIENT X250
No.

DOCTOR X250
Are you on the bupropion?

PATIENT X250
Yeah it's the pain medicine.  I have back pain.

DOCTOR X250
No this is a medication for smoking.

PATIENT X250
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR X250
Okay.

PATIENT X250
No I'm done, getting too old.

DOCTOR X250
Your thyroid function is normal.  Okay, have a seat up here.  Take a few deep breaths.  Just breathe normally.  So you know looking at your stuff here, I would continue the same medications for now.

PATIENT X250
Yeah.

DOCTOR X250
Um, really I think the thyroid function looks good, a little below normal from today.  We don't need to change anything for now.  Otherwise we'll need to have you, unfortunately, get another doctor.  I apologize.

PATIENT X250
No need to apologize.

DOCTOR X250
If I would have known that's why you were coming in I would have tried to change things but uh I didn't know.

PATIENT X250
No problem.  @@@.

DOCTOR X250
Um is there anything else I can do for you?

PATIENT X250
No everything is fine doc.

DOCTOR X250
Well let's try and set you free here.  

PATIENT X250
@@@.  I'm supposed to be using @@@.  Sometimes I just go to sleep eight hours, I'm perfectly fine, no problems and yesterday I was shopping with my wife, sleeping in the car and I @@@, I was sleeping, why is that?

DOCTOR X250
Now are you wearing the CPAP the entire time at night?

PATIENT X250
No.

DOCTOR X250
That machine.

PATIENT X250
Right no.

DOCTOR X250
How long do you wear it?

PATIENT X250
Sometimes I just kind of rip it, I would say.

DOCTOR X250
Right.

PATIENT X250
But I would say six months it was perfect and I didn't change any.

DOCTOR X250
Um that I mean that is likely why you've got this obesity hypoventilation syndrome uh so it's very important that you wear that CPAP.

PATIENT X250
Okay.

DOCTOR X250
You know other things could be thyroid problems but we just got your blood work today and that looks okay.  So you know the most.

PATIENT X250
Now that's just my question.  I don't why, is it something like being tired.  Cause everything is the same every day.

DOCTOR X250
The thing with your diagnosis and this obesity hypoventilation syndrome, that's one of the symptoms.  Uh it's just daytime fatigue, the sleepiness.  So if you don't wear the CPAP the entire time, you know if you're wearing your CPAP all day and all night then we would say maybe we need to look into other things.

PATIENT X250
Yes.

DOCTOR X250
But even then you could still have symptoms because you're not, you're gas exchange isn't normal.

PATIENT X250
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X250
@@@ and it gets worse at night and when that happens, your CO2 starts to build up.  

PATIENT X250
Right.

DOCTOR X250
Your carbon dioxide starts to build up and you start feeling sleepy uh, so that's why it's important to keep that CPAP on because that will help maintain the normal level of carbon dioxide uh while you may still sleep well at night without it, you're gonna be sleepy during the day if those levels are high.  So that's why it's important to wear that mask uh.

PATIENT X250
But it's not every day.  For the last three or four days I've been, I bet you it'll be a couple more days and then I'll be normal again.

DOCTOR X250
You know I still think that's probably the.

PATIENT X250
@@@.

DOCTOR X250
Otherwise you know, from what I know about you and examining you, it's not clear.  That's the far and away the most likely culprit.

PATIENT X250
It seems like, it seems like after my heart surgery, six months later I was passing out, passing out, passing out right, so I say doctor I think something's wrong.  I had to go to the hospital like @@@ weeks.  They couldn't figure out anything so you know what I did, I stopped taking the vitamin, then it disappeared.  Vitamin is a medicine, which is some kind of an extra and still doctors are worried.  I said doctor that's what I did right.  I said, you see what happened I took the medicine right at home and I could see after 15 minutes @@@ go down already.  

DOCTOR X250
Yeah that's.

PATIENT X250
Okay and then I could fall back and @@@.

DOCTOR X250
Yeah.

PATIENT X250
And I passed out and was in the hospital for weeks, you know they had to take to see what it was.  So @@@ I stopped taking medicines bang, I've @@@.

DOCTOR X250
So uh, it sounds like you're having allergic reactions.

PATIENT X250
Something yeah.

DOCTOR X250
You know you've been on all these other medicines for a while too, so that shouldn't be uh.

PATIENT X250
No but that was like eight years ago.

DOCTOR X250
Yeah.

PATIENT X250
Then I stopped taking, stopped taking the vitamin everything is fine.

DOCTOR X250
We'll get repeat blood work and uh you'll see a new doctor.

PATIENT X250
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X250
Once again I apologize.

PATIENT X250
Alright.

DOCTOR X250
That it was scheduled. Uh if there's anything I can do to help you, let me know.

PATIENT X250
Thank you, have a nice day doctor.

DOCTOR X270
PATIENT?  I'm DOCTOR, nice to meet you.

PATIENT X270
Hi DOCTOR, nice to meet you.

DOCTOR X270
@@@ last couple of months.

PATIENT X270
Oh.

DOCTOR X270
So @@@.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Okay have a seat.

PATIENT X270
Alright thank you.

DOCTOR X270
How are you doing?

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
@@@.

PATIENT X270
No it's alright.

DOCTOR X270
I'm getting a cold coming on.

PATIENT X270
Okay, alright.  Oh it's really cool outside now.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah exactly.  So um what can I do for you today?

PATIENT X270
Okay uh a couple things.  I had a VA pamphlet that I was reading over about ear wax.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
I wanted to have that checked cause I have noticeable hearing loss in my right ear and it runs in the family so that might be hereditary.  But also I have the tinnitus in my left ear that comes and goes.

DOCTOR X270
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X270
So I use hearing protection at my job but I still, you know I get, sometimes it's really bad and it lasts for several days.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Right now it's real slight, I can barely tell.  

DOCTOR X270
Anything else going on?  Just routine stuff?

PATIENT X270
Yeah routine and still I don't know if it mentions the sleep test I had in there but I still seem to be up and down.

DOCTOR X270
Oh that's right.

PATIENT X270
A while back yeah.

DOCTOR X270
No um I think we need to do a titration study this time cause you did it once before and they said to sleep on your side, do you remember?

PATIENT X270
Right.

DOCTOR X270
Did you try that?

PATIENT X270
Yeah well that's what I mostly do uh, especially with the acid reflux but occasionally I'll roll over on my back in the middle of the night and I'll wake up gasping and uh.  I've also noticed at times I have chalky taste in my mouth and my jaw hurts and my dentist says I'm grinding away my enamel hurting my teeth a lot.

DOCTOR X270
Oh and that happens with people with sleep apnea actually.

PATIENT X270
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X270
We can get that checked out.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Um let me see what your blood tests showed today also.  I can order that again for you.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Now the blood pressure looks okay I mean it's not terrible.

PATIENT X270
Yeah I haven't had that.  Every once in a while I'll get a shortness of breath thing going on but I think that's sometimes the acid reflux.

DOCTOR X270
It could be and it could be that its sleep apnea issues also.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Um what do you mean you get this shortness of breath thing?

PATIENT X270
Oh every once in a while I just uh.  I mean I work out fairly regularly.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah.  (Doctor speaks with someone who came to the door)  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X270
Yeah sure, no problem.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:30  DOCTOR IN:  36:14)

Knock on door.

PATIENT X270
Yep.

DOCTOR X270
Okay, alright.  Okay so you work out and then you occasionally get short of breath when you're done?

PATIENT X270
Yeah well not so much in my workouts, it's weird.  It comes and goes.  I may be doing a job or maybe just around the house or something.

DOCTOR X270
So you're usually doing an activity when it happens.

PATIENT X270
Well yeah right.  I've never had anything hit me like when I'm working out.  I mean there's days when I'm so exhausted I just skip my workout.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Which is uh, it's kind of a cardio and some light weights type of a workout.

DOCTOR X270
Well we can um, have you ever had an echocardiogram?  An ultrasound of the heart?

PATIENT X270
Um no.

DOCTOR X270
That's something we can look at.  Cause sometimes people with sleep apnea have very high blood pressure on one side of the heart.

PATIENT X270
Oh.

DOCTOR X270
So, very high blood pressure on one side of the heart meaning the side that goes into the lungs because you can get what's called pulmonary hypertension so you can have normal blood pressures systemically like when we do the cuff.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
But when it runs through your lungs there's high pressure and when that's the case you can get problems uh even sudden cardiac death.

PATIENT X270
Oh yikes.

DOCTOR X270
So we can, I don't think that's what's happening.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Probably not but I just want to be safe and check that since you do have some sleep apnea um.  It looks like there is an element of sleep apnea I think but maybe it is necessarily just positional so.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
We'll order the echo I think and then we'll order another sleep study it's what they previously recommended.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
So that they can titrate you, meaning they can see what level of the mask works for you.

PATIENT X270
Okay great.

DOCTOR X270
And I know that was a terrible study for you last time cause I noted that the notes said it was worse than your usual sleep.

PATIENT X270
It was really cold in the room for one thing and uh I took two sleeping pill, over-the-counter.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah.

PATIENT X270
So 50 mg Toradol and I just couldn't get drowsy till late.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah.

PATIENT X270
You know and then one time I guess I fell asleep on my back and they screamed over the thing to wake up and roll on my side.

DOCTOR X270
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT X270
And like if something was going on and I go from like my sofa to my bed and with the sofa it forces me to lay on one side.

DOCTOR X270
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X270
But then you know I get up cause my shoulder's sore and.

DOCTOR X270
Well then maybe having the CPAP mask is the way to go.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
So we'll check that out again.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Yeah that'd great because being tired you know, the memory and you know the concentration problem.

DOCTOR X270
Exactly.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Now are you having any um more outbreaks of the rash now and then?

PATIENT X270
Uh I had one; I just got over one about a week ago.  That's because my prescription ran out.  I phoned in for a renewal and it said well they have to check so and so.  So I figured they would check it and would automatically send me and then nothing came and I like called uh and reordered and now I've been on it for a couple days.

DOCTOR X270
We're gonna get you assigned to me I think so.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
That you have a regular doctor instead of you know this person and that person so that way um you won't get things lost like that again.

PATIENT X270
Okay great.  That'd be great.

DOCTOR X270
And then I'll just follow up with all your sleep studies and all your imaging exams and everything um and your cholesterol and all that okay.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Um and I'll be around for about one more year.

PATIENT X270
Alright.

DOCTOR X270
And we're gonna have to look for.

PATIENT X270
Oh brother.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah.

PATIENT X270
Oh you're like the fourth.

DOCTOR X270
I know.

PATIENT X270
Why do I have all those doctors so far so I think.

DOCTOR X270
Well good I might be here then.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
No smoking, no alcohol?

PATIENT X270
Never smoked.  Rarely drink; my drinking is very rare because of the reflux too.  It's like drinking acid for me.

DOCTOR X270
How about blood in the stool, nothing like that?  Oh and you had a colonoscopy which was perfect.

PATIENT X270
Which was perfect yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.  The only blood in the stool, I mean not in the stool, just the hemorrhoids you know, the only blood I see there but yeah, no black stool or any of that.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah good.  Okay so let's examine you here.  This cold is kind of grossing me out.  So what are the xxx xxx?

PATIENT X270
That's my company business.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
It's my dad and I.

DOCTOR X270
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X270
Mother and I and mom of course does the books and we uh manufacture and install custom made aluminum awnings.

DOCTOR X270
Really, very nice.

PATIENT X270
Patio covers.

DOCTOR X270
You manufacture it?

PATIENT X270
Yeah, we measure and manufacture everything ourselves.

DOCTOR X270
That's excellent.  How long?

PATIENT X270
Well when I started after I left the service 25 years ago it was a good business but now with the economy.

DOCTOR X270
Right.

PATIENT X270
So there's more stress because things.

DOCTOR X270
I understand.

PATIENT X270
Yeah, so far this year it's not looking too bad.

DOCTOR X270
Very good.

PATIENT X270
You need the shirt up or?

DOCTOR X270
Oh no, no.

PATIENT X270
Okay cool.

DOCTOR X270
Deep breath.  Sounds good.  Go ahead and sit back.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
No stomach pain with your acid reflux ever?

PATIENT X270
Uh occasionally, I have a little bit today drinking a Sprite.

DOCTOR X270
You did.

PATIENT X270
Yeah I got a little.

DOCTOR X270
I'll have you lean back.  How often does that bother you?

PATIENT X270
Um.

DOCTOR X270
Your reflux symptoms.  The pains are here usually or no?

PATIENT X270
It, sometimes I'll have them down in the, down in here.

DOCTOR X270
Oh.

PATIENT X270
That I can feel it.

DOCTOR X270
Coming up?

PATIENT X270
Yeah especially if I bend over which I try to avoid.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
I notice I have to eat a lot less than I used to.

DOCTOR X270
Have you ever been scoped from the top before?

PATIENT X270
Yeah before I started coming to the VA.

DOCTOR X270
You have.

PATIENT X270
Yeah back when we had health insurance at work I had.

DOCTOR X270
That may be another we can consider.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
I know I'm trying a lot of tests.

PATIENT X270
That's uh, it was at xxx xxx xxx, DOCTOR there and he went with a scope and that's when I found out that I had a hiatal hernia.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Yeah the flap doesn't close.

DOCTOR X270
What year was that do you remember?

PATIENT X270
Oh man, that's got to be, let's see before 9/11 I'm thinking cause I.

DOCTOR X270
Wow that's quite some time.

PATIENT X270
It's been some time.  I'm thinking, you know I'll find out for sure.  I can look up my records.  Maybe it wasn't that long ago.  My memory's terrible for that sort of thing um but it was about a year before I started coming to the VA so, which I think I started around 9/11, I mean 01 or 02.

DOCTOR X270
And that's happening several times a day or several times a week the symptoms?

PATIENT X270
I'd say more several times a week.  Yeah I don't get it every day.

DOCTOR X270
And you're taking the omeprazole 40 once daily?

PATIENT X270
I'm taking it once in the morning and once in the evening.

DOCTOR X270
Oh twice a day.

PATIENT X270
Twice a day whatever the standard capsule I think it was yeah.  And occasionally when its bad at night, I try not to eat late but sometimes I do and then I use a chewable like an over-the-counter like a Pepto Bismol chewable sort of a.

DOCTOR X270
I think it might be time to get the scope done okay.

PATIENT X270
Alright.

DOCTOR X270
Um but we can, so there's like three tests that I kind of want to do for you.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
I'll make sure things are okay.  In addition to your routine blood work and stuff.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Um now you need to get your cholesterol checked again and diabetes screened um.  Well that was back in September, I don't think we need to do that.

PATIENT X270
Right away.  Yeah they were doing it, yeah when I first started on the cholesterol drug cause I was getting it every six months or less at this point now.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah maybe we should check again.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Next spring sometime.

PATIENT X270
Alright.

DOCTOR X270
So then you have to be fasting though.

PATIENT X270
That's okay; I've done that every time.

DOCTOR X270
Do you live far away though?  Where's xxx xxx?

PATIENT X270
It's uh, its right by xxx.  Well from here it's about 35 miles.

DOCTOR X270
@@@ ideally I'd like you to come back to get these done fasting.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Um.

PATIENT X270
I can do it.  The nice thing about being a family business is it's really flexible about that.  Which is why I come to xxx cause our business is in xxx.

DOCTOR X270
Oh, okay.

PATIENT X270
So I'm not going to xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X270
Oh okay, well okay.

PATIENT X270
Cause it's always easier for me here.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Um.

DOCTOR X270
I wondered about that.

PATIENT X270
Yeah and they ask that every time.

DOCTOR X270
So they thought there's something in xxx.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Well why don't we um, we maybe can try and coordinate it with when you have one of these other tests so that you're not coming here too frequently.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
But the orders will be in the computer and then.

PATIENT X270
Okay sure that'd be fine yeah.  The fasting like I said is not a problem, I've done that you know every time.

DOCTOR X270
And then once I get those lab tests back then I can maybe order you the gastroenterologists here to take a look from up top.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
To see what's going on okay.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X270
Sure.

DOCTOR X270
Any questions?

PATIENT X270
Uh no, so far it sounds good other than you could take a look in my ears just.

DOCTOR X270
Absolutely that's why you came in here.  Why don't you have a seat?

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Take your shirt off.  It's not unusual.

PATIENT X270
To record.  Yeah basically I hadn't read that, I just assumed it was hereditary and aging but I want to run that by you.

DOCTOR X270
But you're too young for that @@@.

PATIENT X270
Alright cause I know my dad, before he passed away, he had two hearing aids and he came here all the time.

DOCTOR X270
It looks very clear on the left side.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
So here's what I'm gonna do actually, probably have you see, yeah there's zero wax in there.

PATIENT X270
Oh okay great.

DOCTOR X270
We'll have that cleaned.

PATIENT X270
Then I know what it is.  I know, I know.

DOCTOR X270
Well, do you want to evaluate it further though by one of the doctors here or?

PATIENT X270
Well what do you?

DOCTOR X270
The ENT doctors or audiologists here, they do the hearing aids.

PATIENT X270
Oh okay, well I don't think I'm bad enough where I need a hearing aid yet, you know where I mean kind of a prescription one.  I just have if it's a noisy environment, like in a restaurant I can't hear somebody too well if they talk to my right ear.

DOCTOR X270
Especially a high voice then.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
If it's usually high voices then you have a high pitch?

PATIENT X270
No I don't hear the low.

DOCTOR X270
You hear low voices okay.

PATIENT X270
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Or the soft, like I have a favorite restaurant and I have a favorite waitress and she's really quiet and she always come to my right side and I've always got to you know turn my head.

DOCTOR X270
Well maybe um, well it's an option if you'd like to be evaluated by the audiologist or your doctor.

PATIENT X270
Yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR X270
Think about it, give us a call, call in.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
And if you want the referral then we can do it for you okay.

PATIENT X270
Okay yeah let's try it that way.  As long as I know it's not a buildup.

DOCTOR X270
No there is nothing in there.

PATIENT X270
Cause I know those Q-Tips.

DOCTOR X270
Don't use Q-Tips, they cause impactions and can pack all the wax in there.

PATIENT X270
That's what I was worried about.

DOCTOR X270
I'll be right back then.

PATIENT X270
Okay sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:28  DOCTOR IN:  59:44)

DOCTOR X270
Okay, so I was talking to the other doctors here.

PATIENT X270
Sure.

DOCTOR X270
And we think that we should just have you see the ear doctors just the same.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
You can make an appointment like for two months down the road though cause they're usually real full anyway.

PATIENT X270
Sure.

DOCTOR X270
That way we just have it in already.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
But we probably should get the scope again.

PATIENT X270
Alright.

DOCTOR X270
And the sleep test again and then instead of an echo, you know the ultrasound.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Do a stress test to look at things.

PATIENT X270
Okay.  That's where I got to run on the machine or something?

DOCTOR X270
Yeah.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
Well you exert yourself.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
More at work or it depends.  For some people they can exert themselves more at work.

PATIENT X270
Probably at work because it's more constant.  I don't go to the gym, I work out at home.

DOCTOR X270
Oh okay.

PATIENT X270
Uh I have a mat and free weights and uh, I basically follow Fit TV, I don't know if you've ever heard of Total Body Scope where they go on, it's a program that's on.  It's a 30 minute.

DOCTOR X270
I think I've heard of it.

PATIENT X270
Yeah well I do that.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Pretty much every day and then work is physical.  I'm on my feet most of the day or up and down ladders.

DOCTOR X270
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X270
Lifting, drilling brick or whatever so uh yeah.

DOCTOR X270
So it's pretty physical then.

PATIENT X270
It's pretty physical yeah right.  That's probably what keeps me from being fat.

DOCTOR X270
That's good.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.

DOCTOR X270
We'll keep it that way.

PATIENT X270
Yeah cause I don't always eat right at work.  I know I don't eat enough fiber.  I take Fiber Choice tablets to kind of make up for it but you know.

DOCTOR X270
So here's what we're gonna do um, so in order to get the scope ordered, the EGD to take a look at the heartburn issues, you have to get labs done for that.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
But if you're gonna get labs done for that, you might as well.

PATIENT X270
Cholesterol and everything else.

DOCTOR X270
Exactly.  So let's set it up that you come back maybe sometime next week.

PATIENT X270
Sounds fine.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Any time.

DOCTOR X270
Yeah and you literally can come back any time as long as you've had nothing to eat after midnight.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Or prior.

PATIENT X270
So it's like 14 hours, something like that.

DOCTOR X270
Exactly right.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
That's what it is.

PATIENT X270
Okay, I'm usually at like 16 hours by the time I get in there.

DOCTOR X270
Oh that's plenty, plenty.

PATIENT X270
Yeah okay.  Then I go get a nice greasy cheeseburger, fries, no.

DOCTOR X270
Well.

PATIENT X270
Actually I eat like that a lot, I try to avoid it but, you know how it is.  You're on the job and you're running, can't always stop for something healthy.  Talk about stress too, when you hear about how they cut all us category 7 and 8 veterans out of the health care system.

DOCTOR X270
Oh really.

PATIENT X270
Yeah that's what.

DOCTOR X270
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT X270
The Tea Partier's have been talking about cutting funding and I just go man, that'll be it for my statin drugs and everything else.

DOCTOR X270
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT X270
Yeah.  That's more than I can afford on my own.  But the veteran groups are fighting it so we'll see.

(Knock on the door.  Doctor speaks to person at the door.)

DOCTOR X270
Okay, I want to make sure I have everything ordered.

PATIENT X270
Okay.  And my meds are all renewed for another year now too, cool.

DOCTOR X270
PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT X270
PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR X270
PHONE NUMBER.

PATIENT X270
Yeah, that's my home phone.  You should have my cell in there as well.

DOCTOR X270
Would you rather have the cell phone here?

PATIENT X270
Um yeah you know.

DOCTOR X270
Cause which ever you want.

PATIENT X270
PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR X270
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X270
PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.  PHONE NUMBER.

PATIENT X270
Correct.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Yeah cause I might get rid of my home line so, the cell is probably better.  I've always got that with me.  

DOCTOR X270
Okay, you're all set.  So fasting labs in one week, Audiology or ENT that's the ear stuff, about eight weeks, stress test as soon as you can.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
CPAP titration, the sleep test as soon as you can.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
And then we'll get the EGD, a scope after all the labs have been done.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270
Okay.

PATIENT X270
Alright.

DOCTOR X270
Alright.

PATIENT X270
Okay.

DOCTOR X270

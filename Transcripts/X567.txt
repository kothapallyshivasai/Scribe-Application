Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X567
Do want any nicotine gum or any patches?  Sit up here.

PATIENT X567
I'd try some gum.

DOCTOR X567
You want to try some gum okay.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X567
Nice deep breaths, again.  How much, um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day?

PATIENT X567
About half a pack.

DOCTOR X567
Half a pack.  And how long have you been smoking for?

PATIENT X567
38 years.

DOCTOR X567
38 years okay.  Okay so the thing about the gum is that um you can't chew it and smoke at the same time.  So if you're gonna smoke, then you spit it out.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X567
What you do is you take the gum; you chew it a little bit when you get the urge and then you park it in the back of the mouth.  You don't keep chewing it cause this is going to keep releasing nicotine.  Once that urge goes away then you park it and then you chew it again if you have another urge.  If you have to have a smoke then spit it out.  Be careful @@@ okay.

PATIENT X567
Okay.

DOCTOR X567
Let me order that for a pick-up.  Do you want to pick that up today?

PATIENT X567
Yes.

DOCTOR X567

PATIENT X567

DOCTOR X567
All at once?  You want me to just order all your medications for pick-up today?

PATIENT X567
Yes.

DOCTOR X567
Okay.

PATIENT X567
So you said I got 30 days to get it right?

DOCTOR X567
Uh-huh.  Do you know how much hydrochlorothiazide you're on?  Is it 12.5 or 25 mg?

PATIENT X567
I don't know.

DOCTOR X567
You don't know um hmm.  How do I order this then for you?  Do you want to call back or how do you want this done because I don't know what dose you're on.

PATIENT X567
The lowest dosage.

DOCTOR X567
It's the lowest dosage?

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X567
Okay.  Do you take half a pill or a whole pill?

PATIENT X567
Whole pill.

DOCTOR X567
You take a whole one then I think its 25 mg then okay.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.  Sound about right, 25 mg that sound about right.

DOCTOR X567
Yeah cause half a pill would be 12.5.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X567

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

(DOCTOR OUT:  18:53  DOCTOR IN:  21:45)

DOCTOR X567
Have you had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X567
No.

DOCTOR X567
Are you interested in having one?

PATIENT X567
I don't know, it depends on how long will it take?

DOCTOR X567
Um you've got to prep so you have diarrhea for about a day and then the procedure so when you go in it's uh kind of wait a little bit, they prep you and then they go in.  Actually it's a 30-40 minute procedure but there are, there's a time period where you do have to wait while you're there.  Um mainly because they give you stuff to sedate you and then you need someone to drive you home.

PATIENT X567
Well maybe next year.

DOCTOR X567
Maybe next year okay.  Did you get your flu shot this year?

PATIENT X567
Around January.  @@@ yes, yes.

DOCTOR X567
You did get your flu shot okay great.

PATIENT X567
As a matter of fact your nurses gave them to me.

DOCTOR X567
Oh yeah you said that.

PATIENT X567
About that colonoscopy, what are you guys looking for?

DOCTOR X567
We're looking for cancer.

PATIENT X567
Colon cancer?

DOCTOR X567
Uh-huh.  So the reason why we um screen for colon cancer early, starting at the age of 50 is because uh colon cancer is asymptomatic so a lot of times when you have it you don't even know you have it.  If we catch it early while it's still in the asymptomatic stage.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X567
Then it's easier to treat than if we check later and it spreads everywhere.

PATIENT X567
If I had colon cancer what would some of the symptoms be?

DOCTOR X567
Um you might have some bleeding from below, you might have some weight loss but sometimes you can be completely asymptomatic so you don't know.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.  If you schedule it it's got to be for January.

DOCTOR X567
Yeah I mean, so I mean do you want me to set you up for it or not right now?

PATIENT X567
Not right now.

DOCTOR X567
Not right now okay.

PATIENT X567
Why did you guys stop sending me my ED pills?

DOCTOR X567
You're what?

PATIENT X567
Erection dysfunctional pills?

DOCTOR X567
Hold on let me see.  I don't know.

PATIENT X567
Could you have them send them back to me?

DOCTOR X567
Sure I can ask, that's a question for DOCTOR, you can ask her when she comes in here okay.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X567
Were they working for you?

PATIENT X567
Yes they were.  I miss them too.

DOCTOR X567
So these actually have to be mailed to you.

PATIENT X567
And I want to know why they stopped, what happened, how come they stopped mailing them to me.

DOCTOR X567
I'm not sure why they stopped.  I'm going to give you some more of those though.

PATIENT X567
So like what does it mean? 

DOCTOR X567
No thoughts of um hurting yourself, hurting others?

PATIENT X567
No, no, no, no.

DOCTOR X567
Great.  Alright, I don't know what's taking so long for this.  

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Did you page me?

FIRST DOCTOR X567
Oh yeah sorry, can you take your shoe off again so she can look at your toe?

SECOND DOCTOR X567
How long has it been bothering you? 

PATIENT X567
It's not bothering me, its ugly looking.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Oh okay.  So how long has it been going on?
 
PATIENT X567
About ten years.  Every time I cut it off it grows back the same way.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Looks like an ingrown toenail.  And it doesn't hurt at the base of this toe a lot?

PATIENT X567
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Oh uh-huh.  Lay back for me sir.  Never hurts you at all?

PATIENT X567
Uh uh.

(Doctors discuss between themselves)

PATIENT X567
Should it be hurting?

SECOND DOCTOR X567
No it's good that it's not hurting.  I'm just surprised that it's not hurting at all @@@.  Um there's no liver disease or anything?

PATIENT X567
No liver disease.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Do you drink sir?

PATIENT X567
I was @@@, I been clean 20 months.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Good.  You're not drinking at all?

PATIENT X567
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Excellent.

(Doctors talk among themselves)

SECOND DOCTOR X567
So uh you definitely have a problem with an infection in your toenail.  Um I want you to see the foot doctors and we'll see what they think would be like an option for you but cutting it, with just starting you on a fungal medication and using it for a while, seeing what happens to your toe and if it gets better then I think in the end you're still going to need to get part of the toenail cut off and hopefully it'll re-grow normally.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
But I think they're probably going to say you need to take a fungal medication for quite some time, months in fact, before they'll cut it okay.  Cause this will probably control this infection.  Uh when you have a fungal infection in your toenails it doesn't cause a blood infection.  It's not going to go into a bloodstream and cause you know sickness.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Uh if it is causing that, actually this is quite severe uh.  In order for a fungal medication to work you have to take it the entire time your toenail is growing.  So it doesn't matter how slow your toenail grows, you have to take this medicine for 2-3 months sometimes while the toenail is growing so all the new growth does not have fungus in it.  Uh some of the medications use a, can cause.  You can get dressed.  Can cause nerve problems and that's why we were asking you about hepatitis prevention and stuff.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
So you have to come in every one month to two months to get uh blood tests to make sure your liver is okay.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

(Doctors talk among themselves)

SECOND DOCTOR X567
So uh it is an option.  I want you to talk to the foot doctors first and then we'll go from there.

PATIENT X567
Gotcha.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Okay.  So you can make an appointment up front with the foot doctors um.  I do want you to know because we're in that same pool, it doesn't sound like cosmetic so if you decide you don't want to do any of these things because you're worried about hurting your liver or whatever, then that's an option too because this is not going to cause a blood borne.

PATIENT X567
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
And this is @@@ so you have to decide if you're willing to take that risk.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
I can't decide that for you.

PATIENT X567
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Okay, questions?

PATIENT X567
Uh uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Okay.  So why don't you put your shoes and socks back on.  I'll put in the Podiatry consult and you can make an appointment up front okay.

PATIENT X567
I have to make the appointment for the foot doctor?

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Yeah they'll make it right up front.

PATIENT X567
They can do that?

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Yeah.

PATIENT X567
Can you do it @@@?

FIRST DOCTOR X567
No I don't do that; they can do it up front though.

SECOND DOCTOR X567
Of course they can.  Okay but we'll put the order in the computer for you today.

FIRST DOCTOR X567
Alright for this is for you, take it out to the front desk and I'm gonna you to go to the Lab to check your liver profile, to get the liver labs.  You haven't had one in over a year okay.  So @@@ your liver.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X567
It's something that you could consider, I'll be happy to talk to the podiatrist okay.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X567
They can see if they can possibly treat it, um after they cut it out and stuff and that is also an option but we're not the foot specialist and I'm not really sure what I can offer you.
 
PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X567
Other than the medicine okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X567
Do you know what's @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X567
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X567
You can tell me, I was @@@ 80%, 60%, 30% of health care here?

FIRST DOCTOR X567
I will check on what you're covered if you like.  It should say on this piece of paper.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X567
I do believe but it doesn't.  You can ask them up front how much, what percent you are but it doesn't say right here and I'm not really sure where I would find it @@@.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X567
Oh you're free to go.  All you have to do is go up to the front and schedule your foot doctor appointment, hopefully as soon as possible but they schedule it cause it's written on that piece of paper, then go to the Lab and get your labs done and @@@ next year.  Feel free to pick up your medicines whenever @@@.

PATIENT X567
Uh-huh.

Patient leaves 38:25.

PATIENT X707
Huh?

DOCTOR X707

PATIENT X707
I can tell you this way my feet I know they're swelling up a little bit uh.

DOCTOR X707

PATIENT X707
The ankles at the top of the arch like over here.

DOCTOR X707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X707
You can see the way this.

DOCTOR X707
Yeah.

PATIENT X707
Bunches up, historically it never was like that.

DOCTOR X707
Oh okay.

PATIENT X707
So now I know I'm getting you know.

DOCTOR X707
So your feet swelled up it looks like here.  It looks like they're swollen.  Did you hurt it or anything?

PATIENT X707
No I think just the old age starting to catch up with me see.

DOCTOR X707
Yeah so I don't see a lot of swelling there.

PATIENT X707
Well at the end of the day.

DOCTOR X707
@@@.

PATIENT X707
No as I say it's not really swelled up and I know at the end of the day.

DOCTOR X707
It hurts.

PATIENT X707
And when I walk.  No it don't really hurt it's uh like you're walking on mush or something like that.  

DOCTOR X707
So there's just discomfort and it swells sometimes?

PATIENT X707
Yeah at night.

DOCTOR X707
Do you take anything for that?

PATIENT X707
Well they're giving me the water pill and I guess I'm starting to build water up.  It don't seem like I'm producing.

DOCTOR X707
Hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X707
More fluid than before.

DOCTOR X707
Are you peeing a lot?

PATIENT X707
It don't seem like it.  Least I don't notice any difference you know.

DOCTOR X707
Okay.  And your blood pressure do you check it at home at all?

PATIENT X707
Yes I do.  This morning it was high and yet this morning when I checked it at home and it was real low.

DOCTOR X707
Oh.

PATIENT X707
So what I'm gonna tell you, it's a white coat effect.

DOCTOR X707
I don't know what has it been running at home?

PATIENT X707
Uh I know it was in the 30 and maybe 20 or 23 even.  I check it two or three times sometimes you know cause I.

DOCTOR X707
So it's running between the 120s, 130s?

PATIENT X707
No, no, no.  I should've brought the book with me, I keep a record of it but.

DOCTOR X707
Okay yeah it's a little elevated here.  You're on a very small dose of the water pill so it might not be doing that much.

PATIENT X707
Oh there's one other thing the ear, I don't know if you know uh skin will peel when you get sunburned.

DOCTOR X707
Yeah, does your ears have that feeling?

PATIENT X707
In this one only, I can scrape a lot of the dead skin out.  I don't know what's eating in there.

DOCTOR X707
It's dry, probably due to the weather, it's really dry.

PATIENT X707
No but then why ain't the other one?

DOCTOR X707
Sometimes one will be more affected, I'll look at it.

PATIENT X707
But it's all year long it seems like, both summer, winter, spring, fall.

DOCTOR X707
Really, okay.  Well I mean if it's a skin problem we could always you know have Derm see you and see if they recommend any topical treatments.

PATIENT X707
Uh they gave me some kind of a cream for the darn finger.

DOCTOR X707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X707
And the detail sheet says don't put it on the fingernail so I don't know where I was supposed to be putting it.

DOCTOR X707
Hmm.

PATIENT X707
I broke the finger, ran into a door, a guy opened his car door and I biked right into it.

DOCTOR X707
Has this peeling of your ear, is it affecting your hearing or no?

PATIENT X707
No, no, it's just a bit of an itch, you know a bit of a nuisance.  

DOCTOR X707
Okay.  Other than that, any chest pain, any shortness of breath?

PATIENT X707
No.

DOCTOR X707
Any @@@ issues?

PATIENT X707
But I do get the pain in the right ear from time to time because I think there's a fluid build-up in there and I was reluctant to have them drain it.

DOCTOR X707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X707
Maybe I should get it pinched and drained.

DOCTOR X707
And so it's just the hydrochlorothiazide they started back in October so you've been on it for a few months now is that right?

PATIENT X707
Yes.

DOCTOR X707
Okay.

PATIENT X707
They can do blood tests so I didn't eat this morning, I only had tea.

DOCTOR X707
And so the liver you saw, did you see the liver doctors?

PATIENT X707
Well they said there's not enough blood vessels in there and.

DOCTOR X707
When did you have the bladder cancer?

PATIENT X707
'98 and then after that I don't know how many years within a year or what they gave me the BCG treatment.

DOCTOR X707
Uh-huh.  Okay.  Have you followed up with them at all recently?

PATIENT X707
They just uh interviewed me what was it on December 26th, 27th, they didn't take any urine specimens or anything else, he just primarily interview.

DOCTOR X707
Okay, okay.  Let's see what they said in their note.  The last @@@ cystoscopy.  And you're still on sildenafil, are you still using that?  Sort of to help @@@.

PATIENT X707
Yes.

DOCTOR X707
Is it working?

PATIENT X707
I don't know I didn't get the pills yet, they might have mailed them.

DOCTOR X707
Okay.  And it looks like you need your cholesterol medication.

PATIENT X707
Yes.

DOCTOR X707
Your cholesterol looks better.  They checked it in July and um let's see what it was before uh it looks like you got an echo when you were @@@ go over the results of that.

PATIENT X707
Right.

DOCTOR X707
Let me pull it up.  You're due for your flu and your Pneumovax vaccines also.

PATIENT X707
No I don't want any of them.

DOCTOR X707
You don't want any of them.  We have to at least ask, that's fine.

PATIENT X707
Yeah no.  I didn't get the polio shots.  I didn't get the flu shots.

DOCTOR X707
No.  Okay, @@@ that.

PATIENT X707
Hope nature will fight it off, whatever.

DOCTOR X707
Yeah.  Alright it says that your heart is pumping properly um.  You have mild to moderate aortic regurg so @@@ watching that as long as you're asymptomatic, so that's good.

PATIENT X707
I might have been born that way, although there might be some stenosis I guess they said.

DOCTOR X707
Um no stenosis of the aortic valve, they said there might be sclerosis but that's not worrisome; it's just that the regurg that's worrisome that's what we want to follow.  

PATIENT X707
Makes a lot of noise, I can tell you that when it's on the echocardiogram.

DOCTOR X707
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X707
Slurping around in there.

DOCTOR X707
Uh oh.  Let's see, do you still smoke?

PATIENT X707
No I gave that up maybe 50 years ago on my own.

DOCTOR X707
You quit smoking, very good.  Why don't you go ahead and I'll have you sit up there and I'll listen to your lungs.

PATIENT X707
Do you need the shirt off or anything?  Is DOCTOR your supervisor?

DOCTOR X707
Yes.  You haven't seen her for a while right?

PATIENT X707
Yeah.

DOCTOR X707
Is this the ear?

PATIENT X707
Nope, the left one.  This one don't seem to be getting dead skin so something's in there eaten me.

DOCTOR X707
When the itching comes, do you take anything?

PATIENT X707
Yeah.

DOCTOR X707
For the itching?

PATIENT X707
Nope nothing.  Oh I do put in a little peroxide, hopefully if there's anything alive in there it might still be you know surface bacteria but it don't seem to be really and on the shampoo, I will put the shampoo in there too, that pink stuff they gave me.

DOCTOR X707
Uh-huh.  So, it looks a little red and irritated um, there's a little bit of peeling.  It's not affecting your hearing right?

PATIENT X707
No.

DOCTOR X707
And it's not all the way inside right?

PATIENT X707
No.

DOCTOR X707
Just right here.  I don't really see that much.  It's a little red but that might just be some @@@.  Do you stick your finger in there and itch it?

PATIENT X707
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X707
Yeah.

PATIENT X707
Scrape it out.

DOCTOR X707
We could give you something for the itching.  I don't think it's anything too concerning.  I don't even see a rash.

PATIENT X707
Like I said it keeps producing the dead skin.

DOCTOR X707
Yeah.

PATIENT X707
And I don't get it in the right ear at all.

DOCTOR X707
Hmm.

PATIENT X707
So I don't know why but.

DOCTOR X707
Okay.  Deep breath, again.  Let me take a look at your ankle.  I don't appreciate any swelling.  Does it hurt when you bend it?

PATIENT X707
No.  As I said it seems like I'm walking on mush.

DOCTOR X707
@@@.

PATIENT X707
You know like a sponge.

DOCTOR X707
On just this one?

PATIENT X707
No on both of them.

DOCTOR X707
Okay, it's not painful or anything?

PATIENT X707
No it's you get some sensation and you know it ain't uh.

DOCTOR X707
Do you feel like you get like numbness or tingling in the your leg.

PATIENT X707
No, no.

DOCTOR X707
Or anything like that, no.  Okay.  Let me talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

SECOND DOCTOR X707
Actually @@@.  Okay so your blood pressure is high today.  Have you been taking your medicine or is it @@@?

PATIENT X707
No I been taking the medicine.  This morning when I checked the blood pressure at home.  I think it came down to 123.

SECOND DOCTOR X707
So you have a home blood pressure monitor?

PATIENT X707
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X707
And it is low.

PATIENT X707
Not always though.  Sometimes it'll jump up to 160 and then I'll try to.

SECOND DOCTOR X707
Sometimes in 160s, what is the @@@.

PATIENT X707
No then I'll try to relax and I find out if I put the hand here and the @@@ on the table.

SECOND DOCTOR X707

PATIENT X707
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X707
If we need to increase the medication we can do that.

PATIENT X707
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X707
Cause otherwise if your home blood pressure is okay then most likely we don't need to increase it.

PATIENT X707
Okay.

Doctors speak among themselves.

FIRST DOCTOR X707
Okay so um I'm gonna get an x-ray of your foot just to make sure nothing else is going on.

PATIENT X707

FIRST DOCTOR X707
Yeah.

PATIENT X707
I can walk but it's just.

FIRST DOCTOR X707

FIRST DOCTOR X707
Do you still want to get it or no?

PATIENT X707
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X707
No just the left, we'll just do the left.

PATIENT X707
Well like I say it affects both feet.

FIRST DOCTOR X707
Arthritis, oh no, oh you're saying it affects both feet when you walking around.

PATIENT X707
Yeah it affects both feet.

FIRST DOCTOR X707

PATIENT X707
Uh-huh.  How do you, what do you do just simply call in for an appointment if I needed to come in earlier?

FIRST DOCTOR X707
Uh-huh, yep cause all they need is they'll send you a letter so you might give them a call if you need an appointment sooner okay.  And then @@@ will decide whether we need to increase the hydrochlorothiazide alright.

PATIENT X707

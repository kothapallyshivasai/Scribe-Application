DOCTOR X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Hold on one second.  Okay, it looks like your last A1c was 05/24/10.

PATIENT X532

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  

PATIENT X532

DOCTOR X532
So repeat your insulin levels, your insulin regimen again.

PATIENT X532

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  So then you take Glargine, what time during the day?

PATIENT X532
When I get up.

DOCTOR X532
When you get up in the morning, you take the long-acting insulin when you get up.

PATIENT X532
No @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Do know what the Glargine is?  When I say Glargine what do you think?  Is it long-acting or short-acting?

PATIENT X532

Well it goes down.

DOCTOR X532
What does it go down to?

PATIENT X532
@@@ 182, it was down to 130.

DOCTOR X532
130 before you eat lunch?

PATIENT X532
Yeah after.

DOCTOR X532
After you eat lunch?

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
What is it before you eat lunch?

PATIENT X532
It was like 180, @@@.

DOCTOR X532
And you don't take any insulin with lunch correct?

PATIENT X532
Right.  No I take it when I get up.

DOCTOR X532
You take the short-acting when you get up.

PATIENT X532
The regular one.

DOCTOR X532
When do you take the Glargine then?  When do you take the long-acting.

PATIENT X532
I been taking it.

DOCTOR X532
At bedtime okay.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
So you take the long-acting at bedtime.  You get up its like 284 and that's without eating.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
And then you take the 24 units now.

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
In the morning before you eat.

PATIENT X532

PATIENT X532
Yes.

DOCTOR X532
How about after dinner?  After you @@@ then you take your insulin before dinner?

PATIENT X532
Right I take the regular, short-acting one at that time.

DOCTOR X532
Short-act okay.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
And then do you measure it ever after dinner, after you take your short-acting.

PATIENT X532

DOCTOR X532
Okay but you don't know what it is?

PATIENT X532
Right and I @@@ check it later.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  You need to write it down for me.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  They didn't check your blood sugar today did they?

PATIENT X532
No.

DOCTOR X532
Yeah.  So we should check your blood sugar real quick.

PATIENT X532
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR X532
I think we need to recheck your A1c as well.

PATIENT X532
Right uh-huh.  @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Well I'm sure it is.  Okay you seem to know that.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
The question is can we increase your Glargine, the nighttime insulin a little bit.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Uh.

PATIENT X532
I know @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Oh.

PATIENT X532
An egg taste in my mouth.

DOCTOR X532
An egg taste in your mouth?

PATIENT X532
Yeah not regular @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Are you not taking it at all?

PATIENT X532
What?

DOCTOR X532
How many times a week do you ditch your Glargine?

PATIENT X532
Uh I take it every day.

DOCTOR X532
Okay well how many times have you missed it?  I know you try.

PATIENT X532
@@@ I missed it maybe @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Let's get you a glucose monitor test.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Alright let me just check your blood sugar alright.  

PATIENT X532
Let me do that.

DOCTOR X532
You want to do it?

PATIENT X532
Yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X532
@@@ one of these.

PATIENT X532
@@@.  

DOCTOR X532
@@@ finger there.

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
There you go.

PATIENT X532
Is that it?  That's @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Yeah, that's it.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Not bad.

PATIENT X532
@@@.  120 and under.

DOCTOR X532
That's good; I mean it should be when you wake up in the morning.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
That's what we, now if you take your Glargine at night when you wake up in the morning it needs to kind of 120 or under.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Now what did you eat today?

PATIENT X532
Uh well @@@.

DOCTOR X532
What have you eaten today?

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
What time?

PATIENT X532
Around 12 noon.

DOCTOR X532
Did you @@@ before that?

PATIENT X532
Yes.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  So it's about 4 o'clock now.

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
Okay so it's just four hours post prandially so it still might be a little bit high.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Um.  Maybe what we can do is we can check your A1c.  If your A1c is really high.

PATIENT X532
Yeah.

DOCTOR X532
Uh then maybe I could give you a call and I could tell you to just increase your Glargine.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Um but if it's high then we can keep it as is okay.  We just made a change recently so you said it's still high.  Your morning blood sugars are still high.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Right.

PATIENT X532
Well then before I had, I had one low.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
I had one low level @@@ 98.

DOCTOR X532
Those are great.

PATIENT X532
Right.  @@@ before, before they increased it.

DOCTOR X532
Before the change.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
You said since the change your sugars have been higher?

PATIENT X532
Right.  And I was thinking uh that the Glargine is the long-acting, 20 and then I was taking uh the 70/30.

DOCTOR X532
Yeah.

PATIENT X532
I was taking 80 and 80.

DOCTOR X532
Oh.

PATIENT X532
Of that.

DOCTOR X532
Right.

PATIENT X532
And uh @@@ cause it was lower @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Mine, but the 70/30.  Before, you were taking your blood sugar, you thought your blood sugar was more controlled with the 70/30 and the Glargine?

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  So but what we just need to do is titrate up or increase what you're on now.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Right.  Uh it's a little bit of a better you know regimen.

PATIENT X532
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR X532
So let me see.  I think we'll check the A1c today.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
And kind of see where it's at.  I think if you're taking the 24 with meals and you're taking 20 at night before you go to bed.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
And your blood sugars in the morning are still high; they're still very high right?

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Um we should.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
You're doing a lot of pop.

PATIENT X532
Well not, no maybe one.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.  Do you want to quit that?

PATIENT X532
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.

PATIENT X532
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  Um let's do that.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Well it's tough for me to really know what to change when I don't see the blood sugar records okay.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Let's take a look at your A1c; if it's still high then we'll consider increasing your Glargine to.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Probably we'll probably do that.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
I need to know also what your blood sugars are a couple hours after you eat and when you take the insulin with it because we need to make sure that that insulin, okay is accurate.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
So again, bring in your blood glucose log in a month.

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
We want to know what the morning is and we also want to know what it is two hours after you give yourself insulin in the evening.

PATIENT X532
Right, right.

DOCTOR X532
Those are important to know.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Right so we need to know if we need to increase the dose.

PATIENT X532
Right @@@ it's pretty accurate.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  I'm going to be right back okay.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
To what?

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
I don't know if I need to take a look at what else is going on.

PATIENT X532
Right here.

DOCTOR X532
This is the part that's the problem okay.  And they're being a little bit more stringent with us.  Cannot walk 200 feet without stopping to rest does no longer qualify them for disability.

PATIENT X532
I see.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
So I don't think because you can walk okay.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Right?

PATIENT X532
Right.  @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Yeah but I don't think unless there is one of the following conditions okay.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Lung disease which I don't think you have.

PATIENT X532
No.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Right uh you don't have a heart condition.

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Uh you walk on your own; you don't have an assistive device.  You don't have @@@ or orthopedic condition that's severe right.  So I don't know if you necessarily qualify.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.  Let's hope you don't.

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Alright, hold on one second okay.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:35  DOCTOR IN:  63:47)

DOCTOR X532
Alright.

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
Yeah so I think what we're gonna do is if you take your blood sugars in the morning and they're still high in the 200s.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
We want to increase your nighttime insulin.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
So we're going to increase it from 20 to 25.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
You know what you need to do if you feel low blood sugars right?

PATIENT X532
Yes.

DOCTOR X532
I want you to then come down.  If you get low blood sugars in the morning.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
I want you to come down back to 20.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.  So you're gonna be taking Glargine 20.

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
And then the long-acting.  At night, tell me what you're taking, tell me what you're gonna be taking.

PATIENT X532
@@@ 24.

DOCTOR X532
Yep.

PATIENT X532
And @@@ 24, then 25 at bedtime.

DOCTOR X532
Alright.

PATIENT X532
Yeah.

DOCTOR X532
Good.

PATIENT X532
Good.

DOCTOR X532
Today you're gonna go to the Lab.

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
You're gonna get a couple lab tests.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
And then I'm going to put in for the colonoscopy okay.

PATIENT X532
Okay.  When will I see you again?

DOCTOR X532
Uh you want to come back in a couple of months?  That sound okay?

PATIENT X532
Yeah.  @@@ primary care doctor.

DOCTOR X532
DOCTOR.  Uh it's just very helpful if I could have that.

PATIENT X532
Right exactly @@@.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  Are you taking aspirin?

PATIENT X532
Yes.

DOCTOR X532
You are taking aspirin?

PATIENT X532
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  So you're not taking any other blood thinners?  No Coumadin, no Plavix right?

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
You don't have a prosthetic heart valve, no pacemaker?

PATIENT X532
No.

DOCTOR X532
No valve damage.  You don't have oxygen at home?

PATIENT X532

Uh and you have used heroin right?

PATIENT X532
Yes.

DOCTOR X532
How about recently?

PATIENT X532
@@@.

DOCTOR X532
Have you had surgery on the belly before?

PATIENT X532
No.

DOCTOR X532
And no radiation to your belly that you know of.

PATIENT X532
No.

DOCTOR X532
No problems with anesthesia or sedation in the past?

PATIENT X532
No.

DOCTOR X532
Are you, you are taking insulin, diabetic medication yeah.

PATIENT X532
(Patient answers phone call on his cell phone).

DOCTOR X532
Okay so that order was placed okay and then the Lab, you go straight over to the Lab okay.

PATIENT X532
Okay.

DOCTOR X532
You need any medications today?

PATIENT X532
No, I'm supposed to get some of that in the mail @@@.

DOCTOR X532
I can certainly get you; you said mail the test strips?

PATIENT X532
Right.

DOCTOR X532
Sure.  We should probably renew all of your @@@.  Alright so mail okay, you want them mailed?

PATIENT X532
Yes.

DOCTOR X532
Okay.  Um you're good to go.

PATIENT X532

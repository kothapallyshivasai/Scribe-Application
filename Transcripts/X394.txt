DOCTOR X394
Hello.

PATIENT X394
Hi, good to see you.

DOCTOR X394
Nice to see you, come on back here.  

PATIENT X394
How are you?

DOCTOR X394
Doing okay?

PATIENT X394
Okay, how are you?

DOCTOR X394
Good, yeah good to see you again.  @@@.

PATIENT X394
Yeah that's too long yeah.

DOCTOR X394
You doing fine on the @@@.

PATIENT X394
@@@.

DOCTOR X394
Oh great.

PATIENT X394
@@@.

DOCTOR X394
Why is that?  @@@.

PATIENT X394
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X394
Oh do you take his vitals?

SECOND PERSON X394
Oh no I watch them.

DOCTOR X394
Okay, okay.

SECOND PERSON X394
They gave us.  They were @@@ I think it was like in the @@@.

DOCTOR X394
Right, right.  Um tell me about the arm.

PATIENT X394
Well we don't get that, it's like static, @@@ from switching over in my arms but it seems like to me I feel like the bottom of it here, it usually feels fuller from here on up @@@.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.

PATIENT X394
But it seems like the slower you get, but suddenly here is especially where it hurts me.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.  Does it come; do you get pain in your neck at all?  No.
So it's just @@@ the arm.

PATIENT X394
But once I turn my head it'll go away.

DOCTOR X394
Oh I remember that from last time.

PATIENT X394
Remember.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh.

PATIENT X394
And they cancelled my appointment and I've been trying to call them to see if they'd give me another appointment and they never return my calls.

DOCTOR X394
Appointment with who?

PATIENT X394
Well for my arms.

DOCTOR X394
With the physical therapist, is that what it was?

PATIENT X394
Right.

DOCTOR X394
I remember.  I do, I know it was something with your arm and now I remember you saying when you bend that way is what makes it better.

PATIENT X394
@@@.

DOCTOR X394
@@@ I don't know why.  Alright well we'll re-set it up.  I'm sorry; I don't know why that happens.

PATIENT X394
I called them twice and twice they never answered me.  Never gave me a return call.  Try to find out cause I thought maybe that's what you wanted to know.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah, that's the one thing.  What we do is uh help us decide where the um you know where the nerve is obstructed so.

PATIENT X394
Right.

DOCTOR X394
You're having and I think we talked about it last time, but you're having this sensation like electrical sensation down there.

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
Right and um you know we know that you have like problems with the back.

PATIENT X394
Right.

DOCTOR X394
But usually most of the time @@@ down here, not as much up here.

PATIENT X394
No right.

DOCTOR X394
Um and you know you're symptoms are limited, kind of like here to here.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
So I don't know exactly where the problem is, so I wanted to do that test to see and I'm not sure why.  Of course they don't give any information, it just says will reschedule.

PATIENT X394
I tried to explain it to them that I'm seeing you today.

DOCTOR X394
Right.

PATIENT X394
And I'm sure you want to know the results.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah.

PATIENT X394
I thought I was coming here for nothing you know.

DOCTOR X394
Right.

PATIENT X394
Then I could get the results.

DOCTOR X394
Oh yeah.  So you probably coming here for nothing but definitely it's not your fault.  I'm glad you tried um you know, just it's unfortunately sometimes the way the system works.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
And I don't know if they've ever perfectly fixed it but I'll try to reschedule it again.

PATIENT X394
Okay.

DOCTOR X394
And we'll see if we can get you done um cause it's hard for me to know exactly what's the best way to treat it.  You know take this off, let me examine it again okay.  Otherwise things are good?

PATIENT X394
Yeah.  It hurts like heck in the morning you know.  I get up and there's a lot of pain when I walk but after I walk for a while it'll go away.

DOCTOR X394
Once you're up yeah.

PATIENT X394
Do you want me to sit? @@@.

DOCTOR X394
Okay so the pain is, it starts down here and shoots up right?

PATIENT X394
Down in here and then here.  Right here, for some reason it bothers me.

DOCTOR X394
That's what you were saying you feel like it can get a little swollen and stuff.

PATIENT X394
If feels that way yeah.

DOCTOR X394
Does it hurt when I push on it?

PATIENT X394
No it didn't, it does sometimes but.

DOCTOR X394
But not right now.

PATIENT X394
No I can feel it there.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.  Is it like tender?

PATIENT X394
No it's just, @@@. But just right in here is where it bothers me.  Right now it's not @@@ there.

DOCTOR X394
Right in there huh.

PATIENT X394
Right there.

DOCTOR X394
Now it's only this arm right, it's not the left arm.

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
It's not in your legs.

PATIENT X394
Just the one arm.  I fell down about three months ago and it didn't bother me and then all of a sudden about two or three weeks later is when all this started.  I don't know if that's what did it.

DOCTOR X394
How'd you fall?

PATIENT X394
I fell down two flights of stairs @@@.

DOCTOR X394
Wow how'd you do that?

PATIENT X394
I fell right on here.  I hit the wall you know with my arm but it didn't bother me.

DOCTOR X394
Was it hurting you before then?  Before you fell?

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
So after you fell was when that started?

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
Oh that's a new piece of information okay.

PATIENT X394
Right.

DOCTOR X394
So how did you, what made you fall?

PATIENT X394
Well I was coming out of the washroom and I have two steps coming out and down and one going up and I forgot about them steps and I you know, without @@@.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.

PATIENT X394
I fell up against the wall.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.  So you kind of bumped that shoulder and that arm into the wall.

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
And since then is when you've been having the pain?

PATIENT X394
Well maybe a week after that.  It didn't bother me at so I didn't do nothing till it bothered me.

DOCTOR X394
Okay hmm, that's interesting.  Um I don't know that it helped me figure out what it is but it's interesting and that's probably something to do with that.  Um squeeze my fingers good.  Now pull me towards you good.  Push me to the left.  So I'm just checking you know for strength @@@ for the triceps, pushing with the triceps, squeezing to make sure that you have @@@.  Your strength is really good, it's the same on both sides and that's kind of the easiest way to tell.  You know @@@ from side to side, especially since this arm @@@ seemed to be bothering you.  Um okay and uh sleeping doesn't or @@@ straight chair wasn't causing pain with pronation, supination, nothing we can do to make it worse when we do that huh.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
When I let you pull and then push back anything to make it worse?

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.

PATIENT X394
And usually when it starts is when I'm sitting @@@ like this here.  As soon as I take it off @@@ it'll go away.

DOCTOR X394
Right.

PATIENT X394
And if I leave my arm long enough it'll start, that'll start.

DOCTOR X394
No swelling?

PATIENT X394
@@@.

DOCTOR X394
No swelling in your face or neck or anything like that basically?

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.  Um no headaches?

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
Okay um when you turn and look away.

PATIENT X394
No this way.

DOCTOR X394
See one thing @@@ is I don't know if you've gotten to @@@ but they go up this.  Um now @@@.

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
@@@ sensation where you get crossing nerves that comes out of the spinal cord um well they need to come down the arm.  I'm gonna, this is for both of your @@@.  But basically the nerves will come out and they come down the arms and they go to different places um to your biceps, to your triceps to the muscles here to your hand and it's what allows you to move all this stuff as well as feel sensation there okay.  If even when you fell, if you kind of pulled this area you can pull muscles there but you can also actually kind of strain the nerves in that area.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
And that can cause a problem um.  I don't know if that's part of what's going on.  Um it would maybe explain why when you move your neck you can get it in a position that it feels better.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
Um but again the best way would maybe be to do the needle test so that's you know um but this isn't getting any better on its own.

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
Is it getting worse or it's just the same?

PATIENT X394
Well it's the same but it bothers me at night you know.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah that's @@@.

PATIENT X394
And it wakes me up.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah um and you're taking Tylenol which is what you normally take right?

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
Does that help this pain at all?

PATIENT X394
Yes it does.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.  Alright well I guess if it helps.  Does it at least, does it make it more tolerable and help you sleep a little bit better?

PATIENT X394
Uh yeah if I take the Tylenol but I always take one before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X394
Right.

PATIENT X394
And I don't want to take another when I get up you know.

DOCTOR X394
So really you're only taking right now is the one before you go to bed?

PATIENT X394
I take two.

DOCTOR X394
Two before you go to bed.

PATIENT X394
In the morning on account of my back I'll take one and then one before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X394
Okay, okay.  Um I guess um if you think that that's working for now, I'd say we could stick with that until we get the test and see if that helps us figure it out.

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
The other thing we could do is we could either try a little bit more Tylenol, which would be okay, you're not taking that much.  We could even go up to.

PATIENT X394
@@@.

DOCTOR X394
We could give you three before you go to bed, would be okay with those two pills if you want or we could even try some Tylenol with codeine if you thought you wanted to try that which would be a little bit stronger mixed with Tylenol with codeine which is kind of a lighter narcotic agent.

PATIENT X394
Okay.

DOCTOR X394
And maybe give you a little bit more pain medication until we have a better idea of what's going on.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
Would you want to try that?

PATIENT X394
Yes I'll try it.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.

PATIENT X394
I can.

DOCTOR X394
Okay, alright um but during the day you're able to do everything you need to do?

PATIENT X394
Yeah that's normal.

DOCTOR X394
Um okay.  But you don't feel weak or anything, it's really just the.

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
Pain okay.  How about um just before sleeping if you maybe are able to put the pillows a certain way to keep your head in that position would that help?

PATIENT X394
Hmm yeah if I sleep on this side it'll pull my head this way but @@@ I'm leaning on this.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.  So we've never really done an x-ray right?

PATIENT X394
No not of my arm @@@.

SECOND PERSON X394
@@@.

DOCTOR X394
Um and you have no pain in the shoulder here right?

PATIENT X394
No.

DOCTOR X394
So lift your arm, no pain doing that?

PATIENT X394
You know when it bothers me when I'm combing my hair or I'm shaving, that's when it really catches when I'm doing that yeah.  When I comb my hair or shave then it really starts.

DOCTOR X394
@@@ one of the nerves that comes in here is being pinched somewhere, whether it's at the shoulder or somewhere at the bicep or in the neck, I'm not totally sure where.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
You know cause it seems like certain motions now.

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
Put your neck like this, put your arm up, something that is pushing it is pinching the nerve um.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
Um so imaging would help us figure out which nerve it is and then the next step would be what can we do about it so.

PATIENT X394
Okay.

DOCTOR X394
Um to be honest with you I don't know if there's gonna be a perfect answer for that.  I don't know, even once we get the results if I'm gonna be able to say okay now that I know, I know how to fix it.

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
And I might not be able to but at least it might give us an idea.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
So let me talk to DOCTOR.  Everything else is good.  We're good with refills and everything?

PATIENT X394
Well I need lisinopril.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.

PATIENT X394
The other ones I got for a couple more weeks.

DOCTOR X394
Whatever you need is okay.  I'll just have them mailed to you when it runs out?

PATIENT X394
Yes that's good.  I think I got enough for like ten days.  I don't know if they all have to be reordered anyway.

DOCTOR X394
I think I did all the others it looks like last time but we'll check and see if you need that one, okay they're refilled.  @@@ a 90 day supply.  Okay I'll be right back alright.

PATIENT X394
Okay.

DOCTOR X394
You can put your shirt back on.

PATIENT X394
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:56  DOCTOR IN:  45:37)

DOCTOR X394
Alright, so um DOCTOR and I were talking a little bit.  Um I think it makes sense to do it slow, you know cause we just have to find out what it is but kind of like I was saying I don't know for sure that we're gonna be able to fix it once we know.

PATIENT X394
Hmm.

DOCTOR X394
But my thought is I'd like to find out and then we can go from there.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
Um see if it helps.  Um instead of going up on the Tylenol he recommended trying a medicine at night that will maybe help a little bit with sleep but it also gives a neuropathic pain effect.  I other words it gives you pain relief with nerve pain and that's what we think this is.  We think this is an irritation of the nerve.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
Um and it gives some help with that so I probably instead of increasing do the Tylenol with codeine and we'll try that to see if it helps.

PATIENT X394
It's not going to interfere with aspirin is it?

DOCTOR X394
Nope doesn't interfere with the aspirin at all um.

PATIENT X394
So right now I take, sometimes I take three pills when my back aches and then once I get up in the morning it hurts but after I walk for a while it'll go away excepting if I walk @@@.  Like when I go shopping.

DOCTOR X394
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X394
I get a burning sensation right here.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah and that's what.  When you lean over @@@ push the cart does that make it feel a little better, does that help?

PATIENT X394
I hang on to them yeah.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah and that's just @@@ find some answers that we know you have.

PATIENT X394
And I can't stand in one place too long that's when it really burns.

DOCTOR X394
Right exactly and that's because when you're standing, around the spinal cord where the area is tight and then it really starts squeezing on that cord and it has, just like we're talking about the nerves up here.

PATIENT X394
Yeah.

DOCTOR X394
The same thing with the nerves going through your legs um and you know, there's not great options with these things unfortunately.  You know we can do surgery um but right.

PATIENT X394
If I could, you know when I walk, it's always the same it's just that you know when I can't tolerate the pain then we might have to do an operation on it but I can live with it.  I've had it for a long time so.

DOCTOR X394
Alright so we'll try this medicine desipramine it's called okay.  Uh we'll just start with a real small dose, the lowest dose.  Just take one time at night.

PATIENT X394
Okay.

DOCTOR X394
Take it with the Tylenol.  It might make you a little sleepy, so I would definitely start you know just taking it before you go to bed and see how it makes you feel.

PATIENT X394
I can take it with Tylenol?

DOCTOR X394
You can take it with the Tylenol.

PATIENT X394
And an aspirin?

DOCTOR X394
Uh-huh, no problem, definitely won't hurt with aspirin.

PATIENT X394
Cause I take one before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X394
Yeah that's perfect, you can take it together and um um and so it might make you a little sleepy.  Um it'll take a little while, a week or two probably before we would see any affect on the pain @@@.  Because it takes a little time to build up in your system.

PATIENT X394
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X394
Uh but we'll see if it has any affect on this pain especially at night okay.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
And we'll, you know it can be a little trial and error.  We'll see what works and what doesn't work.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
And then I put in for them to reschedule the test.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
Okay and I'll see you back in a couple months and we'll see how things are going.

PATIENT X394
Great.

DOCTOR X394
Alright.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
That's it.

PATIENT X394
Now I can report at the desk.

DOCTOR X394
No I'll do it all through the computer.

PATIENT X394
Okay.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.

PATIENT X394
Thank you very much.

DOCTOR X394
Good to see you.  Have a good holiday.

PATIENT X394
@@@ you too.  Nice seeing you.

DOCTOR X394
Good luck to you.

SECOND PERSON X394
Alright thank you.

DOCTOR X394
I'll have them just mail you this medicine so you don't have to worry about it.

PATIENT X394
Alright.

DOCTOR X394
Okay.  Sounds great.  @@@.

PATIENT X394

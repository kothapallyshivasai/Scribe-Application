 
DOCTOR X210

PATIENT X210
How are you doctor?

DOCTOR X210
Good, how are you sir?

PATIENT X210
Fine.  It's been a while since I've been here.

DOCTOR X210
It's been a while, sorry to keep you waiting.

PATIENT X210
Well I had to cancel twice before so I'm kind of running out of prescriptions.

DOCTOR X210
Oh sure.  No problem.

PATIENT X210
I made it a point to make it for this one.

DOCTOR X210
Well thanks and I'm sorry but we had some add-ons today.  One of the other doctors had to cancel their clinic so it backed me up just a little bit.

PATIENT X210
Okay.

DOCTOR X210
Let me get your chart over here.

PATIENT X210
Okay.

DOCTOR X210
How have you been?

PATIENT X210
I've been fine so far.

DOCTOR X210
Good.

PATIENT X210
So far so good.  Putting a lot of hours as a banker.  Averaging anywhere from 55-60 hours a week so.

DOCTOR X210
Wow, that's a lot.

PATIENT X210
A lot of standing.  Yeah.

DOCTOR X210
But it's nice to have a job.

PATIENT X210
That's true.

DOCTOR X210
Um cause you uh, that's a lot of work for a retired.

PATIENT X210
Yeah well twice I did retire.

DOCTOR X210
Yeah.

PATIENT X210
But I went back to work.  I got tired of sitting around.  Only so much painting and fishing you could do.

DOCTOR X210
Well you probably, you know people that have things to do live longer.

PATIENT X210
That's true.  If you're going to be a couch potato you're going to be dead in a year.  You got to keep moving.

DOCTOR X210
Alright.  So I saw you last February is that right?

PATIENT X210
Correct.

DOCTOR X210
Alright and let's see what we did for you then.

PATIENT X210
Oh you gave me a flu shot and I got another one today.

DOCTOR X210
Good.  And you had your eyes checked?

PATIENT X210
Yep.  @@@.

DOCTOR X210
Every thing’s okay?

PATIENT X210
Every thing’s fine so far.  I got an appointment to see him February the 23rd.

DOCTOR X210
Okay good.  Alright and let's see here.  So you've had bypass surgery.

PATIENT X210
Yes.

DOCTOR X210
Uh high blood pressure?

PATIENT X210
Yes.

DOCTOR X210
That's about it.

PATIENT X210
That's it.

DOCTOR X210
About right?

PATIENT X210
Right no heart attacks, uh no strokes that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR X210
Good.  Good, alright.

PATIENT X210
I'm pushing the big side of the 8 come September.

DOCTOR X210
Good deal.  When did you have your bypass, how old were you?

PATIENT X210
Uh 98, I was in my 60s I believe, 65.

DOCTOR X210
Did you have a heart attack?

PATIENT X210
Nope.  Never had a heart attack.

DOCTOR X210
Good.

PATIENT X210
No stroke that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR X210
Right you just told me that.

PATIENT X210
Yeah.

DOCTOR X210
Alright and your blood pressure is a little high today it looks like.

PATIENT X210
Yes.  Uh I have a monitor at home and I've been getting, like I said anywhere between 160 and 180.  Uh sometimes it'll drop down to 150/60, you know so it depends.

DOCTOR X210
Hmm.  And we have you taking four medications?

PATIENT X210
Yes.  I've got them all with me here, simvastatin, @@@, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and losartan.

DOCTOR X210
Losartan yeah.

PATIENT X210
Uh the one that I don't need and I got plenty of is gemfibrozil.

DOCTOR X210
Gemfibrozil?

PATIENT X210
Yeah.  I got two of them but right now I'm low on simvastatin @@@.

DOCTOR X210
Okay.

PATIENT X210
But we can order them I guess through the.

DOCTOR X210
You want them through the mail?

PATIENT X210
Yeah you can go through the mail or either I can pick them up tonight if you want.

DOCTOR X210
Whatever you want.

PATIENT X210
Well I'll pick them up tonight if they have them ready.  How long will it take them, about an hour?

DOCTOR X210
I don't know, it depends on how many people are down there.  Whatever you want and is convenient for you.

PATIENT X210
Well I have nothing to do so I can sit down there and wait I guess.  But since I met with you, my son one went down to @@@ in March my son had a slight heart attack.

DOCTOR X210
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.

PATIENT X210
They did a bypass and what do you call those stents, put two stents in.

DOCTOR X210
That's good.

PATIENT X210
Two stents, yeah he's doing fine now.

DOCTOR X210
Oh that's good.

PATIENT X210
But he's on the same blood pressure medication and all that.

DOCTOR X210
How old is he?

PATIENT X210
The youngest son is 50.

DOCTOR X210
That's early to have a heart attack.

PATIENT X210
Right.  Right, it runs in the family yeah.

DOCTOR X210
Yeah, yeah.  Alright let's see what we got for you.

PATIENT X210
See my brother had one; of course he's passed away now what six years, seven years.  

DOCTOR X210
So your cholesterol looks good.

PATIENT X210
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X210
Um.

PATIENT X210
What's the cholesterol reading?

DOCTOR X210
Well that was a year ago so I may need to repeat that soon.  I don't think we need to today.  Um you've probably eaten, you've eaten today?

PATIENT X210
Yeah well I cheated today, I had a hot dog and uh tamales, which I shouldn't have, I know.

DOCTOR X210
What I'll do is I'm going to order a fasting cholesterol test for you.  You can come back anytime to do it, there's no rush okay.  Your cholesterol looks great.

PATIENT X210
Okay.

DOCTOR X210
Um and when you do come back and get the other lab I'm going to order as well.  

PATIENT X210
Okay.

DOCTOR X210
This just checks on your kidney functions.

PATIENT X210
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X210
Which we need to keep an eye on because of your blood pressure.

PATIENT X210
Right.

DOCTOR X210
Well I'll have you sit over there.

PATIENT X210
Alright.

DOCTOR X210
Okay.  Check your blood pressure there.

PATIENT X210
Okay, what's with the.

DOCTOR X210
We'll try it.

PATIENT X210
Alright.

DOCTOR X210
We'll try it.

PATIENT X210
She did the last time.

DOCTOR X210
We'll be consistent then.

PATIENT X210
Yeah.

DOCTOR X210
Are you a Bears fan?

PATIENT X210
Not really.

DOCTOR X210
Yeah.

PATIENT X210
But if they make it past this one then they deserve it.

DOCTOR X210
There you go.  If they can beat xxx right?

PATIENT X210
Right.  I've been betting against them all year.  At the time I bet with them they lost.

DOCTOR X210
That's right.  Lift up on the elbow a little bit.

PATIENT X210
Okay.

DOCTOR X210
There you go.  If you're flexed it'll make it seem higher.

PATIENT X210
Yeah.

DOCTOR X210
Okay that's better.  It says 130.

PATIENT X210
130 yeah it came down quite a bit.

DOCTOR X210
Yeah.

PATIENT X210
Yeah.

DOCTOR X210
But at home though, at home it's 150s you said?

PATIENT X210
Well I usually take it at night and I shouldn't do that, I should take it earlier in the day but I'm working during the days and these hours are something like 10 1/2 hours at the bank.

DOCTOR X210
That's a lot.

PATIENT X210
Right and by the time I get home, that's the only time I can take it is at night.

DOCTOR X210
Yeah it's probably not the best time to read it.

PATIENT X210
Right and it's at night so.

DOCTOR X210
What time do you get up in the morning?

PATIENT X210
I get up at 5 in the morning.

DOCTOR X210
What time do you go to work?

PATIENT X210
I'll be there before 8.

DOCTOR X210
Could you take it before you leave for work?

PATIENT X210
I could take that in the morning yeah sure.

DOCTOR X210
I wouldn't do it the first time.

PATIENT X210
No I wouldn't either because you got to get the blood circulating.

DOCTOR X210
So do you have breakfast?

PATIENT X210
Well I have a banana usually, I don't eat too much for breakfast.

DOCTOR X210
Okay, so get up, have your banana and coffee, whatever.  Do you take coffee?

PATIENT X210
Yeah.

DOCTOR X210
Caffeine?

PATIENT X210
Uh yeah regular coffee black.

DOCTOR X210
How early do you have that after getting up?  First thing or?

PATIENT X210
Oh maybe about 5:10, maybe 5:15, we got the timer on the coffee pot so if it's not on I'll turn it on.  @@@.

DOCTOR X210
So why don't you get up in the morning um.

PATIENT X210
Yeah.

DOCTOR X210
Wash your face or whatever you do and then uh take your blood pressure and then have your coffee.

PATIENT X210
Alright, sounds good.

DOCTOR X210
Hang tight for me; um I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X210
Alright.  I won't have to take a number down there for the prescriptions will I?

DOCTOR X210
I don't think so.

PATIENT X210
@@@.

DOCTOR X210
I've already put the order in and I think you just have to go down there.

PATIENT X210
Alright.

DOCTOR X210
Um and when was your last colonoscopy?  Do you know?

PATIENT X210
Hmm maybe three years ago.

DOCTOR X210
Here?

PATIENT X210
No, I got it at a doctor's office.  They had a doctor and I can't remember his name now.

DOCTOR X210
Do you smoke?

PATIENT X210
Oh I quit in '94.  '84, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR X210
What about alcohol, do you use alcohol?

PATIENT X210
I have a drink maybe occasionally once a week, a beer or maybe a highball or something.

DOCTOR X210
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X210
But nothing daily.

DOCTOR X210
Uh-huh.  Okay.  And then let's see, did they do the neck exam?  It's ENT.

PATIENT X210
Uh they did it here I believe.

DOCTOR X210
Let's see here.  Yeah.

PATIENT X210
They said something about it was going the other way cause I had one of the arteries was done on the right side and I think it's working good I guess.  The other side I guess is blocked.

DOCTOR X210
And you saw the Peripheral Vascular surgeons?

PATIENT X210
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X210
And they wanted to see you in one year, do you have an appointment with them, let's see.  Sure.  You're just supposed to follow up with the vascular surgeon within the next couple months.

PATIENT X210
Okay.

DOCTOR X210
Okay.

PATIENT X210
That's that uh sound test again?

DOCTOR X210
Yeah I think they're going to check to make sure they don't need to do anything because it was.

PATIENT X210
They said there was nothing they could do.

DOCTOR X210
Huh.

PATIENT X210
That's what he told me the last time, so that's why I didn't.  I figured well it was working on one side, it's good enough.  When I shut down it's through.

DOCTOR X210
Okay.  

PATIENT X210
But he said he got a good sound on my right side so.

DOCTOR X210
Good deal.  Almost done, I just got to look up.

PATIENT X210
Uh-huh oh yeah.

DOCTOR X210
I got a new warning on gemfibrozil.  I want to make sure I don't miss something on that.

PATIENT X210
Uh-huh.  Well I'm just taking a half a tablet every night before bed along with the other uh simvastatin.

DOCTOR X210
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X210

Your pressures, you know if they're in the 150s and I get low 130s today but we probably need yours lower given how the extensive disease you've had.

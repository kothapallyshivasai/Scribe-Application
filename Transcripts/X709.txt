PATIENT X709
Oh not so bad I guess.

DOCTOR X709
Alright.  Let me bring you up here.  Uh when did I see you last here, August huh?  Over the summertime.

PATIENT X709
It was the last visit with you?

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Yes it was about that time.

DOCTOR X709
Around four or four and a half months maybe.  

PATIENT X709
Yeah.

DOCTOR X709
How have things been going at home?

PATIENT X709
Oh pretty well.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
I have some problems stemming from my childhood and I wanted, trauma from my childhood.

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X709
And the service too.

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh.  Is that what you're seeing Psychology for?

PATIENT X709
Yes.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.

PATIENT X709
I'm just following with @@@.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.

PATIENT X709
See if they can help me.

DOCTOR X709
Well let's see, how are your medicines doing?

PATIENT X709
Uh they seem to be working alright.  I take uh; I take this saw palmetto, saw palmetto.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT X709
When I have trouble with my urinating and uh.

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X709
I have that problem and it seems to help kind of.

DOCTOR X709
The saw palmetto okay.

PATIENT X709
Yeah.

DOCTOR X709
And uh your inhalers you're still taking?

PATIENT X709
Yes I, I take them as needed I guess.

DOCTOR X709
Well those we want you to be taking all the time.

PATIENT X709
Well the ones at home I uh, the I have two of them at home I take uh.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Let's see there's just this uh machine.

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X709
And then there's the one that uh I forget what it's called right now.

DOCTOR X709
Now there's Symbicort.

PATIENT X709
Symbicort.

DOCTOR X709
That's the one that you take twice a day and there's just one you take once a day.

PATIENT X709
Symbicort, the one that I take once a day seems to be more effective than the one I used to take twice a day.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah I mean they're all good combinations with each other though.

PATIENT X709
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X709
So even though one may make you feel better right away, it's good in the long term to keep using them like that.

PATIENT X709
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X709
They're different types of medicines.

PATIENT X709
Yes.

DOCTOR X709
But you're taking both of those every day?

PATIENT X709
Uh actually I'm only taking one now; I forget the name of it uh, uh right now let's see.  I should have written this down but.

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh.  Yeah um I'd like for you to take all of them though um.  Is there a reason you're not taking the other one?

PATIENT X709
Well it just didn't seem to be very effective and uh so I finally gave it up completely.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.  I'd like you to take both though if you can.

PATIENT X709
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X709
So I think it's the twice a day one you're probably not taking.

PATIENT X709
Yeah.

DOCTOR X709
You didn't bring your medicines with you you said?

PATIENT X709
No I didn't, I should've, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR X709
Okay, okay.  Well today do you need any medicines?  Do you need that inhaler we're talking about or any of your inhalers or your?

PATIENT X709
Well the pocket inhalers I'm pretty well.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Wide with them and the ones at home I had the medication for those too.

DOCTOR X709
And you have the other inhaler, the one you're not using, you have that one still?

PATIENT X709
Yeah, I actually have that yeah.

DOCTOR X709
Okay and then the you know the albuterol one, that one probably you @@@.

PATIENT X709
I'm really not sure just how much of any of those I have left so I haven't used them for quite a while actually.

DOCTOR X709
Okay I'll make sure you have refills of everything.  Do you need anything mailed to you right now?

PATIENT X709
Uh.

DOCTOR X709
It looks like you ran out of your cholesterol pill and all this stuff you haven't been taking for a while.

PATIENT X709
Well the trouble is when they mail the.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Medication if it won't fit in the mailbox I have to drive the ten miles round trip to pick it up at the post office.

DOCTOR X709
Oh.  Your cholesterol pill and your prostate pill, looks like you're not taking those anymore is that right or?

PATIENT X709
Cholesterol.

DOCTOR X709
Cholesterol pill yeah your simvastatin.  You haven't picked those up since June.

PATIENT X709
Simvastatin, yeah I take those on a regular basis I think yes.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.  Okay.  Um okay so it looks like you need refills of that then um.  Let's see, otherwise your breathing's been okay?

PATIENT X709
Pardon?

DOCTOR X709

PATIENT X709
Yeah breathing has been pretty good yeah.

DOCTOR X709
No cough, no chills.

PATIENT X709

PATIENT X709
I cough once in a while but uh.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Not very often.

DOCTOR X709
Are you still using that treadmill or anything like that?

PATIENT X709
No I've got to get back to that I think.  I need to get some, I need to exercise.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.  And you told you used to use the treadmill but you got bored with it after a couple of minutes.

PATIENT X709
Yeah.  I had it rigged up to a TV I could watch but that doesn't work.  I just uh, this what is it, what is it, I was just trying to think of the name of this uh @@@ company.

DOCTOR X709

PATIENT X709
I'm gonna change my, I'd better change my provider for my computer and TV.

DOCTOR X709
Okay, alright um alrighty and you still drinking a couple drinks a day?

PATIENT X709
Maybe one or two.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.

PATIENT X709
I don't have a great craving for alcohol.  Sometimes I these days I, some days I don't even take it to drink a drop.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
I have lots of alcoholic beverages at home.

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh.  And how are you eating at home?

PATIENT X709
I need to improve on that.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.  You used to get that Meals on Wheels right but you didn't feel like you needed it.

PATIENT X709
No that's, yeah I didn't think that worked that well.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.  Yeah your weight is up a little bit so that's good.  It's up about four pounds since I saw you last.

PATIENT X709
I got to get fit.  On here I need to lose that weight, that doesn't really do me any good.  I need to watch my diet.  I need to improve on my diet, eat more of that natural foods and.

DOCTOR X709

PATIENT X709
And not so many processed foods.

DOCTOR X709
You're a couple meals a day though still?

DOCTOR X709
Okay.

PATIENT X709
At least two or three meals.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.  Okay.  Uh and you're still paying all your own bills, getting your own groceries, all that stuff?

PATIENT X709
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X709
Still driving?

PATIENT X709
Yes.

DOCTOR X709
Okay, alright um.  How has your urine been?

PATIENT X709
Uh if I don't take the, uh when I don't take these saw palmettos sometimes I have trouble urinating.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.

PATIENT X709
But that seemed to improve.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.

PATIENT X709
Help me improve but the uh the medications that they.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Prescribed.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
That is not effective.

DOCTOR X709
Is not working hmm.  Uh we could maybe try a different medicine you know.  I mean it sounds like you have an enlarged prostate that's where your urine issues are coming from.

PATIENT X709
Yeah.

DOCTOR X709
Um we could try a different medicine if that one didn't work.

PATIENT X709
Maybe that would be, that might.

DOCTOR X709
And we can mail that to you and see if it'll help, what do you think?

PATIENT X709
Yeah, it might be a good idea yes.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah okay.  Let's see, but you stopped taking that prostate pill though right?

PATIENT X709
Beg pardon?

DOCTOR X709
Are you still taking the prostate pill or did you stop taking that?

PATIENT X709
Uh yeah I'm still taking the ones that are prescribed, all the medication that's been prescribed I take usually.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.  Uh let's see uh I'm just going through your labs here you had last time.  You still see the psychiatrist right?

PATIENT X709
I'm seeing a psychologist.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Somewhat near where I live.

DOCTOR X709
Okay.

PATIENT X709
Psychologist, not a psychiatrist.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.  Alright.

PATIENT X709
The psychiatrist is usually for a little more serious problems I guess aren't they?

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh, yeah, more uh with medication and stuff like that.

PATIENT X709
Yeah.

DOCTOR X709
And you're not smoking anymore right?

PATIENT X709
No I quit smoking.

DOCTOR X709
Did you get the flu shot?

PATIENT X709
Yes I got the flu; I got the flu shot this morning yes.

DOCTOR X709
Oh good.  The nurse just gave it to you?  Alright and let me see what else today, yeah so a few of the things, one we'll try a different prostate pill and then I want you to take both of those inhalers.

PATIENT X709
Yes okay.

DOCTOR X709
Okay one is twice a day and one is once a day and the other one just when you need it that you carry around with you.

PATIENT X709
Yeah, yeah, yeah okay sir.

DOCTOR X709
I think even though you don't feel like it helps you I think it will in the long term help your lungs.  Um, alright your cholesterol you take them uh @@@ get it checked.

PATIENT X709
Sometimes I think quite often you hear it on the TV.

DOCTOR X709
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X709
If the medication makes them, causes them to think about suicide.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
Cause most people, I don't think, think of suicide they start taking some of this medications they prescribe and then it causes them to think about committing suicide for some reason.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
So with medication for psychology and psychiatric problems I don't believe in it anyways.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.  Okay.  

PATIENT X709
Maybe if it's a real serious problem so they might believe that people might think of doing irrational things but maybe uh, maybe some of that medication will just kind of numb them so they won't think about it.

DOCTOR X709
Yeah.

PATIENT X709
It kind of shocked me the one right here if it causes you to think about suicide then they say call us without delay.

DOCTOR X709
Right.  Alright so then let me go talk with my attending doctor and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT X709
Pardon?

DOCTOR X709
Let me talk with the other doctor and I'll be back.

PATIENT X709
Yeah, yeah, okay fine.

DOCTOR X709
Other questions for me or no?

PATIENT X709
Pardon?

DOCTOR X709
Do you have any questions for me or no?

PATIENT X709

DOCTOR X709

PATIENT X709

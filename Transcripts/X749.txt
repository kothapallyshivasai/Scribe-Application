And I so far @@@.

DOCTOR X749
Right.

PATIENT X749
Yeah.

DOCTOR X749
But for your diabetes you need to be on some medication.

PATIENT X749
Oh I understand I just don't want to have the situation where I'm taking you know 12-13 different types of pills.

DOCTOR X749
You won't be.  Um pick-up or mail?

PATIENT X749
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR X749
Pick up your medicine at the window or?

PATIENT X749
Oh you can mail it to me I guess.

DOCTOR X749
Okay.

PATIENT X749
Cause I have other errands that I need to run today.

DOCTOR X749
Okay no problem.  Metformin.

PATIENT X749
You guys have done that before and I think that's pretty cool.

DOCTOR X749
Yeah we're gonna do metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. 

PATIENT X749
Now should I, cause you know I was talking to a friend of mine who also takes metformin and he told me that because I hadn't taken it sometimes for diabetes that you always have to be sure to take it after you eat something.

DOCTOR X749
Yeah you should, on a full stomach cause then you'll feel, you'll get like gas when you eat and all that.

PATIENT X749
Yeah cause that's what the guy was saying you can get a really bad upset stomach.

DOCTOR X749
Yeah.  And glyburide.

PATIENT X749
Yeah glyburide was out.

DOCTOR X749
We'll do 10.

PATIENT X749
I'm pretty sure I can keep it down.  I mean I walk enough, I walk regularly and I've lost about 20 pounds.

DOCTOR X749
That's good.

PATIENT X749
In the last six months or so.

DOCTOR X749
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X749
I mean I don't try to diet or anything like that.

DOCTOR X749
Yeah.

PATIENT X749
But I'm not eating as much processed food and I don't go to those fast food places.

DOCTOR X749
That's good.

PATIENT X749
So I mean I do eat red meat and I tend to eat a lot when I do eat.

DOCTOR X749
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X749
But I really only try to eat meat like one @@@ every day.

DOCTOR X749
Why don't we put you back on the hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure?

PATIENT X749
Okay.

DOCTOR X749
And I'll leave it at that okay and then Naproxen.  The Naproxen you have to take omeprazole with it because it's something for your, it'll upset your stomach.  Okay.

PATIENT X749
Oh you said you could handle the referral so that I could just call and make an appointment with Physical Therapy?

DOCTOR X749
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT X749
That'll save me another trip today.

DOCTOR X749
Okay so we're all set and you're done.

PATIENT X749
So I just take the lab work and then you'll mail me the letter?

DOCTOR X749
Yeah.

PATIENT X749
Okay and I'll have to start taking it today.

DOCTOR X749

PATIENT X749
Oh yeah that'll be fine.

DOCTOR X749
And then.

PATIENT X749

DOCTOR X749

PATIENT X749
Okay but go to the Lab first right?

DOCTOR X749

PATIENT X749
Okay.  Thank you very much.

DOCTOR X749

So then I started one of those, for some reason they determined that I was making enough money so that I could get uh.

DOCTOR X749

PATIENT X749
That's the thing that I really couldn't afford to have it taken out of my income tax.

DOCTOR X749
Oh.

PATIENT X749
About $130 but to me that seemed like a lot.

DOCTOR X749
That is a lot yeah.  That's a lot for me too.

PATIENT X749
So if I call in six different medicines plus the strips and things like that.

DOCTOR X749
Uh-huh yeah.

PATIENT X749
Did you order me more strips by the way as well?  Like along with all the other stuff?

DOCTOR X749
No I didn't, let me put that in.

PATIENT X749
Just so I could have the records, I couldn't tell you what kind of machine I have.

DOCTOR X749
Yeah I'll need to know so I can order the strips correctly.  Um what I would do is I would call.  I would look at the machine and call the pharmacist here and ask what type of machine it is so then they can send me little like reminder to order it.

PATIENT X749
Okay that's fine.

DOCTOR X749
Okay.  Alright.  Take care.

PATIENT X749
Thank you very much.

DOCTOR X749

DOCTOR X650
Alright.  Sorry for the wait.  Uh you came here a little bit early today and usually we're able to sort of squeeze you in sometime but we weren't able to do that today.

PATIENT X650
Okay.

DOCTOR X650
But um so what brings you in here today?

PATIENT X650
Well I uh, somebody scheduled me an appointment and that's all I know.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.

PATIENT X650
And I can tell you what's wrong.

DOCTOR X650
Alright sounds good.

PATIENT X650
Um it's a little, little muscle there.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.

PATIENT X650
It used to be the size of a football right here and now it's just like here right now.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.

PATIENT X650
I think the more I exercise the more it go down.

DOCTOR X650
Oh really.

PATIENT X650
See what happens, I come into the hospital and had a low blood count.

DOCTOR X650
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X650
So they took a bone biopsy right here.

DOCTOR X650
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X650
That paralyzed me all the way down.  So I can't walk right now.  You know I got a walker at home and uh this knee here, where it's got a pin in it, it give me a lot of, it give me a lot of trouble right here in this knee.  It's giving me a lot of trouble.

DOCTOR X650
Uh when did you get the pin in it?

PATIENT X650
Oh.

DOCTOR X650
It's been a while?

PATIENT X650
About 7 years.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.

PATIENT X650
And uh you know the hip, see when I'm trying, like if I want to try to get from here to that desk.

DOCTOR X650
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X650
This will give me a problem and then my hip would give me a problem you know.

DOCTOR X650
And that's what limiting; you're able to move around?

PATIENT X650
Right.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.  See what the uh, looks like, excuse me; you had been in rehab for a little while.

PATIENT X650
In what?

DOCTOR X650
You had been in rehab for a little while.

PATIENT X650
Yeah just a couple three times downstairs. Oh I got to ask you to get me reinstated for the rehab because they're calling me and when they call me I can't get to the phone so three calls they don't call me no more.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.

PATIENT X650
They told me I had to get you to reinstate me.

DOCTOR X650
Alright I can put in another consult for that.  Excuse me.  Um just about done, I need a drink of water.

PATIENT X650
Alright.

DOCTOR X650
To clear my throat.  (Doctor leaves for less than a minute to get some water).  I'm sorry about that.  

PATIENT X650
Alright.

DOCTOR X650
Alright so.  Let's start with your, with your knee and your hip.

PATIENT X650
Right.

DOCTOR X650
Then we can, we'll take a look at it again today and we'll make sure we get you back in place with physical therapy.

PATIENT X650
Alright.

DOCTOR X650
Uh what else has been going on?

PATIENT X650
Oh nothing I just kind of haven't had very much of an appetite but I'm gonna have to work on that you know.

DOCTOR X650
Okay, over what time period did that change?  How long have you noticed that your appetite's low.

PATIENT X650
Well every since I come here in the hospital.  The day I come into the hospital I couldn't eat when I was here.  I weighed 194 pounds and now I'm down to 164.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.

PATIENT X650
So uh when I left the hospital I weighed 174.  Since I've been home I haven't been eating but I got to make some more eating arrangements.  

DOCTOR X650
Okay, alright.  Um so I think uh vitamin supplements to take would be a good idea.

PATIENT X650
Right.

DOCTOR X650
And uh take in whatever you can.

PATIENT X650
Right.

DOCTOR X650
Um definitely good for keeping your energy level up.  Sometimes if you feel more energy you tend to eat more.  It's just kind of a, once it gets going it should help for.

PATIENT X650
Right.

DOCTOR X650
Wanting you to feel like eating.  Um so it looks like if I'm reading everything correctly uh, so I read about your hospitalizations and the rehab.  So then you had a blood, like sort of a hematoma or a big bruise that developed after the biopsy is that what?

PATIENT X650
Well I don't know, you mean this on my leg?

DOCTOR X650
Yeah.

PATIENT X650
Well actually this was like a football, way like this.

DOCTOR X650
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X650
Now it just back of my hand like this.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.  Yeah that was blood there and that's a good thing.  If that was muscle not as goof of a thing so.

PATIENT X650
Yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR X650
I think it probably, from what it sounds like; it was a big hematoma or blood clot that formed there.

PATIENT X650
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X650
And so then your body's slowly going to re-absorb that.

PATIENT X650
Right.  Cause you know since I been trying to get around, you know I been walking with two walking sticks.

DOCTOR X650
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X650
And I got a walker.  So uh I'm doing better.

DOCTOR X650
Okay good.

PATIENT X650
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X650
Um and it looks like next week you have an appointment with the hematologist.

PATIENT X650

PATIENT X650
No, no, the GI tomorrow.

DOCTOR X650
Yeah the 13th.

PATIENT X650

DOCTOR X650

PATIENT X650
Okay.

DOCTOR X650

PATIENT X650
Yes, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.  Let's see if I can find the report here.  Okay.

PATIENT X650
Excuse me.

DOCTOR X650
No problem.  Alright.  So other than the uh pain in your hip and your knee um is there any other thing that's bothered you?

PATIENT X650
No.

DOCTOR X650
No.  Have you been feeling like dizzy when you stand up, that sort of thing?

PATIENT X650
No I was feeling woozy today because I haven't eaten nothing too much.  I ate half of a cheese sandwich, cheese grilled cheese and I ate a honey bun a while ago.  I think and I didn't take all my blood pressure medicines.  But otherwise than that, I been alright.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.  I'm just going to write a few of these things out so I don't forget.  Uh.

PATIENT X650

DOCTOR X650
Um.  So your hemoglobin last week was good, it was 9 1/2, about where it had been.

PATIENT X650

I got to talk to the boss um and uh we'll get you back to therapy and make sure all your medications are up-to-date and uh I think that'll probably about do you for now, so I'll run everything by him and I'll be back in a little bit.

PATIENT X650
Alright, alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  153:4  DOCTOR IN:  170:29)

DOCTOR X650
Sorry about the wait.

PATIENT X650
It's alright.

DOCTOR X650
I had to wade through a lot of your records uh with the boss.  Um but I think we have a pretty good plan.  Your blood pressure is still a little bit elevated today so we're gonna start you on a low dose of lisinopril.  We're going to start you on lisinopril um furosemide or Lasix.

PATIENT X650
I got enough high blood pressure medicine, I just didn't take it.

DOCTOR X650
Oh you just didn't take it?

PATIENT X650
Yeah that why I come expecting that.  How you doing.  See I think it's hard for me to get that.

DOCTOR X650
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X650
So I jumped up so I didn't have time to eat or nothing so what I did, cause I was sick last night so I didn't, I just fell asleep this morning so I took, what is that, start with the I uh, no nifedipine.

DOCTOR X650
Nifedipine okay.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.

PATIENT X650
That ain't the time to take them but I told her what happened.

DOCTOR X650
Uh-huh.

So if I take what I got I'll be alright.

DOCTOR X650
Okay yeah I was confused.  I thought you said that you grabbed a sandwich so you could take your medicine.

PATIENT X650
I did but that was after I was on my way here.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.  So you didn't have all your medications today.

PATIENT X650
No I grabbed the one, I ate half of a sandwich and I took that medication in the car.

DOCTOR X650
Okay.  Alright well that makes me feel a little bit better about where things are.

PATIENT X650
Right.

DOCTOR X650
Um so we can probably hold on making any changes.

PATIENT X650
Right.

DOCTOR X650
Uh we'll just try that.

DOCTOR X650
You got a lot of pills to take.

PATIENT X650
Yeah you know @@@ nifedipine 120 and I got another that's 100, that's a lot of pills.

DOCTOR X650

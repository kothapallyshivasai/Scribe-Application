DOCTOR X594
Hey how you guys doing? 

SECOND PERSON X594
Doing good. 

PATIENT X594
@@@.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah.

PATIENT X594
@@@.

DOCTOR X594
@@@

SECOND PERSON X594
We got the @@@ taken.

DOCTOR X594
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
All the way back here.

PATIENT X594
This is about medication.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.

PATIENT X594
And most of all.

DOCTOR X594
This is it, wherever you want to sit, no you're fine.

PATIENT X594
Most of all it's about blood medications.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.

PATIENT X594
And we did not have the world's best nurse.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.

PATIENT X594
She got 151 over something or other.  I've been taking it at home and I've never gotten that high.

SECOND PERSON X594
She was asking him inappropriate questions.

DOCTOR X594
What was she asking?  Do you mind me asking what she was asking you?

PATIENT X594
Huh?

DOCTOR X594
What was she asking you?

PATIENT X594
She was asking do I ever bathe, did I take a bath this morning.  Can I change my own clothes?  Can I eat by myself?  I've never been asked that and then she kept saying to somebody outside can I go, can I go and then she left.  So I tried to.

DOCTOR X594
They're really focused on what sort of.

PATIENT X594
I told her this is about blood pressure medication and she, you know it was a losing situation.  Just to be sure you might want to your own blood pressure yourself.

DOCTOR X594
I'm gonna tell you my rule for blood pressure with my patients.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
If you're the ones with the trouble are writing all these down every day, I trust the numbers you're taking.  I'll check it again but even if it still comes back high today after that kind of experience my blood pressure would be high right now.

PATIENT X594
Okay.  It just came on by the way.  A couple of months ago we were here for four hours.  We were here till they closed.  She locked the door.

SECOND PERSON X594
Locked us in and left.

PATIENT X594
And then left so then the doctor had to open the door.

SECOND PERSON X594
Try to get the papers.

PATIENT X594
So she would know who she was treating.

SECOND PERSON X594
It's just so different.

PATIENT X594
I'm sure they've got rules here that make it hard to get rid of nurses but.

DOCTOR X594
Oh here, maybe it didn't.

SECOND PERSON X594
@@@ finger in the ear and the nose.

PATIENT X594
Yeah that was weird too.

SECOND PERSON X594
@@@.

DOCTOR X594
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X594
@@@.

PATIENT X594
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

DOCTOR X594
We're kind of getting off.

SECOND PERSON X594
Here is something like.

DOCTOR X594
If it keeps you from getting tired but.

PATIENT X594
Okay here's, I had been taking this for a long time.

DOCTOR X594
I'm going to pull up your chart while you're calming down okay.

PATIENT X594
I was taking this for a long time.

DOCTOR X594
Yes you were, I remember.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.  My systolic its high so then DOCTOR, you know DOCTOR, prescribed this.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X594
So.  I been out of this for about a month.

DOCTOR X594
Do you want me to get it?

PATIENT X594
Just taking this and I'm getting good readings.

SECOND PERSON X594
So maybe you don't need the other one.

DOCTOR X594
I think you know the answer okay.

PATIENT X594
Don't take this anymore.

DOCTOR X594
We'll cancel that and take that one out.

PATIENT X594
Okay.

DOCTOR X594
If you're doing well on this one, this has a @@@ of one day so if you've been taking this every day and it lasts all day and it's keeping your blood pressure fine, less is better is more.  So people actually don't need.

PATIENT X594
Yeah I used to cut them in half but then you told me.

DOCTOR X594
Just take the full thing.

PATIENT X594
Just to take the whole thing.  Okay and so that's.

DOCTOR X594
So you've got a good one that works well for you huh.

PATIENT X594
Uh here's.

DOCTOR X594
And you're breathing one.

PATIENT X594
Now here's the problem.

DOCTOR X594
Is DOCTOR still giving that one?

PATIENT X594
Oh gosh yes.

DOCTOR X594
(Laughter)

PATIENT X594
Uh, did you do this, DOCTOR advice, okay.  You prescribed this because you said it was a better one to take than this.

DOCTOR X594
No so this has a different this.  This has got both in here, albuterol plus ipratropium.

PATIENT X594
Anyway I can't renew this.  They tell me they didn't have it anymore.

DOCTOR X594
Let me look at this for you.  

PATIENT X594
When they told her.  He wanted me to take this one.

DOCTOR X594
Hmm.  Let me read my last notes to jog my memory real quick.  How's your shingles doing?

SECOND PERSON X594
Gone.

PATIENT X594
I had them 30 days.

DOCTOR X594
But it's gone.

PATIENT X594
Yes.

DOCTOR X594
Good, good, good.

SECOND PERSON X594
Well speaking of shingles.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah.  Vaccine.

SECOND PERSON X594
Did they ever get the vaccine?

DOCTOR X594
Of course not.  Why you know would the VA do anything efficiently.

SECOND PERSON X594
So that's really a long time.  They said they would have it by January.

DOCTOR X594
Let me check and see.  I know when I inquired earlier this month they didn't have it, you know what I bet they have.  I just, I usually don't hold my breath for such things.

SECOND PERSON X594
Well obviously you would have been dead a long time.

DOCTOR X594
Alright, let's see.  You're over 60.

PATIENT X594
Yes.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.  I do not expect you to live less than a year.  They actually ask me these questions.  

PATIENT X594
I took a bath today.

DOCTOR X594
You did take a bath.

SECOND PERSON X594
(Laughs)

DOCTOR X594
You don't have any blood cancers.  You're not taking a steroid.

PATIENT X594
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X594
Have you ever had a reaction to gelatin, a medication called neomycin, anything like that?

PATIENT X594
No I don't have a reaction.

SECOND PERSON X594
I don't think he got sick from any medicines that we know of.

DOCTOR X594
Um we need to know if you've ever had tuberculosis disease.

SECOND PERSON X594
No.

PATIENT X594
No.

DOCTOR X594
And you've never had the vaccine before?

PATIENT X594
Which vaccine?

DOCTOR X594
The shingles.

PATIENT X594
No.

SECOND PERSON X594
Yeah.  He gets just the shingle disease.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X594
I thought that the vaccine was new.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah it's been out for like four or five years, maybe a little bit longer.

SECOND PERSON X594
Is it that long?

DOCTOR X594
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X594
I thought it was just this year.  This is the first year I heard of it.

DOCTOR X594
It's becoming to the point where now we go about it differently yeah to get it.

SECOND PERSON X594
@@@.

DOCTOR X594
But before they had it we were just like do we give it, do we not give it, we're not sure, holding back a couple of months and then we'll do that.

SECOND PERSON X594
Okay.  Maybe that's why I didn't know about it.  I had it in 97 when the offered me the vaccine.

DOCTOR X594
Feel that.

SECOND PERSON X594
Right.

DOCTOR X594
You're still indicated to get it even if you had the shingles.

SECOND PERSON X594
I had it in 97 but I @@@ had the shingles.

DOCTOR X594
How about now, did you get the vaccine?

SECOND PERSON X594
Not yet.  I'm gonna ask my doctor about it and I can see.

DOCTOR X594
Let me see uh, uh oh it looks like they may have it at the Pharmacy, so let me put it in, we'll see what happens.

SECOND PERSON X594
@@@.  He could get one dose today when we're done.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah.  Oh okay, here's what happened.  When you saw the pulmonary specialist back in November, okay because this time you didn't see DOCTOR, you saw this guy DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X594
Right.

DOCTOR X594
And another, like @@@ a guy named DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X594
Yeah.

PATIENT X594
We've had Indian doctors, Syrian doctors and a guy we thought was from Turkey.

DOCTOR X594
Okay, you've seen a multitude of.

PATIENT X594
It's always like being @@@.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah so with the last guy DOCTOR he speaks very fast and so this is the way.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah.  He's a German guy.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
And he speaks really fast.  He actually says because he's a lung specialist, I think this one was working well for you.

PATIENT X594
It was.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah but now.

PATIENT X594
And they won't renew it.

DOCTOR X594
Well he just basically said in his notes, he would prefer you to be on this one and not this one.  He thinks this was gonna be better for your cough.

SECOND PERSON X594
And it hasn't been.

PATIENT X594
And you thought this one was.

DOCTOR X594
Which one did you thought worked better for you?

SECOND PERSON X594
We thought the other one.

DOCTOR X594
This one helped you more?

SECOND PERSON X594
Cause now, since he's been on this one, he's never stopped coughing.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah I'm not supposed to go against them because they're the boss but we'll make the change.  I'll write in my note you symptomatically noted that this is better for you and I think between the two, at this point, it's what makes you feel better you know.

SECOND PERSON X594
Yeah.  That's right.

DOCTOR X594
They're not, neither of these are gonna change what's going on inside your lungs, the chronic bronchiectasis, the mass you see, they'll always be there, we just want you to feel better.

PATIENT X594
Okay when you say you're gonna put this in for me.

DOCTOR X594
If you think that they cancelled the order for this.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
That's why you can't get any more of it.

SECOND PERSON X594
He can put it back in.

DOCTOR X594
I can put it back in.

PATIENT X594
Just put it back in.

DOCTOR X594
But I have to get rid of this one and I'll write in my note that we thought this was more beneficial for you and that's why we're switching it back okay.  And before I do that, let me listen to your lungs really good.  Can you take off your shirt?

SECOND PERSON X594
Here.

PATIENT X594
This is more @@@.

SECOND PERSON X594
So give me your @@@.

DOCTOR X594
They have the same power.

PATIENT X594
Oh they do.

DOCTOR X594
This has the exact same power but this has an additional medication in it called ipratropium which works on a different part of your lungs.

PATIENT X594
So why don't we keep that then.

DOCTOR X594
We can keep that if you want this one.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
It's purely up to you.

PATIENT X594
Yeah this one, this one.

DOCTOR X594
It's the same amount of albuterol in both of them.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
So you want this one.

PATIENT X594
Decide on this one.

DOCTOR X594
Okay we'll keep it as the lung doctor suggests.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
I think @@@.

SECOND PERSON X594
So @@@.

PATIENT X594
He's treating our daughter.

DOCTOR X594
Oh is he, over at UIC.

SECOND PERSON X594
Uh-huh.  @@@.

DOCTOR X594
I'm going to check your lungs; can you take a deep breath?  Out.  Good, in and out, in and out.  One more.  @@@.  Any pain here?  Let me see you skin, any new lesions on your skin?

PATIENT X594
No.

DOCTOR X594
You notice anything new?

PATIENT X594
@@@.

DOCTOR X594
They got you a nice high and tight didn't they.

PATIENT X594
That's my son, he's cheap.

DOCTOR X594
And this hasn't changed at all has it, the @@@ on your cheek?

PATIENT X594
I don't know if I, the shingles went on for 30 days.

DOCTOR X594
What about.

SECOND PERSON X594
That was so gradual; I didn't notice what it was.

DOCTOR X594
When was the last time they had to freeze off some of the skin lesions from the Derm Clinic?  Dermatology.  Did they recommend that for you?

SECOND PERSON X594
Oh they did.

DOCTOR X594
The dermatologists freezing off like lesions.

SECOND PERSON X594
He took off something yes.  One time, the last time he went.

DOCTOR X594
Do you check your skin every at least every couple of months, look for new lesions?

PATIENT X594
No I don't.

SECOND PERSON X594
We do once a year or two.

PATIENT X594
No we're just counting on Dermatology to do it.

DOCTOR X594
But you are still seeing them though right?

SECOND PERSON X594
Once a year.

DOCTOR X594
Once a year.  It's better if you do it yourself in between; it's a yearlong type of procedure, only because a lot can happen in a year.

SECOND PERSON X594
Do you think this is @@@.

PATIENT X594
Oh that's probably @@@.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah well.

PATIENT X594
I'll let her do it because I'm a bad spotter.

DOCTOR X594
Alright, you be the spotter okay.

SECOND PERSON X594
Okay.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
Let me see your legs.

PATIENT X594
Yeah spotters huh.

DOCTOR X594
Any swelling?

PATIENT X594
No.  Now everybody talks about that and.

SECOND PERSON X594
Maybe all the @@@.

PATIENT X594
I think its muscle, honest to God.

SECOND PERSON X594
Or a lot of water.

DOCTOR X594
It's probably just a touch of water, not a lot.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
It's @@@.

PATIENT X594
Everybody talks about that as if I'm gonna die from it.

DOCTOR X594
No, no, that's not the reason.  Uh you may just have thought it was, but I think.

PATIENT X594
But as far as lungs go.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah.

PATIENT X594
I go to the Health Club and work out strenuously and I do snow removal now.

DOCTOR X594
Good.

PATIENT X594
And I'm not getting shortness of breath, honest to God.  That's the good thing about it.

DOCTOR X594
Definitely, you'd come tell us if you were.  I mean that's.

PATIENT X594
If I were I'd tell you and I'd tell DOCTOR.  I'm coughing, I'm bothering her but I'm not getting shortness of breath.

SECOND PERSON X594
The thing is he doesn't usually cough while he's sleeping.

PATIENT X594
Well see when I get more @@@ I cough.

SECOND PERSON X594
@@@.

DOCTOR X594
Yeah but when you fall asleep it goes down.

SECOND PERSON X594
It seems to stop.  Cause I'm up and he's still sleeping, his coughing stops.

DOCTOR X594
@@@ could the problem.  @@@.

PATIENT X594
Okay I'd like to get this renewed.

DOCTOR X594
Ear drops, no problem.

PATIENT X594
I kept getting wax in my ears.

DOCTOR X594
How are you cleaning your ears?

PATIENT X594
Huh?

DOCTOR X594
You're not using Q-Tips are you?

PATIENT X594
Huh?

DOCTOR X594
Are you using any Q-Tips?

PATIENT X594
No, no, that's a bad thing to do.

DOCTOR X594
Right, just making sure.

SECOND PERSON X594
He has a brush that he uses to clean out his hearing aids.

DOCTOR X594
Okay, but when you put the drops in you just let it run out on their own right?

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
So it runs out, good.  Any questions?

PATIENT X594
No.  I was gonna ask if you could renew this but it looks like we've got enough.  Cause this certainly helps.

SECOND PERSON X594
What is it?

DOCTOR X594
Ultram right, tramadol?

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
It's a pretty good pain medication.  It doesn't have too many side effects.  What kind of pains are you using it for?

PATIENT X594
I use it after working out, doing anything strenuous and my knee, so if I get it I can take it and it seems so much better than @@@ out.  I don't overdo it though.  No if it says take two I only take one at a time, just to do it.  

DOCTOR X594
So when you do your snow removal, I guess you're gonna have a lot of work to do tomorrow huh.

PATIENT X594
I use a snow blower.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X594
He's got the snow blower all ready.

PATIENT X594
My son paid $350 for it to save my life.  But once in a while I use a shovel.

SECOND PERSON X594
We're from xxx, we live in.

DOCTOR X594
xxx xxx.

SECOND PERSON X594
@@@.  There must have been a terrible accident today on the way south.

DOCTOR X594
Bad traffic.

SECOND PERSON X594
But they had a sign up even that there was an accident @@@ and it really, really crawling so I really @@@ I think that by the time they had moved away the vehicles.  Has he had blood tests in a while?

DOCTOR X594
Yeah it was just about five months ago.

SECOND PERSON X594
Okay.

DOCTOR X594
Which @@@ for him.  He's not on any medications that will mess up his labs so usually once a year is enough.  If nothing changes clinically or he's having some new symptoms then we recheck them but I think the next time you come in we'll get some repeat labs.  So let me make sure all your medications look okay before you leave.  You're inhalers they're all good, set-up for you for a year okay.

PATIENT X594
Yeah these are good.

DOCTOR X594
Your blood pressure pill is good until November.  You have all the refills you'll need.

PATIENT X594
Yeah.

DOCTOR X594
Uh.  You're still on, you don't need the gabapentin anymore right?

PATIENT X594
Huh?

DOCTOR X594
The gabapentin, the one you took for shingles, you're not taking that anymore are you?

SECOND PERSON X594
No.

DOCTOR X594
Let me get rid of that.  Uh oh it mentions, when was the last time you got a shot in your knee?  Are they still doing that?  Did it help at all?

PATIENT X594
It stopped working.

DOCTOR X594
The tramadol has been working okay though?  The Ultram, the pain medication?

PATIENT X594
That's all that's left.

DOCTOR X594
It's still helping though?

PATIENT X594
Huh?

DOCTOR X594
It's still helping?

PATIENT X594
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.  That's good.

PATIENT X594
Those shots in my knees and I had a lot of them.

DOCTOR X594
It's not cutting it.

PATIENT X594
It's @@@.

DOCTOR X594
I'm gonna refill this one cause this one's out.

PATIENT X594
Okay.

DOCTOR X594
So you're on 50, one tablet how many times a day?

PATIENT X594
I don't do that.  I just take it one at a time.

DOCTOR X594
Okay.  And I'll put that in the mail for you or do you want to pick it up today?

SECOND PERSON X594
In the mail.

PATIENT X594
Just mail them.

SECOND PERSON X594
Could he get the shot today?

DOCTOR X594
Yeah.

PATIENT X594
Oh.

DOCTOR X594
I'm gonna send you to the Pharmacy as soon as I go talk to my boss.  I'll send you to the Pharmacy now to pick up the shot and then hopefully one of the nurses, we'll see if we can find a different one, will give you the shot okay.  Does that sound okay?

PATIENT X594
Yeah they can mail this.

DOCTOR X594
That and then this one you can pick up today if you'd like.

PATIENT X594
Okay.  Tylenol in the mail @@@ and the new inhaler keep.  

DOCTOR X594
Um how long will one of those @@@ last for? 

PATIENT X594
I can't tell.

DOCTOR X594
How often do you use it?  Every day?

PATIENT X594
Every day.

DOCTOR X594
And then how long have you had that bottle for?

PATIENT X594
Well I've got a couple other ones that you know @@@ you know I really can't tell when they're out.  I squirt it on my hand to be sure @@@.  I just want to be safe, yeah.  As long as we're doing this.  

DOCTOR X594
Let me talk to my boss real quick okay.

PATIENT X594
Uh Nasonex is the only other thing that I.

DOCTOR X594
It's in there and already fixed.

PATIENT X594
Okay.

DOCTOR X594
I'll be right back.

PATIENT X594
Thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  28:58  DOCTOR IN:  38:56)

DOCTOR X594
I'll have you guys go to the Pharmacy to get the shot.

SECOND PERSON X594
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X594
Uh @@@ get everything @@@ talk about this.  I thought it was less good use of your time if you're here waiting.  I don't think there's anything new I'm gonna tell you.  Get your medications.  Just swing by the door and I'll you anything else I want to change.

SECOND PERSON X594
Okay and what do we do with the shot?

DOCTOR X594
You'll pick it up at the Pharmacy, so it's at the Pharmacy.

SECOND PERSON X594

DOCTOR X594
Bring it back to the Nurse’s Station here and then one of the nurses can administer it.

PATIENT X594
Thank you.

DOCTOR X594
Have a nice day.

PATIENT X594
Oh you're keeping me alive.

DOCTOR X594

PATIENT X646
And around 6 o'clock in the morning I woke up with the pain so I went to the hospital.  So I was in there for three days.

DOCTOR X646
And then what did they do for you?

PATIENT X646
Uh they gave me morphine for the pain.

DOCTOR X646
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X646
And they put, I think it was, what was it, Cipro.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.

PATIENT X646
And uh gave it by IV.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.

PATIENT X646
And the swelling went down.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.

PATIENT X646
And once the swelling went down and they were okay with it, then let me go but the they put me on Cipro enough to last me for a week.

PATIENT X646

DOCTOR X646
Wasn't that bad.

Yeah.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.

PATIENT X646
And the pain would come like maybe once an hour.

DOCTOR X646
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X646

DOCTOR X646
Okay.

PATIENT X646

Oh okay.

DOCTOR X646
Okay and so you have an appointment with the GI doctors next week.

PATIENT X646
Yeah.

DOCTOR X646
Um, let me just go talk to my attending and I'll be right back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  72:36  DOCTOR IN:  80:17)

DOCTOR X646
Okay, do you remember when your last tetanus shot was?

PATIENT X646
No.

DOCTOR X646
Have you had one in the last ten years do you think?

PATIENT X646
Hmm.

DOCTOR X646
If not we do a booster shot every ten years.

PATIENT X646
Oh.

DOCTOR X646
So uh you can actually get that done today.

PATIENT X646
Well yeah I guess.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X646
Um when I came, I think it was the last time.

DOCTOR X646
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X646
I got the tuberculosis thing but I don't remember having them reading it.

DOCTOR X646
Was it a @@@ test?

PATIENT X646
Yeah.

DOCTOR X646
Okay um so.  Have you ever been exposed to anybody with TB like in your family that you know of?

PATIENT X646
No.

DOCTOR X646
Okay and so given that you are um, so you're from Mexico originally which is considered a high risk area.

PATIENT X646
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X646
And these are areas where they have to be there and also because you in the service that's why they normally do a screen test but if you're not having any symptoms of TB which is things like weight loss or cough, coughing up blood you know, night sweats, things like that.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
Then we really don't.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
Need to do anything that would tell us to do a screening test @@@ if you've been exposed to TB.

PATIENT X646
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X646
Okay so you don't actually have any symptoms of having the disease.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
Uh we may consider doing that later because if you've been exposed to it.

PATIENT X646
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X646
Um and that test is positive it can tell us that you may be at risk for getting the disease of TB later, so like we can work with it, you get exposed to it and then it kind of just hides out and then one day later reactivates and that's when you get the lung disease.  So we would treat you if you just showed, if the test is positive and it just showed that you were exposed to it.

PATIENT X646
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X646
Um we'd treat you with the medication for like nine months and then help with it or prevent it from the @@@ of tuberculosis.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
But let's focus on a couple of other things today.

PATIENT X646
Yeah.

DOCTOR X646
First @@@ and the TB skin test okay.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
Oh the nurse, when you check in and usually every time the nurses, they do this, they have to ask you questions kind of a little checking system that we do so we help us check things and um there were some questions in here regarding like your time in service thing you know uh that you've been having nightmares about your time in service, things like that.  Constantly being watchful, easily startled, things like that and those can be symptoms of PTSD.  Have you ever heard of that before?

PATIENT X646
I've heard of it but never really.

DOCTOR X646
So it stands for post-traumatic stress disorder um and its, you know easily checked out.  @@@ symptoms of your services and just from you're daily living but these questions sometimes can help me know uh if you want me to investigate, you know ask about those, so how do you feel I guess about your thoughts on the questions you know.  Do you feel like your thoughts are significantly affecting your daily life?  Do you feel depressed?

PATIENT X646
No I don't feel depressed.

DOCTOR X646
Do you feel like you need to, would you like to talk to somebody more about?

PATIENT X646
No.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.  Has this been going on since you left the service?

PATIENT X646
Um yeah I guess but it sort of, basically um when I came back.

DOCTOR X646
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X646
I just didn't feel right here.

DOCTOR X646
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X646
And I didn't want to be here, I wanted to go back but it took about a year um.  I would be taking, almost for a year, I was taking uh Nyquil to go to sleep cause I just couldn't go to sleep.  If I woke up, cause I went to sleep like for three hours and something would wake me up, I just could not go back to sleep.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.

PATIENT X646
So I would have to take like Nyquil to actually help me relax but now I can't just sleep a full night.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.

PATIENT X646
And but other than that, I think I'm alright.

DOCTOR X646
So if anything changes you should let us know because we do have a lot of other things you know to help with that.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
It's a very common experience so you know it's something that we need to try to have you treat.  So if anything changes just let me know.  Um in the meantime I do want to get some blood work from you.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
So like I said the cholesterol level should be fasting.

PATIENT X646
Right.

DOCTOR X646
Since you're coming back in a week anyway.

PATIENT X646
Yeah.

DOCTOR X646
We can wait till then to do it.

PATIENT X646
Okay next time.

DOCTOR X646
Next time I mean um you're appointment's at 8 a.m. so you may have to be the first one in line for the lab.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
And then go upstairs or you can do it afterwards.

PATIENT X646
Well where's it at now?

DOCTOR X646
It's right down here on the first floor.

PATIENT X646
Okay.  So I show up over there first?

DOCTOR X646

DOCTOR X646
You tell them your name and your last four, they'll have the order, they'll see it.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
And they can draw your blood.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
Do you um your appointment's at 8 though so maybe you should go to the GI Clinic first so they can see you and then go down to the Lab.

PATIENT X646
Where is the GI Clinic.

DOCTOR X646
GI Clinic.

PATIENT X646
Where is it at?

DOCTOR X646
That's for the GI doctors that you have your appointment in a week for.

PATIENT X646
Oh gotcha.

DOCTOR X646
So they can talk about maybe doing the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X646
So go to the GI Clinic first?

DOCTOR X646
I would suggest doing that first so you don't get late for your appointment.  Um your appointment's at 8, so it's like the first appointment they have.

PATIENT X646
So I need to go to my appointment first then go to the Lab right?

DOCTOR X646

DOCTOR X646
What are you doing right now?

PATIENT X646
I drive a mixer truck.

DOCTOR X646
Okay.  Um I don't know how much time you have but we have this thing called the MOVE Program that is a weight loss program and so it's not, it's different for each person it's not like, there are certain times you have to be there but they can work with your schedule and things like that if you're interested.  There's a meeting every Monday at 10 to talk about it and you can learn different things about that.  I really think like if you're sticking with it your weight is what's contributing to the back problem.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
It's very common actually.

PATIENT X646
Alright.

DOCTOR X646
So the more weight you can lose the better it's going to be in the back.  In the meantime you should definitely, you can use some Tylenol if you have significant pain but otherwise you know just doing exercising as you are, continue to do that cause keeping the muscles around your lower back strong helps prevent them from getting worse as well.

PATIENT X646
Alright.

DOCTOR X646
Um let me go talk to the nurse to see if they can give you that tetanus shot.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
So @@@ time um.  Okay.

PATIENT X646
Yeah.

DOCTOR X646
Uh the @@@.

PATIENT X646
Okay.

DOCTOR X646
She'll call you when they're ready to give you your shot and @@@.

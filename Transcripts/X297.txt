PATIENT X297
What do your colleagues call you, doctor?

DOCTOR X297
@@@.

PATIENT X297
So I'll call you DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X297
Alright.  Okay um so.  @@@ So last time you came to see us in December 2010, so it's been almost more than a year.

PATIENT X297
Right yeah.  So, cause I was doing so well they kicked me around.

DOCTOR X297
Oh okay, okay.  So you were doing great.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
And in the meantime, so the only thing I see here is hypertension for you?

PATIENT X297
Right but I've had it all my life.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
I've had it basically all my life.  I've had hypertension.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
Um, my parents have had hypertension.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
So pretty most of my family have hypertension.

DOCTOR X297
Okay how medications do you take for that?

PATIENT X297
Uh I take two, I take uh, I take the hydrochlorothiazide two a day.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
And then I take a cholesterol pill at night.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  So here's the hydrochlorothiazide.  I don't see any cholesterol pills here.  @@@.  So it looks like the last time @@@.

PATIENT X297
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  So you take how many blood pressure medications do you take?

PATIENT X297
Two, I think I take two.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
Two.

DOCTOR X297
What's that with?

PATIENT X297
Uh the lipids, this one here.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  Lisinopril.

PATIENT X297
And then I get hydrochlorothiazide.

DOCTOR X297
Right.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
Okay, okay.  And it seemed like at one time that you were taking uh three medications.

PATIENT X297
Right, it was stopped right.

DOCTOR X297
@@@.

PATIENT X297
It was getting better, it was a lot better.

DOCTOR X297
Okay, okay, okay.  And for your cholesterol, I'll try to get the computer to get back here.

PATIENT X297
@@@ about that.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
And uh so I'll just go with the other things.  So did you get a flu shot this year?

PATIENT X297
I don't do flu shots.

DOCTOR X297
You don't do flu shots okay.

PATIENT X297
I don't believe in them.

DOCTOR X297
It shows you got one in 2007 though.

PATIENT X297
No, if it says that, it's not telling the truth.  I haven't had it before.

DOCTOR X297
Oh okay.

PATIENT X297
And I've never ever gonna take a flu shot.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  

PATIENT X297
If I did it was only because the doctor I had, he was so emphatic.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
And I liked him so much that I did it that one time.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
With some series I took when I took them, but normally I never, ever, never get the flu shot.

DOCTOR X297
Oh okay, okay.

PATIENT X297
I don't believe in the theory because I was born in the generation that we've been inoculated, vaccines, this and that.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
So one more thing that my body has to fight and it might just put me in a place that I don't want to be.

DOCTOR X297
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X297
But that's why I don't.  There's enough germs floating around and I already have enough antibodies I believe that.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
I don't need anymore.

DOCTOR X297
Well that's good that you think that.  I don't see any cholesterol @@@.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
So that's a good thing.  

SECOND PERSON X297
@@@ cholesterol is a good thing?

PATIENT X297
Actually, I still have some @@@.

DOCTOR X297
Do you know which one?

SECOND PERSON X297
Not off the top of my head I don't.

PATIENT X297
Well it should be on there from prior.

DOCTOR X297
Prior notes?

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  Okay so you're taking simvastatin 80 mg.  Are you still taking this @@@?

PATIENT X297
Yes.

DOCTOR X297
You sure?

PATIENT X297
Yes.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  So your blood tested fine.  Uh so you're taking simvastatin.  It seems that you were taking 80 mg.

PATIENT X297
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X297
@@@.

PATIENT X297
Well you know how I was taking 80 and you told me to break it in half and take 40, that's probably why I still have all that.

DOCTOR X297
Oh you take 40 okay.  Let me correct this, so you were taking 40.  And your kidney function is a little bit lower than the usual person.  I think you've heard that before.

PATIENT X297
Right I've heard that before.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah but it's been stable.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
So that's good.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
So basically your blood tests look good.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
And cholesterol looks good too.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
So you can continue to take your statin.  I'll order that today so that if you run out.  Do you want them to send it to your home?

PATIENT X297
Yes.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
I have one other problem.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
I have a hernia, oh well I had a hernia.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
But I don't know if it has, because I didn't have no surgery or if just kind of healed on its own.

DOCTOR X297
Okay uh so let me examine you and then I can see.

PATIENT X297
Yeah.

DOCTOR X297
Uh so you had this for a long time?

PATIENT X297
No.

DOCTOR X297
Just started?

PATIENT X297
No um it was I did some heavy lifting at a job.

DOCTOR X297
Oh.

PATIENT X297
Over the Christmas holidays.

DOCTOR X297
Over the Christmas holidays was that it?

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
So that job ended probably @@@ in town but I @@@.  So I know what the hernia looks like but I don't you know and I never knew what a hernia was cause I'd never had one so I looked it up.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah so those things, you know, you don't have it done when @@@.  Well did say you developed it?

PATIENT X297
You know um.

DOCTOR X297
You know um @@@.  So it's not something really but I can take a look at that.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah.  But it's nothing urgent.  Do you have any severe belly pain or difficulty sleeping?

PATIENT X297
No.

DOCTOR X297
Nausea?

PATIENT X297
No.

DOCTOR X297
Vomiting?

PATIENT X297
No.  I would a came in.

DOCTOR X297
I would like see @@@.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
And is it bothering you a lot?

PATIENT X297
No.

DOCTOR X297
Not bothering at all?

PATIENT X297
No it's not bothering me at all.

DOCTOR X297
So that's going to be basically an elective surgery.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
So if you want to do it, if you want to fix it, I just refer you to the Surgery surgeon.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
Because if it's not bothering you at all right now.

PATIENT X297
Just leave it alone.

DOCTOR X297
And if you want to wait, you could just leave it alone.

PATIENT X297
No there's no pain or anything.  There's a little discomfort.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah.  Um if you have a pain in a hernia, that's kind of an emergency so you have to come.

PATIENT X297
Right okay.

DOCTOR X297
But you don't have any pain right now.

PATIENT X297
No.

DOCTOR X297
Then uh you can wait, it's up to you.

PATIENT X297
No it wasn't, well actually the only thing there was a little bit of swelling.  There wasn't no active pain that even occurred.

DOCTOR X297
Okay let me take a look okay.  Alright so your blood pressure medicines and you still have the blood pressure medicines or do you need refills?

PATIENT X297
No I think I'm okay @@@ today.  I think a couple of these.  Look at the, I mean I have that and basically I think it's good till March or April of 2007, @@@ I don't know what the number is.

DOCTOR X297
So, it's only @@@ so I'll refill this one.

PATIENT X297
Right you have to refill that one.

DOCTOR X297
And this one's going to be on @@@.  I'll have to go refill both of them.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
And you have some drops for the eyes.

PATIENT X297
Right but I'm in the Eye Clinic.

DOCTOR X297
Oh okay so they can refill them.

PATIENT X297
Right, right.

DOCTOR X297
On your eyes.  Have you had an ultrasound of your kidneys before?  Do you remember?

PATIENT X297
Uh I don't remember.  More than likely yes but that's why I think they said it was just something we have to watch.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
I think I have.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
Because I've been on hydrochlorothiazide for so many years.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
Uh, I don't know, 20 years.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
So.

DOCTOR X297
So hydrochlorothiazide you get 60 pills at a time, I'll change it so you can get 90 pills at a time and then three refills that'll last you for one year.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
I'll send you this.  And what time do you take the blood pressure pills?

PATIENT X297
In the morning.

DOCTOR X297
In the morning.  Morning is fine but I actually.  Do you check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X297
I can.

DOCTOR X297
You can, you have a machine there?

PATIENT X297
Yes.

DOCTOR X297
Okay so I actually recommend um taking it at night.  The reason is because when you take it in the morning.

PATIENT X297
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X297
It seems in the daytime you have good blood pressure, so when you take it you have a good blood pressure.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
Uh but some people have higher blood pressure when they're sleeping.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
And then those are the times that we have more risks of having some kind of event like you know.

PATIENT X297
Yeah but if you take it at night you're going to have to get up in the night and go to the bathroom right?

DOCTOR X297
With @@@?  To you pee more with the @@@?

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
Okay then we can do this.

PATIENT X297
Right so if I know exactly what you're saying but if you take it at night then you take it, you know you'll have to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to go to the bathroom.

DOCTOR X297
Okay so @@@ there is more peeing?

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
So we can keep that in the morning and how about taking the other one, lisinopril at night?

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
Does that make sense?

PATIENT X297
Yeah.

DOCTOR X297
But you know, if you take both in the morning, in the daytime you have a good blood pressure and you say okay I'm fine.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
But at night time you may have a high blood pressure and we don't know.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
So if you sleep at night then in the daytime you'll see you know your higher blood pressures.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
And if that's controlled I would say don't lower it.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
Do you see what I am saying?

PATIENT X297
I know exactly what you're saying.  No I understand completely.  I've been coming here to the doctors for, no, no I understand.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah.

PATIENT X297
Exactly what you're saying.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah.

PATIENT X297
That makes all the sense in the world.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  So let's do that.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
And then there's one shot called Dtap.  I don't know if you've had that before um tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.  I don't think you had that before.  It prevents from three diseases, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.

PATIENT X297
Have I ever had it before?

DOCTOR X297
You had one called tetanus D.

PATIENT X297
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X297
To prevent tetanus and diphtheria.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
That didn't cover pertussis.

PATIENT X297
What is pertussis?

DOCTOR X297
That's what's called uh.

PATIENT X297
Whooping cough?

DOCTOR X297
Whooping cough yes and so right now we have this new vaccine so the recommendation from the top is that.

PATIENT X297
You ask the patient do they want it?

DOCTOR X297
Yeah we have to ask.

PATIENT X297
@@@.

DOCTOR X297
And if the patient is younger than 65.

PATIENT X297
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X297
We recommended everybody to get those um vaccines.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
So if you don't mind we can do that today.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
Okay let's do that.

PATIENT X297
I'm doing it because you're new and I like you.

DOCTOR X297
Then you had a polyp when they did the colonoscopy in 2007.

PATIENT X297
Right I had a polyp right.

DOCTOR X297
So the recommendation for you is to repeat the colonoscopy in five to seven years.

PATIENT X297
That's right.

DOCTOR X297
So five years is going to be 2012.

PATIENT X297
That's this year?

DOCTOR X297
It's this year.

PATIENT X297
Has it been that long?

DOCTOR X297
And seven years is going to be uh 2014.

PATIENT X297
Right.  So I need to be scheduled for a colonoscopy this year.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah I think if you want to schedule, we can schedule this year.

PATIENT X297
Yep.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  

PATIENT X297
No problem.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
Sounds good.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  And uh labs, we'll get all the labs we need.  So I was thinking that you might do that so I ordered the lab tests that we need, yeah @@@ great.  So I'll just schedule it.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
I'll just schedule it and you get the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X297
Okay.  Yeah they'll call me and say @@@ they don't tell you the reserve day.  @@@.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  You had the ultrasound I can't see it here.

PATIENT X297
And that had to be quite a while ago um when I was in Arizona and it might have been oh six or seven years ago now.  It might need to be repeated if you want another one.

DOCTOR X297
Oh okay.  Do you remember having one?

PATIENT X297
Do what?

DOCTOR X297
A renal ultrasound and they said it was normal?

PATIENT X297
Right.  Okay now it had to be during the summer in maybe 2000.

DOCTOR X297
Okay, okay.  So let's see @@@ okay.  Do you smoke sir?

PATIENT X297
No never have.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
Not one cigarette in my whole life.

DOCTOR X297
Do you drink?

PATIENT X297
No.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.  Um how's your weight doing?

PATIENT X297
Uh I might have gained about 10-15 pounds.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
In the last year.

DOCTOR X297
Okay are you watching your diet?

PATIENT X297
No.

DOCTOR X297
Okay, take a deep breath.

PATIENT X297
Uh no, am I watching my diet, uh try to eat normal.  I don't eat, I don't eat, real good food and vegetables and stuff like that but.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
Yeah so this is a, yeah you're right, this is a hernia.

PATIENT X297
Right.

DOCTOR X297
Um, @@@.  So it's up to you.  If it's bothering you and you think you want a surgery, you can be referred to Surgery.  I can refer you to Surgery if you want to talk to them um but if you think it's not bothering you right now, unless.

PATIENT X297
It's bothering me in pain right.

DOCTOR X297
Right, right, right.

PATIENT X297
No there's no pain.

DOCTOR X297
Or does it feel like something's hanging and it's feeling ordinary or no?

PATIENT X297
I just know it's a true hernia.  But see the thing is, sometimes when I urinate it makes a sound.

DOCTOR X297
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X297
Cause you know the opening there so it makes a sound.

DOCTOR X297
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X297
That's the only thing that I've noticed.  Other than that there's really no pain or anything.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297
So is the surgery outpatient?  @@@.

DOCTOR X297
Um I'm not sure.  I come from other countries.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
So where I did my training we used to um have people stay for three or four days um but I don't know how they do, I can ask.

PATIENT X297
Yeah right, ask them, ask somebody.  Do they do it.

DOCTOR X297
If it is an outpatient do you want to do it?

PATIENT X297
Yeah.

DOCTOR X297
If it's an outpatient.  

PATIENT X297
And so mostly what I would do is go on the internet and they will show the surgery because they actually show the whole physical surgery on the internet and this was back in 2000 and they were saying it wasn't outpatient then so I was thinking this is 2012, it ought to be outpatient now.
 
DOCTOR X297
After all this time, with shorter stays in the hospital.

PATIENT X297
Yeah right, right, so you can ask yeah.

DOCTOR X297
If it's an outpatient you want the surgery.

PATIENT X297
The surgery right.

DOCTOR X297
Alright.  @@@.  Take a deep breath, breathe out, deep breath, breathe out good.  Okay so uh do you work sir?  What do you do for work?

PATIENT X297
Yes.

DOCTOR X297
So you have a Power of Attorney right?

PATIENT X297

DOCTOR X297

DOCTOR X297
Oh okay.

PATIENT X297
But it's in place.  I think it was my sister because I haven't been married that long.

DOCTOR X297
Okay.

PATIENT X297

DOCTOR X297
Okay sir.  So I asked about the hernia and you see like in the private sector they do it as a one day outpatient procedure, but here at the VA we usually keep you overnight.

PATIENT X297
Okay.

DOCTOR X297
So it's going to be @@@ procedure but if you want to do that I can refer you to Surgery.

PATIENT X297
No overnight is @@@.  

DOCTOR X297
So I'll just refer you to the Surgery.

PATIENT X297

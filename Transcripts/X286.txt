DOCTOR X286

PATIENT X286
But the last time I been here for me was in September when I was going to the Sports Clinic.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay.

PATIENT X286
And so all they did was okayed by Occupational.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X286
As a matter of fact I got another one.

PATIENT X286
Uh yes this is the wheelchair gang.

DOCTOR X286
Oh that's why.  Oh yeah this looks long.

PATIENT X286
Yeah it's not that much @@@.  Uh actually I'm a patient in the Spinal Cord Clinic too see.

DOCTOR X286
I saw that yes.

PATIENT X286
Yeah so most of.

DOCTOR X286
I see all of the.

PATIENT X286
A lot of other things I get them to fill out.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So whatever part that pertains to my physicality I guess you can put that on.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Most of the parts are in the computer.

DOCTOR X286
This part you can fill out.  So this is mainly the physical exam huh?

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  

PATIENT X286
I guess you need this.

DOCTOR X286
Your med list?  Okay so I'll fill this out at the end after I take a look at you okay.

PATIENT X286
Huh?

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  So how are you doing, what brings you in today?

PATIENT X286
Well just like I say.

DOCTOR X286
So you need a follow-up okay.

PATIENT X286
Well the first, like I say I haven't seen my primary care doctor since, had to be August or June of last year.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X286
And uh.

DOCTOR X286
So you're due huh?

PATIENT X286
Yeah I'm overdue.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, alright.  Well is there anything that you want to talk about today specifically, is something bothering you or that's new?

PATIENT X286
Well I got kind of a night cough.  I keep coughing up phlegm.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So I probably need some type of cough syrup or something.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  And how long have you been coughing for?

PATIENT X286
Uh it's been since the winter months.  I guess since about December.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Maybe about November.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And it only usually happens at night for some reason.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And uh other than that uh, I got a letter that's saying they changed the sildenafil to.

DOCTOR X286
Viagra?

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
And uh the dosage is not high enough for me.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
I need that to probably be 100.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Have you tried it?

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
The dose is what you needed and it's not working?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Okay.  Alright what else?

PATIENT X286
And other than that.

DOCTOR X286
@@@.

PATIENT X286
Uh that's about it.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Uh a lot of the medications that they giving me like for my uh bowel movements.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
I don't even basically use those anymore.  I don't know if it's a problem but when I start having a problem I got to use what they call enemas.

DOCTOR X286
Enemas?

PATIENT X286
Enemas, its a little tube.

DOCTOR X286
Yes.

PATIENT X286
Okay I don't see it on there.

DOCTOR X286
Oh.

PATIENT X286
Oh I think it might be on there, its okay.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah it's this one.

PATIENT X286
How many more prescriptions I got for that?

DOCTOR X286
You have two refills.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
I'll give you more.

PATIENT X286
Well I mean I'm okay with that.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Cause I see my Baclofen I got one refill left for that.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And I think you're gonna have to order that.

DOCTOR X286
You want to have that.

PATIENT X286
I probably need some more of that.

DOCTOR X286
Are you taking this Docusate, the oral medication for your stool or no?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
Do you want us to take off your list?

PATIENT X286
No, see the reason for that being it's like, it's unpredictable.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
You see what I'm saying it's like.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
I stay on the second floor.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And I stay with my son and my daughter-in-law.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So I got 16 stairs to my bedroom.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so it's unpredictable so it'd be like maybe three or four days I don't have the desire to go.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So I know I have to so that's when I use the enema.  I have one of them in the bathroom I got access to.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, so you just use the enemas?

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Now like I say I don't know if that's a problem.

DOCTOR X286
So I don't know if they're good to use regularly.

PATIENT X286
You see I end up using them anytime I have to go, other than I don't have no.

DOCTOR X286
I think maybe what we should do is, so are you able to walk at all?

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
You are.

PATIENT X286
Yeah at home I walk with a cane.

DOCTOR X286
Oh.

PATIENT X286
As long as I hold to something.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay okay.  Um so what I would suggest is that we switch you to another medication.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
And so if you don't like the Docusate, if it doesn’t, if it's not predictable or you just don't like it, there's about 100 other things we can try.

PATIENT X286
See the reason why I say this because if I take uh, the Docusate is basically a stool softener.

DOCTOR X286
Softener yes.

PATIENT X286
Okay so if I take it and I don't know when it's gonna work.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And I might be.

DOCTOR X286
You just have to have a bowel movement very suddenly after you take it?

PATIENT X286
Uh not the pills but the uh like they gave me, I think it's a laxative too.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah that one is unpredictable yeah.

PATIENT X286
That one was like for constipation.

DOCTOR X286
But the Docusate shouldn't be.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
I mean I don't have a problem as far as my stool being soft or nothing.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
I don't have a problem with that.

DOCTOR X286
So why don't you, so what is the problem?  You weren't taking it otherwise.

PATIENT X286
In otherwise the problem is that I don't have a desire to go at all.

DOCTOR X286
You don't feel like you have to go?

PATIENT X286
I don't have to go at all but I know I've been waiting three or four days without going.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.  Know what I think you should do is start taking Miralax, so I'll prescribe that for you.  So Miralax is uh, it's a powder and you need to take one or two capfuls a day and you just mix it in anything and you can't taste it at all.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
I've used it before; you really can't taste it okay.  Um.

PATIENT X286
I mean it doesn't come all of a sudden.

DOCTOR X286
No not at all.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
So I think that this will be, you're right the Docusate is just a softener.  It doesn't make you have to go.

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
So if that's the problem then Docusate is not the right medicine for you.  Um and the other one that you probably took is uh, is probably Bisacodyl or something like that where a laxative, those make you have to go very suddenly um.

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
So Miralax is a really good option.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Because you just take it every day and it should make you have to go every couple days.

PATIENT X286
Okay that's something I need.

DOCTOR X286
So let's just try that.

PATIENT X286
Now see I don't think it's healthy for me to just.

DOCTOR X286
I don't think.

PATIENT X286
Waiting three or four days.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah I don't think it's healthy for you to use enemas that frequently.

PATIENT X286
Without going and then I have to keep using the enemas you know.

DOCTOR X286
So try the Miralax, take two capfuls a day.  You can put it in, I don't know what you drink but you can put it in your coffee or your water or whatever.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Um and take it every day.  Give it like a week or so to really start doing the job.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay then hopefully you can do that instead of the enemas. 

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
You can still use enemas when you need them.

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
But using them three or four times a week is too much.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Cause see basically the only, like I said I use them.  I don't have a desire to go, I could be three or four days and I'm constantly eating.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
So then I start feeling bloated.

DOCTOR X286
Sure okay.

PATIENT X286
And so I know it's a time that I'm at home and I don't have to go out cause I go out enough, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays when I'm taking therapy.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so I don't want to have to just watch it when I'm out @@@.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah, sure I understand.  

PATIENT X286
You know.

DOCTOR X286
Okay so let's try that and see if it works okay.

PATIENT X286
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X286
Alright.  Um and are you still taking the Norco?

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
The hydrocodone okay.  Uh where do you have pain?

PATIENT X286
Well I got scoliosis.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So I always have pain in my back.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
But sometime I get like a sharp pain since I had the surgery.  I'll have a sharp pain in the back of my head on the left hand side and it's like a, like getting hit in the head with a hammer.

DOCTOR X286
Hmm, okay.

PATIENT X286
And it just comes all of a sudden.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so if it don't go away you know I'll take it.

DOCTOR X286
You take it okay.

PATIENT X286
So basically when I do a lot of physical activity my back will start hurting.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So before I take a shower in the morning I'll take one.

DOCTOR X286
You take that okay.

PATIENT X286
And then if I do some therapy or something I'll take another one.

DOCTOR X286
Okay gotcha.  Have you ever tried anything like tramadol or anything else for pain?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
No okay.  

PATIENT X286
They put me on oxycodone one time but it was kind of, it didn't nothing but put me to sleep.

DOCTOR X286
Okay gotcha.  And this one's not bad, uh we can continue this.  There are other medications that are a little bit easier on your system if they work and I'm not.

PATIENT X286
And I think the Norco constipates me.

DOCTOR X286
It does yeah.  So that's why I'm saying um but what I can do is give you a prescription for a medication and your kidneys work okay?

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah okay.  So there's another medicine that you can try in place of the Norco, called tramadol um and it's not, won't constipate you.  It's not as strong so it might not work but if it does it's a much better option.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay so at least try it.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Um.

PATIENT X286
I'll try it.

DOCTOR X286
Um you haven't tried it in the past.

PATIENT X286
I've never tried it.

DOCTOR X286
And then it doesn't work then.

PATIENT X286
I mean just like right now, it depends on the position I'm in.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
Whether I'm gonna have pain or not.  Pain is a given for me, I mean I accept that.

DOCTOR X286
Yes.

PATIENT X286
But sometimes it's just more prevalent depending on the activities that I'm doing.

DOCTOR X286
Sure.

PATIENT X286
You know.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  So what I recommend is the tramadol cause it's not as strong um.  You can take it every day no problem.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
You can even take two a day um, it's not as addicting and it's not constipating.  It's not um not like a controlled substance.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
The way Norco is.  Um so I would take one every morning and then you can take a second one in the afternoon.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Try that for a couple days and if it's not doing anything.

PATIENT X286
Without the Norco.

DOCTOR X286
Without the Norco.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Um you can take them together; they're not bad together um.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Um so if you have a day that you try the tramadol and all of a sudden you're in a lot of pain, you can still take the Norco.

PATIENT X286
Okay, I understand right.

DOCTOR X286
Um but if you, if the tramadol works then.

PATIENT X286
I could discontinue okay.

DOCTOR X286
Go off the Norco or take it less frequently.

PATIENT X286
Like I do believe the Norco is what's constipating me.

DOCTOR X286
It will, absolutely yes.

PATIENT X286
So that causes me to have a problem with my digestive system.

DOCTOR X286
Yes, you're exactly right about that okay.  So let's try that and see how you do.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Um okay so what other medical problems do you have?  Like you a follow a doctor for, you have scoliosis?

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
You had surgery on your scoliosis?

PATIENT X286
No, never did.

DOCTOR X286
What kind of back surgery have you had?

PATIENT X286
I've had surgery; I had a bone in my neck pressing up against my spinal cord.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay.

PATIENT X286
And so I had a laminectomy.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so like I said, @@@ out.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so sometimes during the day, like say, it depends on my activities.  My neck will get tired and I'll have pain in that too you know.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
I just, then I go take @@@.

DOCTOR X286
And um do you have weakness in your lower extremities?

PATIENT X286
I got this weakness in my left leg, no in my right leg and my left arm and my left hand is numb.

DOCTOR X286
Your right leg and your left arm?

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
And what about, tell me about your numbness?

PATIENT X286
Okay so, this is how it started.  I had an operation on my hammertoes in the service.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And I ended up with calluses up under the bottom of my right foot.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so every time I take a step I steps down on the calluses it would hurt.

DOCTOR X286
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X286
So it caused me to start walking on my tip toe.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So with me walking on my top toes, so I didn't bend my right leg see.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so now, the tendons in the back of my leg won't stretch all the way out.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And that in time, it probably had something with me doing twisting my back.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Okay so when I started mentioning they gave me a cane.

DOCTOR X286
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X286
Doctor told me to use the cane in my left hand but my left being numb I have no control over it.

DOCTOR X286
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X286
So I started walking with it in my right hand.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
But still this twisted my spine.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, gotcha, okay.

PATIENT X286
And that's basically where I'm at today.

DOCTOR X286
Okay do you have lower back pain?

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X286
It's always like on the right hand side.

DOCTOR X286
On that side.  Okay what happened with your arm, why is it numb?

PATIENT X286
Well my left hand is numb from the.

DOCTOR X286
Oh from that surgery?

PATIENT X286
Yeah, well no it had been numb for the longest.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay.

PATIENT X286
And what actually happened was they took a MRI and uh they saw that a bone was pressing up against my spinal cord.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
And I told them I didn't want to have an operation just for my left hand being numb so I dealt with it.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
I mean I would pick up things and I'd drop them.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
And whatever so as time went on, every time I walked my right foot would start turning inward.

DOCTOR X286
Hmm.

PATIENT X286
And this was causing me to trip and fall.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And stuff.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So they gave me a walker.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Then I started walking with the walker and then I had another MRI and the bone pressed up to my spinal cord and started looking like a pancake.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay so then you had to get the surgery.

PATIENT X286
So then I had to have the surgery so.  When I had the surgery, the residual from it, my right foot still turns inward.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And I'm taking uh Botox shots in the back of my legs so I can stretch it out.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
But what it is, it's the same when I walk.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah, sure okay.

PATIENT X286
So I had to try to learn how to walk again basically.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay.

PATIENT X286
So I'm still kind of clumsy you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, gotcha.

PATIENT X286
Cause I got 16 stairs at home so.

DOCTOR X286
You have to get up those.

PATIENT X286
I get up and down the stairs with a cane.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, okay.  So besides all this stuff with your joints and your back and everything, do you have any other problems like high blood pressure?

PATIENT X286
No.  Now my blood pressure is high today.

DOCTOR X286
It was high today, yeah.  You take it at home?

PATIENT X286
Never.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Cause I had another.

DOCTOR X286
Has it ever been high before?

PATIENT X286
No.  Normally it's in the 130s.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And like I told them, when I took physical therapy it was 128 and then I wheeled myself over here.

DOCTOR X286
Okay yeah that could be why.

PATIENT X286
So that's probably the reason why.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, we'll watch it.

PATIENT X286
I have never took high blood pressure medication or nothing.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah why don't we watch it?  I don't like to start anything just on one reading.

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
Since you just got here so if, we'll just make sure it's not continuing and keep an eye on it okay.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Do you have any diabetes?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
No okay.  Any cancers?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
Any problems with your heart?

PATIENT X286
No.  Now they did say I had a irregular heartbeat, the last EKG I took.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
That was in September I think.

DOCTOR X286
Let's take a look.  Did they start you on any medication for it?

PATIENT X286
No.  I don't even think they recommended any.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Okay, it looks okay.

PATIENT X286
Okay good.  That's good to know.

DOCTOR X286
Yes that's true.  Yeah it's good.

PATIENT X286
That's too good of thing, considering at the time cause I was involved in so many physical activities.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, okay, yeah that's fine.

PATIENT X286
It's a possibility.

DOCTOR X286
Sure okay.  Um okay and any medical problems that run in your family?

PATIENT X286
Uh my mother was diabetic and my father he had uh heart problems.

DOCTOR X286
At a young age or was he older?

PATIENT X286
Yeah well he lived to 90.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay.

PATIENT X286
She lived to 79 so.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Okay.  Alright and are you a smoker?

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
Presently?

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
Why are you still smoking?

PATIENT X286
I keep trying to stop but it makes me gain weight so I have got down to no more than five cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR X286
Okay how long have you been smoking for?

PATIENT X286
Since I was about 12 years old.

DOCTOR X286
Now you're almost 50 so okay.

PATIENT X286
I mean I have stopped before but I guess I don't smoke as much in the wintertime cause I have to go outside to smoke.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
So I might smoke maybe three cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Just actually 2 1/2 really.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
It's not, I don't know, it's just I guess that's what it is, just a habit.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Are you interested in quitting?

PATIENT X286
Uh yes.

DOCTOR X286
Have you ever, what have you done in the past.

PATIENT X286
I've taken uh, what's the little lozenges.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.  Was it gum or the actual lozenges?

PATIENT X286
The lozenges.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And I take them and they're so strong that when I take them they would have me gagging.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Coughing and stuff.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
I mean when I'm supposed to take them, I mean.

DOCTOR X286
Have you tried the gum?

PATIENT X286
Never.

DOCTOR X286
Do you chew gum ever?

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
They don't stop me though.

DOCTOR X286
So maybe you should try the gum.  Have you used the patches?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
Do you want to try the patches too?

PATIENT X286
I prefer the gum.

DOCTOR X286
Just the gum alone.

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Let's, we can try the gum and if it doesn't work.

PATIENT X286
See the reason why I say that is because I don't want to have the patch on, if I didn't have the urge to smoke that doubles it.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.  Well so what you could do is if you ever do use the patches.

PATIENT X286
Don't.

DOCTOR X286
And you need to smoke; obviously we don't want you to.

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
Um so what the most success.  The way people are most successful is that they do the patches and either the gum or the lozenges so that they have some nicotine in their systems.

PATIENT X286
And then they.

DOCTOR X286
And the way the patches work is you change them every day and the amount of nicotine goes down so every two weeks it helps your body to kind of detox from the nicotine.

PATIENT X286
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X286
And then if you have an urge to smoke you're supposed to take the gum instead of the cigarettes.

PATIENT X286
Okay, the same stuff.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
I'll try that.

DOCTOR X286
And then if the worst case scenario and you have a really bad day or something and you need to smoke you can take the patch off and then you can smoke.

PATIENT X286
Actually I used to buy a carton of cigarettes per month.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
You know and those last me a whole month.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
Cause I had just got, it was a habit of buying a whole carton.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And so now I don't.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
You know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X286
Well that's good.  I'm glad you've cut back.

PATIENT X286
Yeah so I'm making it last.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, but if you're, you know you're close so.  If you're only smoking three a day maybe we can get down.

PATIENT X286
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah and that's the best thing you can do in the world for your health.

PATIENT X286
I know.

DOCTOR X286
Okay so um.  Do you want to try that?

PATIENT X286
Yeah I will.

DOCTOR X286
Do you want to try the patches?

PATIENT X286
Yeah I will, I will.

DOCTOR X286
Okay great, that's good.

PATIENT X286
Yeah I'll try it.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Cause I keep saying you know I cut down on my own and then I be paying for the cigarettes.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
You know what I mean.  I take the lozenges and they gag me.

DOCTOR X286
And they're bad yeah.

PATIENT X286
It's not you know and then I put it out and I'm still paying for the cigarettes.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
Cause I don't want to take another lozenge cause I know the results of that.

DOCTOR X286
Sure, sure.

PATIENT X286
But then I go down there and I start eating.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, okay and honestly it's okay.  I'd rather you eat than smoke.

PATIENT X286
And then if I eat, I keep eating and then I get bloated and then I'll have to take an enema.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay, so yeah I see, okay.  Alright well let's try the patches and the gum.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
And see how you do okay.

PATIENT X286
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X286

Well I'd say about a day I might have three beers at the most.

DOCTOR X286
A day okay.

PATIENT X286
You know.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, alright.  That's just on the cusp of too much but that's okay.

PATIENT X286

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Um do you use any illicit drugs like?

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
We don't need to do lab work as long as everything is normal once a year.

DOCTOR X286
Okay so the next time I see you before you come in, just don't eat breakfast that morning you need your lab work done fasting.

PATIENT X286
Okay right.

DOCTOR X286
And then we'll go over it.

PATIENT X286
So that was after @@@ when I got the appointment then I had to go do labs and they told me since you're going to have a new doctor go find out first.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X286
So they checked the computers.

DOCTOR X286
Sure.

PATIENT X286

PATIENT X286

DOCTOR X286
So it sounds like you're okay.

PATIENT X286
Oh I'm all good with that.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

Something like stars or something.

DOCTOR X286
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X286
I don't know just lately, no more than two weeks.

DOCTOR X286
Do you get dizzy at all?  Have you fallen?

PATIENT X286
Uh I did fall but.

DOCTOR X286
What @@@.

PATIENT X286
No I fell cause I was @@@.

DOCTOR X286
Alright, okay.

PATIENT X286
And they had me in a bucket with the one speed.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
And I was trying to get to my balance, the reason I fell is I just the other way to the left.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Then I just go over that.  I used the crutches with the tube and @@@.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X286
@@@.

DOCTOR X286
We'll keep an eye on it.  If it's still going on we can look into it more closely but I'm not sure exactly what would cause that.  Any pain when I push down on your throat?  Any weight loss or weight gain, are you feeling anything when I press there?

PATIENT X286
I think I just gained some weight.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Probably from trying to stop smoking.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Breathe normal.  Take a deep breath.  Take a deep breath here, just so I can listen.

PATIENT X286
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X286
Take a few more breaths.  Okay.  So you're coughing phlegm up at night?

PATIENT X286
Yeah, it's something like a kind of had a little longer.

DOCTOR X286
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X286
You know I don't know if it's a cold or.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Well like are you actually coughing it up do you see it?

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
What color is it?

PATIENT X286
Grayish.

DOCTOR X286
Any blood in it?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
No, oh and you're not coughing at all during the day?

PATIENT X286
No @@@ sometimes I can feel a cold in my throat and I'm just coughing.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Are you short of breath ever?  No okay.  Um so it might be related to your smoking.

PATIENT X286
I thought of that.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Like a smoker's cough.

DOCTOR X286
Um and this has been going on for how long?  A month?

PATIENT X286
Uh I guess.

DOCTOR X286
No pain when I push?

PATIENT X286
I had appendectomy.

DOCTOR X286
Oh okay.  Do you get swelling in the ankles at all?

PATIENT X286
No.

DOCTOR X286
No okay.  Alright kick out against my hand, same here good.  Kick up against my hand right here, on this side okay and down.  Okay up, okay and down.  Lift up your @@@ touch my hand okay.

PATIENT X286

DOCTOR X286
Okay, this one.

PATIENT X286

DOCTOR X286
@@@.  Okay @@@ into me.  Good, this one now follow in okay.  @@@ try to @@@.  Okay now shrug your shoulder, this one, shrug up, now this one okay.  Now put your hands out like this, turn your hands, okay.  Squeeze my fingers on both sides just as hard as you can good, I feel your thumb okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X286
You can tell the weakness on one.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah I can, yes and this arm is actually pretty strong.  Squeeze my hand again, it's pretty strong.  Do it as hard as you can okay.  Do you do a lot of stuff with this arm?

PATIENT X286
Well uh actually like when I do the physical therapy I've been building this arm up but on some of the weights I have to, in order for it to be even I have to put more weight on this one.

DOCTOR X286
And that one is stressed.

PATIENT X286
Than this one.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X286
You know and like I do the weights one at a time.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Let me see you stand up.  Okay.

PATIENT X286
I can't put this leg all the way straight.

DOCTOR X286
So you can't take a step with that foot or you'll fall.

PATIENT X286
I mean I can take s step but my balance is off.

DOCTOR X286
Very difficult yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  This exam form is asking for some details on your strength.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Good okay.  You can get back in your chair.

PATIENT X286
But like I say at home I use a cane.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
And I hold on to different things.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
I don't know if I can put this back on.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, I'm sorry the coughing has been going on for how long?

PATIENT X286
Uh @@@ smoke @@@.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Is it worse when you're laying down or does it happen at night no matter what position that you're in?  Do you think its worse when you're laying down?

PATIENT X286
Yeah.  I guess it's, it's @@@ up at night.

DOCTOR X286
Uh-huh.  Okay.  There's a couple of things we need to check.  Your testosterone.  Okay let me go talk to one of the other doctors about this and um and I'll fill this form out and I'll be right back.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  52:56  DOCTOR IN:  64:49)

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Okay.  That's good.  Almost done with this form.  I'll put all your meds in.  Now for your cough, we can try this Mucinex; this is something to help you break up the mucous.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
A cough suppressant generally isn't a great idea.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Because if you have a lot of mucous in your chest, especially as a smoker, if you don't cough it up you can be more prone to getting a pneumonia or an infection.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Essentially it's good to cough it up.

PATIENT X286
Right.

DOCTOR X286
Um so.

PATIENT X286
I mean the more I'm coughing, if I keep on coughing I can get it to come up.

DOCTOR X286
It comes up okay.

PATIENT X286
I mean it's not a whole lot.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah, yeah.  Have you ever had pulmonary function testing done?  Where you breathe into a machine?

PATIENT X286
Yeah I think I did.

DOCTOR X286
You did.

PATIENT X286
Uh as a matter of fact uh one time, when I was at xxx Brown they tested me and said I had sarcoidosis, sarcoid or something.

DOCTOR X286
Really?

PATIENT X286
It was years ago.

DOCTOR X286
Hmm.

PATIENT X286
And uh they gave me a, this thing that I breathe in and it's got a little ball.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah.

PATIENT X286
Like it was a plastic thing.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  I'll probably repeat your pulmonary function testing.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Cause I think you have COPD.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Because of lung problems that people that smoke for a long time get um and there's a lot of good medications to treat COPD but we don't know, we don't have a diagnosis for this.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
In order to get one we need to have the pulmonary function testing done.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
So why don't make you, we can repeat your chest x-ray if it doesn't go away.  Um let give it another couple weeks.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
And if your cough is no better then we could get it tested okay.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Um and in the meantime we'll get your pulmonary function tests.

PATIENT X286
Right in the meantime I need to cut down on the smoking.

DOCTOR X286
And you cut back smoking yeah okay.

PATIENT X286
Cause I know that's probably fine if I stop it.

DOCTOR X286
I think so.  So give me one second here and I'll just get all this done and then we'll get you on your way.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
So I want you to call me if your cough isn't gone in like three weeks.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Cause I can have the nurse call you but sometimes it doesn't actually happen.

PATIENT X286
Right, right.

DOCTOR X286
So.

PATIENT X286
So then.

DOCTOR X286
You call me.

PATIENT X286
And your extension is?

DOCTOR X286
Uh, let's see the number is PHONE NUMBER.  Okay and DOCTOR so you can leave a message with someone.  You probably won't get me directly but you can actually leave a message.  Okay.  And you've never had any surgery on the back, just the neck you said right?

PATIENT X286
Right.  Like I said I don't know because of my age or cause I've had it so long would it even be possible, I don't know.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah okay.  Have you seen Neurosurgery yet?  No.

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
Oh you did.

PATIENT X286
Uh-huh.  I haven't seen them in a while.

DOCTOR X286
Okay right here yeah.

PATIENT X286
And I know the last time I came here for a operation I ended up coming out of it with broken ribs.

DOCTOR X286
Hmm okay.

PATIENT X286
I know @@@.

DOCTOR X286
Where'd you have your surgery here?

PATIENT X286
Yes.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
It was done September 06, 2010.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
Is that in there?

DOCTOR X286
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah it's in here.

PATIENT X286
Did I get the dates right?

DOCTOR X286
I don't see the surgery date but I have a clinic note you had in January after you got through the surgery.

PATIENT X286
Yeah.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  Okay.  We'll put that up there.  I guess that's it.  Here are your forms.  The rest of it I think you can fill out.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  You have my number.

PATIENT X286
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X286
I'm going to refill all your meds so you can go down today and get them.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.  And then don't forget to call me if your cough doesn't get better in a couple of weeks.

PATIENT X286
In a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR X286
Okay.

PATIENT X286
So just the next time I need to visit you will be in?

DOCTOR X286
I'll see you back like four months. 

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
What about that, we'll just check in.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
And see how your cough is and the cigarettes are doing.  Hopefully you'll have your pulmonary function tests by then as well.

PATIENT X286
Right.  Alright so you going to set up an appointment for that.

DOCTOR X286
I'm going to put in for that okay.

PATIENT X286
Okay.  Thanks very much.

DOCTOR X286
Okay and the next time I see you hopefully you won't be smoking anymore.

PATIENT X286
I hope not.

DOCTOR X286
And your cough will be gone and you'll have those tests done okay.

PATIENT X286
Right okay.

DOCTOR X286
Okay, alright.  I'll help you check out.

PATIENT X286
Let me turn around and go that way.

DOCTOR X286
So again with that pain medicine the new one is called tramadol.

PATIENT X286
Tramadol.

DOCTOR X286
Okay so try it but you know you can keep taking what you're taking if you need it.

PATIENT X286
Okay.

DOCTOR X286
But I think it's worth a try.

PATIENT X286
Then I can stop the constipation, supposed to.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah exactly okay.

PATIENT X286
I knew if I kept taking that hydrocodone it's got some side effects to it too cause it's got the morphine in it.

DOCTOR X286
Right yeah that's correct.  But yeah I think it's worth a try but um, you know sometimes if you've been taking the other one for a while it can be difficult to get off of it so.

PATIENT X286
Oh.

DOCTOR X286
I don't want you to feel sick or anything for pain.

PATIENT X286
What are some of the side effects of withdrawal?

DOCTOR X286
If you still feel shaky or kind of sick to your stomach.

PATIENT X286
Oh okay, cause I know some days if I don't, I try to go without taking it.

DOCTOR X286
You'll feel nausea.

PATIENT X286
You know I try to deal with the pain if I'm just in the house or laying down or something and I'm not doing much and then I kind of feel sick.  I didn't know what that was.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah but the tramadol in place of it might help it.

PATIENT X286
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X286
So you're not twice as bad okay.  Do you know where to check out?  You can check out right here okay.  Okay take care.

PATIENT X286
Alright nice meeting you.

DOCTOR X286
Yeah you too.

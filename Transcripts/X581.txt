PATIENT X581
Oh they do a lot of things.

DOCTOR X581
I'll have to find out.  Yeah we @@@.

PATIENT X581
Yeah I've gone way too long.

DOCTOR X581
About a month ago.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
Um.

PATIENT X581
But you changed up some medications on me sometime.

DOCTOR X581
Your blood pressure wasn't where we wanted it to be so we added this medication called @@@.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
Um how have your blood pressures been since then?

PATIENT X581
Well doc you know it's improving.  It's improving.  She just checked it a little while ago so.  I think she said it was 127 or something like that.

DOCTOR X581
That is more than improving.

PATIENT X581
Huh?

DOCTOR X581
That's more than improving.

PATIENT X581
Yeah, yeah it's coming right along.  Uh I got a little something else to it.

DOCTOR X581
What's that?

PATIENT X581
Uh I been drinking garlic water.

DOCTOR X581
Oh okay.

PATIENT X581
You get what I say?

DOCTOR X581
Uh I've heard of garlic water.

PATIENT X581
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X581
I don't know if it's really that true.

PATIENT X581
That's why it's going down @@@.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah.

PATIENT X581
Yeah so uh a buddy of mine was saying that you could take a little chopped up garlic and swallow all of it or what I've done was I've just taken chopped up some in a water bottle and I've been just swallowing that stuff in the morning and uh sometime in the evening before I go to bed.  It don't smell the best but it seem like it might helping though some.

DOCTOR X581
It's probably the medications.

PATIENT X581
(Laughter)  We put those together yes, yeah I didn't @@@.

DOCTOR X581
I wouldn't stop the medication.

PATIENT X581
Yeah I know, I know.

DOCTOR X581
@@@.

PATIENT X581
It's just.

DOCTOR X581
You ended up going back to the PM&R people to complete your therapy.

PATIENT X581
For my leg?

DOCTOR X581
Yeah.  Did you talk with them?

PATIENT X581
Uh well yeah.  What they suggested was that um I could just go for the workout system here.

DOCTOR X581
@@@.

PATIENT X581
Yeah.  They got a little @@@.  I ain't found it yet.  Do you know where it is?

DOCTOR X581
Uh we can ask outside.  Actually I've never been to it.

PATIENT X581
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X581
We put an order in so you're approved to get it.

PATIENT X581
Right, yeah, she put it all in the computer here.  But you see the thing is doc could you, I want to see the dentist you know for my teeth and what have you.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah.

PATIENT X581
And uh they said that I have to get it approved by the doctor.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah you have to have so it depends on what you need from the dentist.

PATIENT X581
Huh?

DOCTOR X581
It's not that I have to approve anything.  I just put in the order to go to the dentist.  But they'll tell what your benefits are at the office here.  If you have a active infection of any of your teeth where you have like pus pouring out of your tooth they'll see you and take care of it.  If it's a chronic problem like cavities of your teeth, they will pull your teeth out but they don't put anything in and they don't do the tooth cleaning.

PATIENT X581
@@@.

DOCTOR X581
The VA does not offer actual dental care.

PATIENT X581
Even if you didn't uh @@@.

DOCTOR X581
If you're neglecting your teeth and you have infections then they'll say okay well we can deal with this.  I'll send you to the dentist but I'm pretty confident they're gonna tell you there's nothing going on, unless they can find something in your mouth that shows there's an active infection from @@@.

PATIENT X581
Yeah I'll tell you what's going on, I feel a knot right here in my bone.  It's been there a long, sometime.  As a matter of fact when I was working and I went to the dentist he was saying that there was like an infection and if I pulled the tooth out that the knot would go away.  But the tooth ain't bad.  He said it's not the tooth, it's the bottom of the tooth.  It's the gum.  If you pull the tooth out the knot will go away.  But I don't want to do that, @@@ tooth.  You know he's twisting my arm.  I pulled the tooth out the know is still there.  That's been a year or two years ago.

DOCTOR X581
So it's probably not infection if it's been there for two years.

PATIENT X581
Uh it don't hurt anything I just wondered you know why it was still there.  He said it was gonna go away.

DOCTOR X581
I don't know, I'm not a dentist.

PATIENT X581
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X581
Um.

PATIENT X581
You ain't put @@@ or not.

DOCTOR X581
When did you start getting dizzy though?

PATIENT X581
Huh?

DOCTOR X581
When did you start getting dizzy?

PATIENT X581
Doc I'm gonna tell you ever since I been taking, start insulin, always sometimes having to be all balanced like uh feeling, they say that's part of the territory being a diabetic.

DOCTOR X581
No I mean, give me a time like an actual.  When did you start having the dizziness?  Like a year ago, six months ago, three or four years ago.  When were you started on insulin?  I don't know these details.

PATIENT X581
Okay I been on insulin for over 30, 32 to 33 years.

DOCTOR X581
Okay.  If insulin gives you dizziness, it's that your blood sugar is low.  So if you give yourself your insulin shot and your blood sugar goes to 50, then we.

PATIENT X581
It's not just dizzy; it felt like an off balance at time.  Like if you go around too quick.

DOCTOR X581
That won't be from the insulin.  It could be, if the diabetes affected your nerves.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
Cause that's @@@.

PATIENT X581
Okay I'm tending to believe cause I do have neuropathy.

DOCTOR X581
Right.

PATIENT X581
In my feet too.

DOCTOR X581
There's the nerves in your legs, there's another kind of nervous system in the body called the autonomic nervous system.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
What that does it like when you stand up.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
That's the nerves that cause the veins to constrict to get your blood back up to the body so you don't get dizzy and lightheaded and those will get damaged over the years from diabetes.

PATIENT X581
Oh, @@@ okay.

DOCTOR X581
@@@.

PATIENT X581
I gotcha, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
Um that's another type of nerve damage.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
That's a little bit tougher to treat you know.  It doesn't work like you know @@@ neuropathy and that helps.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
But there's not too many good ways to treat that.

PATIENT X581
I see.

DOCTOR X581
Other than get the glucose controlled.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
How have your blood sugars been?

PATIENT X581
Oh it's coming along pretty good.

DOCTOR X581
How is it looks pretty good?  Remember everyone has different ideas of pretty good.

PATIENT X581
I know doc, it's just that, it's down.  I'll put it that way in the morning time, sometimes like 200 uh sometimes uh like 150; it depends on what I eat that night.  I know it should be around 120 or 100.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah you'd feel better.

PATIENT X581
Ah doc, you know what I'm trying to say.  Trying to control them sometimes is almost like trying to walk, I feel like I could walk a tightrope better than I can try to get this down you know.  It's just, but it's up to me, you got to do it on your own.  All you can do is tell me what to do and give me some @@@, the rest is up to me.

DOCTOR X581
That's true.  What's holding you back?

PATIENT X581
My back?

DOCTOR X581
No what's holding you back from having good control of your blood sugars?

PATIENT X581
Oh just uh the temptation.  You might say the temptation you know uh.  It's just the temptations I guess, it's like the world and the shape that it's in today.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah.

PATIENT X581
All these holidays.  You got especially cake laying all over the table and it's hard to just walk by it and just don't get a little bitty piece.  You can do it cause you're a doctor right?

DOCTOR X581
No.

PATIENT X581
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X581
No I have the same problem.

PATIENT X581
You got that problem too huh.

DOCTOR X581
Um, so what if we just try to go up on the insulin a little bit?  Just so @@@.

PATIENT X581
Yeah, but you know what, I wasn't allowed to go up any more you know but I'll probably come down on the eating.

DOCTOR X581
Alright @@@.  

PATIENT X581
Yeah.

DOCTOR X581
As long as you understand and you have a plan.

PATIENT X581
That's where the problem is.  You know if you go up on the insulin you still go I ain't got no problem, I'm just gonna start eating more.

DOCTOR X581
Okay.  So if.

PATIENT X581
Do you know what I'm saying?

DOCTOR X581
I know what you're saying.  Just as long as you understand.

PATIENT X581
@@@.

DOCTOR X581
I gotcha.

PATIENT X581
Yeah.  I just have to stop putting too much food or overeating in my mouth, that's just what it is.

DOCTOR X581
I want to make sure you've got @@@.

PATIENT X581
Yeah I do these uh, @@@ yeah I know I.

DOCTOR X581
Do you take your vitamin D pill, it's the one with?

PATIENT X581
Yes.  I haven't taken them all yet, but I've been taking one every Monday.

DOCTOR X581
Okay.

PATIENT X581
Um I think I've got about three or four more.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah that should be right.  Just take them till you run out and when you run out let me know and we'll recheck your levels.

PATIENT X581
Okay.  But uh I'm on my last bottle of the insulin.

DOCTOR X581
Um.  (Someone comes to the door)  @@@ needs to be ordered then but the insulin you have ten refills on one of them.

PATIENT X581
On refills?

DOCTOR X581
And 11 on the other.  I think we're okay there but you just have to go pick them up.

PATIENT X581
Hmm.

DOCTOR X581
Okay.

PATIENT X581
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X581
No new orders.  

PATIENT X581
Okay so I can go over there and request.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah.

PATIENT X581
How about the one @@@ pill, the last one she gave me it seems like I'm getting a little low.  I don't know if I've got any around the house that I've lost or uh how much do.

DOCTOR X581
They're all available now.  There's like two or three refills for each one so.

PATIENT X581
But does it indicate that I need to @@@?

DOCTOR X581
Yeah it does.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
They give you a nine month's supply.

PATIENT X581
Nine months?

DOCTOR X581
Yeah.

PATIENT X581
Oh it's just that I, okay.

DOCTOR X581
You just have to get the refills.

PATIENT X581
Just got to refill them.

DOCTOR X581
So yeah it shouldn't be a problem okay.

PATIENT X581
Okay. 

DOCTOR X581
(Someone comes to the door)  Sorry PATIENT they needed directions.

PATIENT X581
That's no problem; you know I know how it is.

DOCTOR X581
So yeah the new one we gave you.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
I gave you a 90 day supply so that's three months.

PATIENT X581
Yeah because you told me to take one and then you upped it to take one in the morning and one in the evening.

DOCTOR X581
Right.  That was back in the first of November or.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
There was 90 pills given.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
At that time so.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
That should last you three months and then you have two refills from there.

PATIENT X581
That should last for how long?

DOCTOR X581
90 pills.

PATIENT X581
Should last for.

DOCTOR X581
You're taking half a tablet in the morning, half in the afternoon.

PATIENT X581
No I'm taking a whole.

DOCTOR X581
You're taking a whole?

PATIENT X581
You switched it to a whole one; somebody did to a whole one in the morning and a whole one in the evening.

DOCTOR X581
Oh okay well then.

PATIENT X581
Did you see who ordered it?

DOCTOR X581
They didn't change the order.

PATIENT X581
Maybe you could change that.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah I'll change that so that they.

PATIENT X581
Yeah.  You know I don't want to get mixed up because one doctor says one thing and one doctor changes it back again.

DOCTOR X581
No, no, I'm glad you did, I gotcha.  I'm glad you brought that in.

PATIENT X581
Yeah.

DOCTOR X581
Oh the renal doctor did.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
The kidney doctor okay.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.  So then let's watch it, looks like that supply is getting a little low huh.

DOCTOR X581
That's fine I'll refill it, no problem.

PATIENT X581
Is it okay with you?

DOCTOR X581
Yeah of course.

PATIENT X581
I mean to up the dose.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah well you can go as high as we need to get your blood pressure under control.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
When you saw the kidney doctors your blood pressure is still looking good.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
They look at the decision where.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
But it's like you said you know it's up to you.

PATIENT X581
Right.

DOCTOR X581
If we don't control your blood pressure, if we don't control your diabetes.

PATIENT X581
Right.

DOCTOR X581
You will be on dialysis.

PATIENT X581
Right.

DOCTOR X581
If you live long enough to get there.  You want to be dialysis?

PATIENT X581
No.  Is that ya'll want?

DOCTOR X581
Of course not.

PATIENT X581
Me either.

DOCTOR X581
So if somebody tells me to take the higher dose of medication, I'm okay with it and you should be with it too if it means your blood pressure goes lower and you're 120/70 is where your blood pressure is now.  That's where you should be being that you have diabetes.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
If it's ever above that, every day it's above that you're hurting your kidneys.  Same thing with the blood sugars.  So you got to really start working on the eating.  You don't want on more insulin and I'll respect your wishes then you've got to get with it with the food.

PATIENT X581
You're right.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah.  If you're gonna eat all of.

PATIENT X581
Yeah.

DOCTOR X581
But that means we kick you in the pants sometimes though.

PATIENT X581
Yeah, yeah.  You only doing your job by telling me what to do.  It's up to me.

DOCTOR X581
Absolutely.  Do you have any questions or anything right now?

PATIENT X581
Yeah do need me to see somebody else, you supposed to see @@@.

DOCTOR X581
With what.

PATIENT X581
In my ears.

DOCTOR X581
In your ears, yeah what's going on with your ears?

PATIENT X581
I still got this ringing in my ears.

DOCTOR X581
Oh yeah sorry the ringing.  Uh when did that start?

PATIENT X581
Oh it's going when I started taking these last pills, the blood pressure pills that you gave me.  I'm thinking it might come from that.  Is that possible?  That you can get a ringing in the ear?  I mean basically it's in this ear and sometimes you know it'll clog up sometimes.  Maybe it's @@@ I don't know.

DOCTOR X581
I'll take a look.  This is not a medication that usually causes ringing in the ear.

PATIENT X581
Okay.  No medications do that.

DOCTOR X581
No a lot of medications can.  The one you're on doesn't.

PATIENT X581
Oh it doesn't.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
And to be honest with you, if you said, it might be part of the reason that it was the ringing in the ears, @@@ with the blood pressure.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
@@@.  Sometimes it's in your best interest just to deal with it.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
Cause it's keeping your blood pressure in place and we don't have any other blood pressure medications to give you @@@.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
You're on everything else already.  So we'll take a look and see.  Do you clean your ears regularly?

PATIENT X581
Um maybe once a week.

DOCTOR X581
What do you use to clean them?

PATIENT X581
What?

DOCTOR X581
What do you use to clean them?

PATIENT X581
Basically just the end of the towel, something like that you know.  Sometimes I don't feel, I think it's just the right ear.  When I put @@@ the first time I went in on this side and when I get it it just stops up.

DOCTOR X581
So this particular thing, if it's only one ear it's not the symptoms of the blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X581
Hmm.

DOCTOR X581
This oh okay I can tell you right now, I can't see into it.

PATIENT X581
What's up?

DOCTOR X581
It's covered in wax all the rest of the way.

PATIENT X581
Yeah, is that right?

DOCTOR X581
Yeah like I can't even see it. 

PATIENT X581
Well my wife has said why don't you get the doctor to look in your ears and see what's wrong, you can't hear nothing.

DOCTOR X581
You can't even see into it.

PATIENT X581
Both of them?

DOCTOR X581
This one, this is the one that's totally clogged all the way.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
I'll give you some drops to use in it.

PATIENT X581
Okay.  Thank you.

DOCTOR X581
Um.  Have a seat here.  

PATIENT X581
Does fish, baked fish is good for you @@@ too.

DOCTOR X581
Yeah baked fish.  Baked fish or grilled fish.  Fried fish is not good for you.

PATIENT X581
Cause I'm trying to, I've been eating it for the last week or so and man I mean, my sugars are all the way down when I eat fish.

DOCTOR X581
Your sugar is good.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
Are they good @@@.

PATIENT X581
Yeah it works real good but it's just you know you get tired of just eating white fish and eat something else.  Could be @@@.

DOCTOR X581
I ordered those drops and I want to take a look at your feet okay.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
Just lay back.  @@@ you can pick up the ear drops and there's instructions on them on how to use them but basically you put the ear drop in, you let it sit there while it dissolves the wax.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
Turn the ear over and let it drain out.  You don't put anything in there to scrape it out.

PATIENT X581
Hmm.

DOCTOR X581
Or remove it yourself okay.

PATIENT X581
Just let the drop and it's dissolving it right.

DOCTOR X581
Yes.  Open your mouth, stick your tongue out.

PATIENT X581
@@@.

DOCTOR X581
This thing?

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
How long has that been there?

PATIENT X581
Too long, couple of years.

DOCTOR X581
Let me get you in to see the maxillofacial people it looks like something for the oral surgeons.

PATIENT X581
Yeah.

DOCTOR X581
We can have you see them and get a work-up for this.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
Um.  I'm thinking @@@ diabetes, you know @@@.

PATIENT X581
@@@.

DOCTOR X581
That's a large growth in your mouth.

PATIENT X581
Yeah.

DOCTOR X581
Deep breath.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
Okay.  Yeah you know I'm kind of confused what that is myself.  When you were describing it I thought it was gonna be a small bump.  It's definitely not infection.  It's a large growth of tissue there.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
So we'll have the facial, the oral facial surgeon who specialize in the jaws.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
And the bones of the face, we'll have them take a look at it to see if they could do a biopsy here.

PATIENT X581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X581
Okay.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
How long has it been there?

PATIENT X581
I'd say two years or more.

DOCTOR X581
Does it get bigger or is it staying the same size?

PATIENT X581
Hmm it might be a little bit bigger but it doesn't seem to get any smaller.  

DOCTOR X581
Are you smoking?

PATIENT X581
No.

DOCTOR X581
Did you smoke when you were younger?

PATIENT X581
Um yeah when I was, like 20s or something like that.

DOCTOR X581
How long did you smoke for?

PATIENT X581
Oh it was about, off and on, I guess about five, six years.

DOCTOR X581
Let me go tell my boss what we're doing today.  Basically we're gonna do the drops.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
And see if he needs to see you okay.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
Alright.

PATIENT X581
And make the appointment for the oral surgeon at the same time?

DOCTOR X581
Yes.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  56:53  DOCTOR IN:  62:05)

DOCTOR X581
Okay.  I talked to my boss; he's okay with that plan.  You can take that to the service clerk and she will give you an appointment to see Oral Surgery or they'll send an appointment in the mail to you.  The next time I'm going to see you it'll be two months @@@.

PATIENT X581
Okay.

DOCTOR X581
Good enough.

PATIENT X581
@@@.  

DOCTOR X581
Yeah do you need anything?

PATIENT X581

DOCTOR X581

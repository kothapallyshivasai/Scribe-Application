PATIENT X633
Thank you @@@.

DOCTOR X633
And uh that's something that's gonna affect your health in addition to, you know we're worried about your health but it being illegal we don't really care so much about but.

PATIENT X633
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X633
But it does cause health problem so we need to try to get you off of that.  About how frequently have you been using it?

PATIENT X633
I'd say about once or twice a week.

DOCTOR X633
And the last time I saw you was maybe December or January.

PATIENT X633
It was in November actually.

DOCTOR X633
In November, the end of November that I saw you the last time um and then when did you restart?

PATIENT X633
I started about a month ago.

DOCTOR X633
Okay so you had some time where you were able to avoid it um.

PATIENT X633
But um the program I was in was a good program cause you know it @@@ you know it was like @@@.  I feel better that I did you know did a program and um it was a good program and I was just, you know boredom or whatever I you know I slipped in there but I have @@@.  So instead of every day it's like once or twice a week you know.  That's still not good but it's slowly down over 75%.

DOCTOR X633
That's good and I think and actually to get you off of it again and keep you off of it.

PATIENT X633
Yeah.

DOCTOR X633
So hopefully working with them again will hopefully get you there um.  

PATIENT X633
@@@ to myself, @@@ eyes don't lie you know.

DOCTOR X633
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X633
And @@@.

DOCTOR X633
@@@.

PATIENT X633
It was the eyes.  Uh really because you're a doctor though, come on man.

DOCTOR X633
Uh you know uh we want what's best for you.

PATIENT X633
Yes.

DOCTOR X633
And to do that we need to know the truth and even if you say, even if you don't do what we tell you, we want to know about it.

PATIENT X633
Right.

DOCTOR X633
Make sure that we can organize.

PATIENT X633
Right, right.

DOCTOR X633
Your care so.  We uh, we're not here to pass any judgment.

PATIENT X633
Right.

DOCTOR X633
We'll just give you advice.  That's what we do.  We'll give you advice and if you take it that's great.

PATIENT X633
I appreciate the whole VA System and everything like that but um I mean the friends of mine, they don't have, they don't have the options that I have.

DOCTOR X633
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X633
So.  Um I've been bothered since 86 and actually this is the first time I've been using it, the program.  I had a tooth pulled back in '91 but aside that I don't know, I need to improve it.  I wish I knew more about it then. 

DOCTOR X633
Uh let's see.  So it looks like uh you never got the colonoscopy, it looks like.

PATIENT X633
No sir.

DOCTOR X633
Um is that something you wanted to do now or do you want to hold off for now?

PATIENT X633
I'd be willing to do that.

DOCTOR X633
Alright we'll put it back in.

PATIENT X633
Is that recommended or?

DOCTOR X633
Yeah so the reason we do it is because um, once you get above 50 your risk of colon cancer is increased and uh this is the way we can see it early, treat it.  Sometimes it's something small, which usually it is, if we see you regularly they can just take it out and then that'll be the end of it.  Um whereas if it becomes something that we miss um you know maybe you'd be able to go for you know maybe you wouldn't get it during your lifetime and wouldn't have any problems but it you would then it would become advanced and then that causes more problems and it's been shown to be effective in taking care of it early on.  Uh can I take a look at your feet?  Take your shoes and socks off.  Set things up.

PATIENT X633
I've got the pain right here.  

DOCTOR X633
Okay.  Where is the pain mostly in the morning?

PATIENT X633
On most of the morning, it's right here.

DOCTOR X633
Oh through there.

PATIENT X633
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X633
Okay.  Um I'm going to poke you with this, see if you can feel it.

PATIENT X633
I feel like a tapping.

DOCTOR X633

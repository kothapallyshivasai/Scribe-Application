So you mentioned that you were bleeding from the ulcer?

PATIENT X34
Uh yeah I was taking medication for arthritis in my hip.

Well I got an ulcer.  I've had a leg ulcer that's been there for a long long time.

DOCTOR X34
Okay.

PATIENT X34
And uh, and uh that was there, actually that was there before the hip replacement so.

DOCTOR X34
Okay since then you have had it, okay.

PATIENT X34
But this is, it was probably worse, gets better and then it gets worse.  It's not even worth having anything.

DOCTOR X34
But the cellulitis @@@ that was much worse than what you @@@.

PATIENT X34
Oh the whole leg was swelled and inflamed.

DOCTOR X34

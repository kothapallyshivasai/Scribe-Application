DOCTOR X411
How are you?

PATIENT X411
Good.  I was falling asleep over there.

DOCTOR X411
@@@.

PATIENT X411
What's that?

DOCTOR X411
@@@.  Uh once a year I'll find something @@@ send you here um @@@ get the reports were normal.

PATIENT X411
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah exactly.  Uh how you doing overall?

PATIENT X411
Um I still have that cough.

DOCTOR X411
Still have that cough huh.

PATIENT X411
Yeah.  It um hasn't got any better um.  As a matter of fact it's gotten um I think its a little worse um.  I believe, I'm getting heart palpitations and I think it might be from that uh because I think it's something I get not only at the time I cough or right before I cough.  I haven't figured it out before or after I cough it seems like I've been getting little heart palpitations.

DOCTOR X411
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X411
And I know @@@ causing me problems.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah and you had a stress test recently.  You had a TSH if I recall.  Uh.

PATIENT X411
What do all these numbers mean?

DOCTOR X411
Cause your stress test is pretty much to see if you're having any more problems with palpitations or its just decreased blood flow to your heart, serious heart problems.

PATIENT X411
We did that last year I think it was, wasn't it?

DOCTOR X411
Yeah, yeah.  That's something maybe you got it in the last year.

PATIENT X411
Yeah we did it last year.  I remember that.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.  Um we ended up getting a TSH cause we concerned about the thyroid hormone and your thyroid hormone was elevated @@@ through that but now it's normal.  Uh we checked your cholesterol once again this also @@@ you know blood flow to your heart, cholesterol is high then it could be what causes palpitations but that was all normal.

PATIENT X411
Okay.

DOCTOR X411
So um the reason I ordered the pulmonary function tests, another one of the most probable causes of a cough is @@@ and you don't have that.  Uh so there are other @@@ cause of cough actually, there are two other causes.  One is reflux.  Reflux can actually cause a cough @@@ asthma @@@.  So um do you have reflux after you eat?

PATIENT X411
You know I didn't know what's going on here um I think um a while back they gave me some pills cause they was thinking it was acid reflux.  That was before the uh @@@ attack that you just described uh the cardio test or that pulmonary test, that was before that.  They gave me some medication um which actually caused one of the side effects and I read those things, like those things.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
I read them.

DOCTOR X411
Sir we're talking about.

PATIENT X411
And when they started that I was coughing.  So you ask me will it really do any good, I took these pills so I think maybe 30 days.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
Three or four weeks.

DOCTOR X411
Do you know what pill it was?

PATIENT X411
Be in my records, I don't remember the name of it.  But um that was supposed, I guess @@@ the cause but they was discussing acid reflux and uh cause I know about acid reflux.  This is something you can feel like in your throat like you're about to throw up or something.

DOCTOR X411
Uh I know.

PATIENT X411
They said no this could be going on in my stomach and I wouldn't feel it.  But one of the side effects was coughing so how are you going to get someone on medication for coughing when one of the side effects is coughing?

DOCTOR X411
Well I mean.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Right these side effects @@@ often times are more severe like @@@.  For example I can say nausea and vomiting, you'll see nausea and vomiting or GI upset or everything like it, but it doesn't mean that you've never had it.  Uh they got you improved so even after we've improved your cough there is no multiple way to have control of uh and well-documented uh trials showing that these @@@ are going to help the cough.

PATIENT X411
Well when you come back and you say well it didn't do any good.

DOCTOR X411
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X411
So my answer to that is I don't know.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.  Well @@@.

PATIENT X411
@@@ cough.

DOCTOR X411
If it didn't suppress the cough @@@.

PATIENT X411
Yeah.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
If you cough but @@@ affect it.

DOCTOR X411
No, no right.

PATIENT X411
Any other side effects?

DOCTOR X411
No it's very simple.

PATIENT X411
Oh.

DOCTOR X411
Did the medication, did your coughing stop after you started taking the medication?

PATIENT X411
No.

DOCTOR X411
Okay so it didn't help.  

PATIENT X411
Um and I guess I've been noticing I mean when I get up in the morning I'm okay and usually after I eat you know later on in the day is when the cough starts, starting back.  So I'm thinking am I having an allergic reaction to something um.

DOCTOR X411
I'm sorry what?

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Repeat what you just said I'm sorry.

PATIENT X411
I said in the morning time it seems to be okay.  Then later on in the day is when it starts, after I eat something.  So I start to notice that.  I don't eat a lot of acidic foods.  That's one thing about this I do eat acidic foods so I'm thinking am I allergic to something cause I try to keep my @@@ down in my day.  I take pills for that.

DOCTOR X411
What are you taking?

PATIENT X411
Uh well I take a thing that's @@@, that's alca @@@.  But you know I don't take them every day.  No I just kind of watch my pH to have a pH @@@.  I don't take this stuff an awfully lot.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
Well that's gonna help you because you have um acidic bodies as well.

DOCTOR X411
Well I mean actually you know, those medications can result in uh.  You're talking about altering the pH @@@ um which.

PATIENT X411
Yeah.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah you can do that but uh often times @@@ and the reason why is because the bacteria, the reason why your @@@ low pH for one reason @@@ uh but that uh @@@ bacteria yeah.

PATIENT X411
I think that was supposed to @@@.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah so uh it keeps the pH at a very low level to slow bacteria up here so if you're @@@ high reflux you know you can aspirate some of the reflux um it won't be filled with bacteria, you know what I'm saying.  Um so I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing that.  Uh what we kind of do though, I mean uh how long have you been on it?  Are you still taking the omeprazole?  Are you still taking that?

PATIENT X411
I think it was a 30 day supply.

DOCTOR X411
30.

PATIENT X411
Yeah two weeks or 30, something like that.  Two to four weeks.

DOCTOR X411
Three refills @@@ on.  And you say you took it only for 30 days or did you take it for less than that?

PATIENT X411
I just took whatever was in the bottle.

DOCTOR X411
What was in the bottle.

PATIENT X411
I didn't refill it.

DOCTOR X411
And it didn't help you at all?

PATIENT X411
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X411
Okay alright.  Uh usually three month trials.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah let me see what DOCTOR thinks about that.  The other thing that it possibly could be is uh people end up having postnasal dripping and uh postnasal drips occurs.  What it sounds like to me, it sounded like reflux coughing because you're saying that it occurs after you eat um and that you notice when you wake up in the morning and it occurred after you eat um.  You know the postnasal drip cough is a little bit different because the postnasal drip cough occurs at night when you lay back down, you get it then.  So now, omeprazole like with a reflux cough @@@ too.  That's a very common reason for @@@ when you lay down you cough @@@.  But I mean it sounds like it occurs after you eat, that's what you were saying.  So it very well could just be that I mean you need a higher dose of the omeprazole.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Okay, alright. 

PATIENT X411
That one didn't work.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
So I don't, I mean if I double up on something that doesn't work.

DOCTOR X411
Well I mean it could just be the fact that you need a higher dose you know.

PATIENT X411
Yeah.  My body is supposed to take care of itself.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
And that's what I don't want to take pills to take care of this stuff so why. I don't suspect the cough.

DOCTOR X411
Well @@@.

PATIENT X411
I want to find out what's causing it.

DOCTOR X411
Well sometimes it's very difficult to find out what's causing it.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
And I wouldn't expect and @@@ is suppressing the cough, you're not suppressing the cause what you're doing is you're ending up treating the cough and that is the way you go about finding out how, what the cause is.  If you end up taking the omeprazole and it actually works then that is the cause.  You understand?

PATIENT X411
@@@.  I think if I have a problem and I take something that suppresses the cough or makes me feel comfortable with it, what stops, then I'm taking the pill and I @@@.

DOCTOR X411
Uh well if @@@.

PATIENT X411
What's causing me, what's causing acid reflux?

DOCTOR X411
Very common.

PATIENT X411
Is it the food that I'm eating or I wouldn't think so because I'm not eating acidic foods so I'm starting to watch what foods I eat.

DOCTOR X411
Do you drink coffee in the morning?

PATIENT X411
No I do not.  I do not drink coffee no.

DOCTOR X411
Well first of all right now we don't even know whether it's reflux or not so I mean, so I mean I think it sounds like reflux to me but if you're not willing to take the omeprazole then we'll see what else, I mean that's not something that we need to do.  The other thing is @@@ it seems like @@@ are out of it.

PATIENT X411
See my thing is that the problem keeps coming and the pills take care of it and dilutes the acid in my stomach that means yeah the pill dilutes the acid in my stomach then I stop coughing.

DOCTOR X411
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X411
But the problem still exists.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah well sometimes you can't, you can't.

PATIENT X411
I want to know what the problem is.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
So if you're gonna be taking something and we don't know what the problem is.  We don't even know if it's acid reflux.  I take the pills, like they asked me to.  I took their pills.

DOCTOR X411
Right.

PATIENT X411
It didn't help.

DOCTOR X411
Right.

PATIENT X411
I took them @@@, they didn't help.

DOCTOR X411
Sure yeah.

PATIENT X411
Uh it didn't help at all.

DOCTOR X411
Okay.

PATIENT X411
So to me @@@.

DOCTOR X411
So it didn't help at all then that's surprising.  Uh like I said I would admit that doesn't fit, doesn't fit here.  And you're right @@@ didn't help at all, that's the problem @@@.

PATIENT X411
It gotta work.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah, yeah and then the other that we can possibly do is we could once again is trial, but what we'd do is we'd give you a trial of medication and we'll see if it works.  If it works then that's the cause.  That's the way that it works.

PATIENT X411
If it works, it helps resolve.

DOCTOR X411
Exactly.

PATIENT X411
The issue but it doesn't cause.

DOCTOR X411
It doesn't cure the problem.

PATIENT X411
It doesn't cure the problem right.

DOCTOR X411
Well unfortunately we don't have a lot that we can cure problems with.

PATIENT X411
Yeah.

DOCTOR X411
@@@.

PATIENT X411
I want to find out why.

DOCTOR X411
Some of it's genetic.

PATIENT X411
Well I'm happy not to @@@.

DOCTOR X411
Okay.

PATIENT X411
I mean because my diet and I changed my diet.

DOCTOR X411
How's everything else going for you other than the cough?

PATIENT X411
Heart palpitations I don't know if it's being caused by the cough.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah we can give you some.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Well I totally understand.  When you get, we can give you something called a Holter monitor.  Have you ever had one of those?

PATIENT X411
@@@ thing that monitors the beat of the heart.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.  So it monitors the beat of the heart but it monitors it for 24 hours and when you're telling me is you have heart palpitations almost every day, when you cough right?  Whenever you cough?

PATIENT X411
Yeah I think it just recently started in the last week or two.

DOCTOR X411
We have here, you know, I have it documented for like the last time you were here that you had heart palpitations.

PATIENT X411
Yeah that was like May.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah and that was back in, let's see it was back in uh let's see.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Back in November.

PATIENT X411
Yeah, November?

DOCTOR X411
Yeah and.

PATIENT X411
Last month?

DOCTOR X411
Last month.

PATIENT X411
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X411
And then.

PATIENT X411
Okay.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah and I have it again back in August of 2009 and then I have it back in.

PATIENT X411
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah so I mean.

PATIENT X411
So it's been doing this.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah actually you had it back in 2008 that you'd been having heart palpitations.

PATIENT X411
Yeah it's getting worse then.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah um okay.

PATIENT X411
But now I get it almost daily, I didn't get them daily back then.

DOCTOR X411
Well we can go ahead and give you a Holter monitor.

PATIENT X411
Okay.

DOCTOR X411
And uh see how you do.

PATIENT X411
Do I have to cough up something?  

DOCTOR X411
No it just monitors your heart.

PATIENT X411
For the acid reflux.

DOCTOR X411
Um I don't think so, not that I know of.

PATIENT X411
@@@ what causes it?

DOCTOR X411
Um anxiety.

PATIENT X411
Hmm.

DOCTOR X411
That could cause it.

PATIENT X411
I could definitely have that.

DOCTOR X411
I mean.

PATIENT X411
Stress.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.  Definitely.

PATIENT X411
Fatigue.

DOCTOR X411
That could cause it.

PATIENT X411
Cause I been trying to get more rest.

DOCTOR X411
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X411
I definitely try to get more rest since that started happening @@@.  So I been trying to get more rest.  The last couple of nights I been having @@@ seems like I get like four hours @@@.

DOCTOR X411
@@@.

PATIENT X411
Well it's definitely on my mind.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
You know @@@ I'm aware of that.  @@@ before.  So that's why I need to bring it down and try to eliminate all the things that causes stress so maybe that.

DOCTOR X411
You know.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah that's good.

PATIENT X411
It helps.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah I know it does.

PATIENT X411
Yeah I need to get more of that.  @@@.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah um.  When do the palpitations occurs other than the coughing.  Do they ever occur without the coughing?

PATIENT X411
I'm thinking it's more the cough and I'm just trying to remember you know um.

DOCTOR X411
I mean if you.

PATIENT X411
I don't need to have any more.

DOCTOR X411
If you cough a lot.  If you end up coughing a lot and your heart, your starts going faster in response to it.

PATIENT X411
So that's what's causing it.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.  It very well could be that.  But you know we have to make sure that it's not necessarily a serious kind of palpitations.  Like I mean first of all it could be severe serious problems and non-serious problems causing the palpitations okay.  Uh serious causes @@@ you know your heart's improperly beating so um and non-serious causes are I mean I'm sure that they're causes you know but at least you have the comfort of having a non-serious causes @@@ you know your heart beats irregularly for a couple of beats and then it comes back to normal.  So we can get, if you get the Holter monitor we can watch it for 24 hours and I mean you can just be walking around you know doing your everyday things and it will be analyzed and uh we'll go from there.

PATIENT X411
Okay.

DOCTOR X411
Okay.

PATIENT X411
With that I'm just going to get the heart beat, I don't know if it monitors the breathing as well.

DOCTOR X411
No, it'll monitor your heart and everything but I mean the palpitations, the cause of it is the heart so.  I mean everything in the heart works, it could be just your anxiety but we'll at least be able to find out with the heart monitor.

PATIENT X411
With that, okay.  That's a little more cardiac stuff I guess.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah that always helps.  Exercise is excellent.

PATIENT X411
I want to do more cardiac stuff.  Cause I know exercises can do more cardio stuff.

DOCTOR X411
Where you lift?

PATIENT X411
Yeah I need to do more cardiac.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah I was going to say I lift but I don't @@@.

PATIENT X411
Yeah I did real good when I @@@.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah that is pretty cool.

PATIENT X411
Then I think I'm fat.  @@@ more fat.

DOCTOR X411
@@@.

PATIENT X411
@@@ just to see if I cough.

DOCTOR X411
Sure.

PATIENT X411
And on the days I cough I want to see if it's after I eat.

DOCTOR X411
Sure, yeah.  That monitor's.

PATIENT X411
See if that occurs.

DOCTOR X411
Try that, yeah that's a real good idea.  Uh.

PATIENT X411
Well I'm @@@ the body makes you change.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
So I'm just gonna have to watch my body.

DOCTOR X411
Alright let's @@@.

PATIENT X411
I'll take it cause this coughing @@@.  You know we had this back in, you know I had the palpitations but not the cough.  I had to come into the Emergency Room with that.

DOCTOR X411
Really.  For what?

PATIENT X411
I had palpitations um @@@.  Think it was last year, in 08 I think that was.  They put me on monitoring.  They monitored me for a few hours.  They took an EKG on me and everything.  

DOCTOR X411
Yeah so what we see, an EKG is just like a shock, it's like what's occurring as body @@@ it's like a picture right.  Now this, the Holter monitor is a video recording.  So when you're walking I mean you just go through your activities every day you know and so it kind of sees your every day life and it sees how your heart reacts to it so.  You know like I mean if you're not having palpitations at that minute and they did the EKG then it doesn't mean anything right?

PATIENT X411
Right, right.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
This is the smart way.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
So whenever it happens it's going to record it.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah and it usually happens during the day.  Sometimes the Holter monitor during those 24 hours might not have any palpitations at all so you know it @@@.  But if you're having palpitations, you actually have heart palpitations then you know let's, just they can still take a look at it and we'll see what happens.  So when you actually get the Holter monitor, remember whether you had palpitations that day okay.  Okay check your other labs real quick.

PATIENT X411
Did you see whether I had any more refills for all the pills you gave me?

DOCTOR X411
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X411
I need a refill for um; I think it was DOCTOR from Dermatology.

DOCTOR X411
Oh, now what was it?  Is it the hydrocortisone, what was it?

PATIENT X411
I think it was um.

DOCTOR X411
When was the last time you saw Dermatology?  Do you remember?

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
Here we go.

PATIENT X411
Uh.

DOCTOR X411
You're on Retin A cream.

PATIENT X411
Retin A right.

DOCTOR X411
Yeah no problem.

PATIENT X411
That'd be good.

DOCTOR X411
@@@.  Is there anything else you need?

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
@@@.

PATIENT X411
Yeah that kind of concern me more @@@ cough is when the palpitations kick in @@@, four or five times a day you know @@@.

DOCTOR X411
How long do they last when it comes on?

PATIENT X411
It's like an interruption you know I guess.

DOCTOR X411
And do you get any chest pain just palpitations?  Any shortness of breath?  I mean you can take a deep breath right, @@@ occasionally?

PATIENT X411
Well no, I @@@ no more of that.  I need to do more cardiac okay.  Maybe lifting more I mean, I @@@ doing push-ups and I can push them up you know.

DOCTOR X411
Oh okay, yeah.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

DOCTOR X411
How many push-ups do you do?

PATIENT X411
Well I used to run.  I maybe do about; I mean I do about 60.

DOCTOR X411
Okay so about an hour.

PATIENT X411
And then I stop.

DOCTOR X411
Okay.

PATIENT X411
And then the only thing I maybe do 25, so probably like 100 pull-ups, you know five minutes.

DOCTOR X411
I think you're heart's in good shape though.  Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT X411
Alright thanks doctor.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:33  DOCTOR IN:  53:09)

SECOND DOCTOR X411
@@@.  Hi sir, I'm DOCTOR nice to see you.

PATIENT X411
That's right.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Is this a problem that you have?

PATIENT X411
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
So that's the problem okay.  Now I'm just perusing those notes on what is causing the cough.  So your breathing has been fine, no sign of asthma um @@@ reason why and it's also because of increased @@@ acid reflux.  That can be making you cough right.

PATIENT X411
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
You said that you have coughing no @@@ back of your throat?

PATIENT X411
No postnasal drip or anything like that no.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Okay you don't have any.  So @@@ sinus x-ray cause you've had some sinusitis in the past.  That's another common cause for um.

PATIENT X411
I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
@@@.

PATIENT X411
An infection that I had when I was in the service.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Okay, @@@ some symptoms from that @@@.  Smoking, you don't smoke.

PATIENT X411
No I don't.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
And do you get it in the morning when you wake up, when do you actually start coughing?

PATIENT X411
Uh I'm noticing I'm trying to diagnose it, diagnose it myself.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
And I think it's been more like, when I get up in the morning I'm not coughing.  Usually after I eat and so sure but I think it's after I eat.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Okay.

PATIENT X411
Then uh a little bit later on I start to cough.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Okay.

PATIENT X411
But I don't know if it's because I eat.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X411
Or it's because it's later on in the day so I was just telling the doc here @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
@@@.  So you have coffee @@@.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
And uh.

PATIENT X411
Coffee cause it, yeah I drink a little coffee here and there but not recently I haven't been.  @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Okay.

PATIENT X411
So changes in my health habits.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X411
I haven't drinking as much coffee, maybe one cup @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Yeah.

PATIENT X411
Um.

FIRST DOCTOR X411
Any Cokes or anything like that?  Caffeine would be thing we're looking for.  

PATIENT X411
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X411
No sodas throughout the day?

PATIENT X411
Uh I usually do @@@ caffeine in them, some of them do have caffeine in them but I haven't even been doing that recently.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Oh um.

PATIENT X411
You know so.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
And when they were emphatically treating you um you know and the fact they gave you a diagnosis of acid reflux um, we could do @@@ eating you could you know get a formal upper GI where they have you swallow the barium and see if there is obstruction and with acid reflux they do the same thing.  Um and it's causing you to have more severe @@@ pain.  Uh so we could check if you're aspirating and this is causing, so if you can just get an upper GI @@@.

PATIENT X411
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Um so that could be something we could do.  And @@@ why.

PATIENT X411
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
@@@ know why.

PATIENT X411
Yeah do that.  It seems like phlegm gets @@@ in my throat.  Yeah it seems like that.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Okay.  And then I will be right back.

PATIENT X411
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Oh okay.  So @@@ is normal.

FIRST DOCTOR X411
Uh I believe so @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
You could send him to the see the ENT doctor for @@@ for a day or two and um they also could see @@@ uh reflux affecting your vocal cords or something @@@.  Um you know we could do @@@ or we could just order the upper GI and see what it comes back as um.

PATIENT X411
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
@@@.  Yeah so, um so we could do that yeah.

PATIENT X411
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
I'll have @@@ set you up for that test and if you don't want to take meds then we'll go up the next time okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X411
Well he's not taking anything.

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Okay yeah we'll see what we see um.

FIRST DOCTOR X411
So we'll set him up for an EGD correct?

SECOND DOCTOR X411
Um, @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X411

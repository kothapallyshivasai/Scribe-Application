DOCTOR X130
PATIENT?

PATIENT X130 
Yes ma'am.  How are you today?

DOCTOR X130
I'm good, how are you?

PATIENT X130
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X130
@@@.

PATIENT X130
@@@.

DOCTOR X130
Really.  @@@.

PATIENT X130
You know what @@@ a couple weeks ago I came in, I came into the hospital and I have like a stomach pain or something.

DOCTOR X130
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X130
And um this is from someone in Primary Care and DOCTOR, she suggested I get a course of action which I follow and it seems to resolve itself.  She said @@@ for 24 hours or a subsequent 24 hour period to be on a liquid diet.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130
She said to allow my colon and things to kind of relax.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130
At any rate that seems to have occurred and then this morning I woke up and I had an explosive case of diarrhea.

DOCTOR X130
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X130
And then you know what, sitting there waiting for you it occurred to me what happened to me and I know what I did.

DOCTOR X130
What'd you do?

PATIENT X130
I bought a brand new stove.

DOCTOR X130
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X130
And I had the stove put in on Thursday.

DOCTOR X130
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X130
And yesterday was the first time that I actually fried something in it.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130
And I fried some chicken.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130
And chicken fried too quickly and what I did was, I bit into that chicken and when I bit into a few parts, I realized after I saw I looked at the bone and everything, I realized that chicken wasn't done.

DOCTOR X130
@@@.

PATIENT X130
It wasn't cooked right.  So what I did with the subsequent pieces that I made and I smothered them.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130
To make sure they were done but I think what gave me the stomach trauma was that piece of chicken that I ate.

DOCTOR X130
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X130
It wasn't done.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130
That can do it can't it?

DOCTOR X130
Oh sure.

PATIENT X130
Uh-huh and I think that's what it is.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.  So @@@ made this appointment is for this abdominal pain?

PATIENT X130
That's right uh-huh.

DOCTOR X130
And nothing else okay.  How long would that have been?

PATIENT X130
Oh it started at 7:15 this morning.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.  When did you eat the chicken though?

PATIENT X130
Last night.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130
And I put some, took sedatives and went to sleep and slept through the night.

DOCTOR X130
Okay.

PATIENT X130

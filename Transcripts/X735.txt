PATIENT X735
Okay.

DOCTOR X735
And yeah she can come in and sort of give her input too and @@@ depending on how she @@@.  Yeah it looks like the last time you were here was December.  At that time did you get a flu shot in November?  Okay.  And how have you been since then?  

PATIENT X735
Uh the only problem I had was I was taking the anti-virus test, cholesterol level was @@@ and I ran out of it and they wouldn't refill it because I had some problems with VA finance.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah.

PATIENT X735
Coordinated.

DOCTOR X735
Did they refill it eventually?

PATIENT X735
Yeah.

DOCTOR X735
You still have it?  Okay.

PATIENT X735
Uh I don't need this, as far as I know, because when I was here the last time she said all of the.

DOCTOR X735
The labs looked good.

PATIENT X735
Everything seems to be within normal range so uh.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah.

PATIENT X735
I have no side effects and no problems not taking it and uh it was a hyper cholesterol. 

DOCTOR X735
Yeah when you got the labs this morning um did you eat beforehand at all or no?

PATIENT X735
No.

DOCTOR X735
Okay.  Sorry one second.  So it's a little elevated, your LDL is 161 and we want to see it under 120 um so and it's been a couple weeks or months would you say since you've been off of that cholesterol medication?

PATIENT X735
Oh I'd say two months.

DOCTOR X735
Two months okay.

PATIENT X735
But at 161, it's supposed to be 120 @@@.

DOCTOR X735
Right, right, yeah.

PATIENT X735
@@@.

DOCTOR X735
You know we'll talk to her, just looking at your you know history of high blood pressure, things like that, you know you're at a little more risk for things to happen so um.

PATIENT X735
Well I'm using kind of a diet and exercise program uh.

DOCTOR X735
Hmm.

PATIENT X735
Maybe more of a vegetarian diet.

DOCTOR X735
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X735
And uh.

DOCTOR X735
When you were on the statin, did you have any muscle pains, aches, anything like that?  Not really okay.  The other labs look good.  

PATIENT X735
I may have had muscles pains or aches but I don't think they were induced by the statin.

DOCTOR X735
Okay, it's a real short thing.

PATIENT X735
I exercise, I lift weights.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah, okay.

PATIENT X735
I'm accustomed to pain.

DOCTOR X735
Gotcha.

PATIENT X735
But I didn't have any chronic.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah, yeah, taking your medicine all the time okay.  Blood count looks good.

PATIENT X735
What was the uh 120 today or 160 today?

DOCTOR X735
Uh the cholesterol was 160.

PATIENT X735
Yeah so I'm 40 off.

DOCTOR X735
It's still big enough that you know.

PATIENT X735
Yeah cause my blood pressure is increased.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah the blood pressure looks uh.

PATIENT X735

DOCTOR X735
Nothing's coming back or okay.  Uh any urinary complaints at all or?  Not really.  And uh what about back pain, any problems with that?

PATIENT X735
The only back pain I get is when I lift weights.

DOCTOR X735
Okay.

PATIENT X735
I mean I do a rather strenuous kind of weightlifting exercises.

DOCTOR X735
Any worsening of that back pain when you're doing your exercises or not really.

PATIENT X735
It diminishes it.

DOCTOR X735

DOCTOR X735
Right, right, right, yeah.

PATIENT X735

DOCTOR X735
Yeah cause they know how to.

PATIENT X735
And uh, no I had it, he took it but it was still elevated and he said I can't do anything.

DOCTOR X735

The instructor from the Dental Clinic said no you can't do anything as long as there's such an elevated blood pressure.

DOCTOR X735
Right, right.

PATIENT X735

DOCTOR X735
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X735
So anyway.

DOCTOR X735
Or @@@ policy right, yeah.

PATIENT X735
So uh that was how I wound up with.

DOCTOR X735
The diagnosis yeah.  But I mean honestly you look pretty good, you know color @@2.

PATIENT X735

DOCTOR X735
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X735

PATIENT X735
Okay and I don't need anything then I'm all set.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah I'm just gonna take a listen to you and then I might have DOCTOR you know pop her head in to say hi.  Deep breaths and out, again, again, again.  Um this right here, have you had this a while?

PATIENT X735
Yeah this is @@@.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah how long ago was that?

PATIENT X735
Weeks.

DOCTOR X735
Weeks okay.  Anything new of concern?

PATIENT X735
No the only reason, I know how it happens, so all I got to do is take one aspirin.

DOCTOR X735
And you get those yeah.

PATIENT X735
I hit the back of my hand and I have this huge @@@.

DOCTOR X735
And then with the psoriasis, where does it usually affect you?

PATIENT X735
Psoriasis is pretty much gone.  Uh I switched over to a pretty you know, I don't know what, oh I know what I need is the sunscreen.

DOCTOR X735
Sunscreen.

PATIENT X735
Yeah, it's uh the Derm Clinic gave it to me but the sunscreen should be in there.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah I'll check, it might have just fallen off.

PATIENT X735
And uh I could use some of that since I haven't got it.

DOCTOR X735
Let me check your @@@ here.  Any pain when I do that?

PATIENT X735
No.

DOCTOR X735
Good.  I'll go talk to DOCTOR @@@.

PATIENT X735
Yeah, fine, @@@.

DOCTOR X735
I'll be just one second.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  80:44  DOCTOR IN:  88:21)

DOCTOR X735
DOCTOR @@@ um we both think that you know because that level of fasting and because it looked like your cholesterol was under better control with that medication, I would highly recommend restarting it.

PATIENT X735
Oh restart it, @@@.

DOCTOR X735
Um but now if you start noticing muscle aches or anything like that then tell us.

PATIENT X735
I've been taking that @@@.

DOCTOR X735
Okay so you know we'll restart that um and then um do you want to pick it up here or I can have them mail it to you?

PATIENT X735
Yeah they can mail it to me.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah I'll do it.

PATIENT X735
But the um, if you can get the uh.

DOCTOR X735
The sunscreen?

PATIENT X735
Yeah.

DOCTOR X735
Yeah okay, so I'll do that right now.  Okay.

PATIENT X735
If you could just add that, it should be on the Derm.  I went back to the Derm Clinic.

DOCTOR X735
I think it fell off yeah so I can just renew it.  I can have that mailed to you or you can pick it up.

PATIENT X735
Yeah just mail it to me.

DOCTOR X735
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X735
You can do that.

DOCTOR X735
Okay um so basically we think that you know since you're doing really well you know you can come back to see me and DOCTOR in five to six months um but for just like with the cholesterol we're gonna send a letter out to get labs in the next few months basically, six to eight weeks.

PATIENT X735
Okay.

DOCTOR X735
So and then if there's anything off of that then you know we'll contact you and @@@.

PATIENT X735

DOCTOR X735
Um you can just give that to the clerk uh so they'll schedule you.

PATIENT X735
Oh I see.

DOCTOR X735

PATIENT X735
Alright so I give the whole thing to the clerk.

DOCTOR X735

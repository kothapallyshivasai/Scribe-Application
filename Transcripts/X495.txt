DOCTOR X495

PATIENT X495
And I take that you know the prostate thing at night.

DOCTOR X495
Okay.  And that should be about it.

PATIENT X495
Yeah should be about it.  I came in here back in February.  I came to the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X495
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X495
And they did some blood work on me for, for I think checking for something because of the prostate pill that I was taking.

DOCTOR X495
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X495
I been having the.

DOCTOR X495
In January?

PATIENT X495
Yeah I been doing.

DOCTOR X495
Your liver function tests were normal.  Yeah it looks like all they checked was your liver function.

PATIENT X495
I think so.  Yeah and I wanted to see about my blood count.  I haven't had nothing did on that in a while.

DOCTOR X495
Yeah we should check some labs today, check some urine today.

PATIENT X495
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X495
Um and then the thing with the chronic cough like that.

PATIENT X495
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X495
Um have you had a chest x-ray recently?

PATIENT X495
No, except when I had the surgery back in late August.

DOCTOR X495
Okay.

PATIENT X495
I think it was last August I had one.

DOCTOR X495
Um have you ever been exposed to TB, tuberculosis that you know of?  Worked in a hospital or been in jail?

PATIENT X495
Yeah, now a guy that I knew, sometime an old fellow I knew he had it.

DOCTOR X495
Okay.

PATIENT X495
But I came in.

DOCTOR X495
You didn't live with him or anything like that?

PATIENT X495
No, no.

DOCTOR X495
Alright, alright.

PATIENT X495
But I came here right after I'd heard and had a TB test about a year ago.

DOCTOR X495
Yeah I know it doesn't sound like TB.

PATIENT X495
Hmm.

DOCTOR X495
So with a chronic cough the three most common things are could be a little bit of heartburn or reflux can irritate your vocal cords and sometimes you don't even notice it.  You don't even get the heartburn but enough acid gets up there to irritate it.  Um another thing can be the postnasal drip like the back of your sinuses can drip down into the back of your throat.

PATIENT X495
Hmm.

DOCTOR X495
Irritate the vocal cords.  So it sounds like maybe a little bit of each of those could be contributing but also what might be most likely it's this medicine lisinopril.

PATIENT X495
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X495
That's it's most common side effect is a cough and it sounds like the cough started around the same time you started that medication so I think it would be worthwhile to stop the lisinopril, see how you do um.  Your pressure today is pretty good.  Your pressure, you know we may not even need that lisinopril on there cause for the most part.  Like I don't think we need to replace lisinopril with another blood pressure medicine.  I think at this time we could just stop that and continue the water pill.

PATIENT X495
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X495
And if your pressure gets too high then we'll add a blood pressure medicine next time.  Take your shirt off and I'll listen to your lungs.  And you haven't noticed like pain @@@ or weight loss or anything like that have you?

PATIENT X495
No.

DOCTOR X495
Could you take your other shirt off for me please?  Big deep breath.  Take a breath.  Open your mouth, say ah.

PATIENT X495
Ah.

DOCTOR X495
Stick your tongue out a little bit.

PATIENT X495
Ah.

DOCTOR X495
Real wide ah.  Okay relax and then open wide ah.

PATIENT X495
Ah.

DOCTOR X495
Again.  No pain here right?  Yeah I think we'll try first stopping that uh, stopping that medicine, the lisinopril.

PATIENT X495
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X495
And that should take care of your cough.  If that doesn't work I think the next step would be maybe restarting that pill for your stomach because you could be having heartburn that is just enough to get up.  For instance since it's worse in the morning when you lay flat, the stomach contents can kind of travel up your esophagus and then irritate the vocal cords.  It might be enough for you to feel it, feel the burning but it may be enough to cause that cough.

PATIENT X495
Okay.

DOCTOR X495
Well start first with that lisinopril.

PATIENT X495
Okay.  And also I need my refills.

DOCTOR X495
Uh-huh.  I'll refill them.

PATIENT X495
Yeah cause the nurse was checking and she said something about some of them needed to be renewed.

DOCTOR X495
Sure.  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X495
Hmm.

(DOCTOR OUT:  15:35  DOCTOR IN:  18:56)

DOCTOR X495
Alright so um, had a little bit different strategy.  It could be, it could definitely be the lisinopril but because it sounds like it's a little worse in the morning, that kind of leans more toward it being that reflux irritating it.  So I was going to talk it over with DOCTOR first we would try the omeprazole, that pill for your stomach, try it twice in the day and one in the night.  Um the best way to take that is on an empty stomach and then don't eat for about 30-60 minutes because that gives it time to absorb and it decreases the acid production.  Uh take that morning and night.  We're also gonna get a chest x-ray since it's been going on for a year.  Um and then we'll see you back here in about a month um, about four weeks, see if it's better.  If it's better than good, if not then we'll try stopping the lisinopril and switching that to a different medication.

PATIENT X495
Okay.

DOCTOR X495
Because of your diabetes you should be on the medicine either in the class of medicines like lisinopril is in or another class which is very similar, helps protect your kidneys, especially in diabetic patients.  So um sound like a plan?

PATIENT X495
Okay.

DOCTOR X495
Okay.  Uh and then have you get some blood work today too.

PATIENT X495
Okay.

DOCTOR X495
So you can head to the Pharmacy, Radiology and less than a month they'll schedule you your follow-up with me in four weeks.

PATIENT X495
Okay.

DOCTOR X495
Alright.

PATIENT X495
Alright.

DOCTOR X495
And then oh head to the Lab too, cause that's gonna check your diabetes measures and uh some other blood work as well too.

PATIENT X495
Okay.  So I go to the Lab.

DOCTOR X495
Lab, Pharmacy and Radiology.

PATIENT X495
Oh that on the third floor, this floor?

DOCTOR X495
Um actually Outpatient is on this floor, it's all on this floor.

PATIENT X495
The Radiology?

DOCTOR X495
Yeah.

PATIENT X495
Where's that?

DOCTOR X495
It's right next to the Lab.

PATIENT X495
Oh.

DOCTOR X495
You now what I mean, you're looking at the Lab its right there.

PATIENT X495
Oh okay.  Alright.

DOCTOR X495
Alright. 

PATIENT X495
Alright.

DOCTOR X495
I'll see you in about a month.

PATIENT X495
Okay.  So I go to the Pharmacy and then @@@.

DOCTOR X495

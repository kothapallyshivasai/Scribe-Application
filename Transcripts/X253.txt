DOCTOR X253
Okay.

PATIENT X253
And he said that uh probably was the cholesterol medication I was taking.

DOCTOR X253
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X253
He told me to stop taking it.  

DOCTOR X253
Has that stuff gone away sometime?

PATIENT X253
It did slow down a lot.  I mean I get it just not as much as I was getting it before so I thought I was having a heart attack man.

DOCTOR X253
Mainly in the shoulder this time?

PATIENT X253
My shoulder, right shoulder and in the left arm and the right arm, achy all over.  Even in my head with that stuff.

DOCTOR X253
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X253
Yes 80 mg.

DOCTOR X253
Oh so this is completely gone now?

PATIENT X253
Well it comes and goes.  Every now and then it'll come and I get the pain in my shoulders and my arms, you know just like it was before.  Like I said it would take a while before I could actually use it.

DOCTOR X253
That's true.  Um when do you get that pain in your shoulder?

PATIENT X253
Especially at night when I'm laying down.

DOCTOR X253
Do you ever get it when you're walking around?

PATIENT X253
Sometimes.  Very rarely up here though.

DOCTOR X253
Okay.

PATIENT X253
But when I lay down and relax that's when the pain in the shoulders, arms, I get the pain.

DOCTOR X253
Um, do you ever get short of breath with that?

PATIENT X253
Sometimes I get a little bit short of breath just when I walk.

DOCTOR X253
Do you get the shortness of breath at the same time as the shoulder pain or is that separate?

PATIENT X253
It's separate.

DOCTOR X253
Okay.  Uh what about nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT X253
No sir.

DOCTOR X253
Well it doesn't sound like it’s your heart.

PATIENT X253

DOCTOR X253
Alright.

PATIENT X253

DOCTOR X253
You had a and in the past you've had some testing done on your heart.

PATIENT X253

DOCTOR X253
Yeah but even since that time um, it looks like you've had a stress test.

PATIENT X253
A long time before I had the stents.

DOCTOR X253

PATIENT X253
Before I get stents again.

DOCTOR X253
Okay.  When were the stents put in?

PATIENT X253
Pardon?

DOCTOR X253
Can you walk now without getting short of breath?

PATIENT X253
Uh if I walk alone, just walk to fast I'll be short of breath.

DOCTOR X253
Okay.  How long is a long distance?

PATIENT X253
I'd say about one block.

DOCTOR X253
One block?

PATIENT X253
Yes.  I take more steps when I walk fast, try to keep up with my wife you know and then I get tired.

DOCTOR X253
I don't blame you at all okay.  Trying to find when that stress test was that you did.  November.  Alright sir, that's good.  @@@.

PATIENT X253
What's that?

DOCTOR X253
So the stress test that you had was good.

PATIENT X253
It was good but um, but there was this young guy up there.  He suggested that I go downstairs and take that cardiac angiogram.

DOCTOR X253
Angiogram?

PATIENT X253
Angiogram right.  He suggested I do that.  And when I was on the table and he was doing it, then the doctor came in and he told me I two blockages and said he's going to put two stents while I was in there already.

DOCTOR X253
That was done here?

PATIENT X253
Yes, right here.

DOCTOR X253
Trying to figure out when that was done, what month.  Okay February.  

PATIENT X253
Was it in 09, @@@.

DOCTOR X253
No it was in January 2010.

PATIENT X253
January?  No, was it?

DOCTOR X253
Yeah.

PATIENT X253
I didn't think so.

DOCTOR X253
Well let me see, yeah that's when they planned to do it at least.

PATIENT X253
Pardon?

DOCTOR X253
February, February 2010, that was about a year ago.  And you had one vessel that was blocked.

PATIENT X253
There were two blockages.

DOCTOR X253
Yeah, two main ones blocked and what did they do for you, they put some stents in at that time.

PATIENT X253
Yes they did.  Two stents.  And getting up for the bathroom.

DOCTOR X253
But does what you have now, does it feel at all the same as what you had back then?

PATIENT X253
I really think, I didn't feel no different back then cause I didn't know I had a blockage or anything you know.

DOCTOR X253
Okay.

PATIENT X253
I didn't know until they told me.  I was lying there on the table so.  

DOCTOR X253

DOCTOR X253
Well I think we need to um, we need to get them better than that cause I think you're right.  300s, 230, 240s that's too high, we want to get it lower than that.  Now when was your last A1c, let me find out.  Okay so August.

DOCTOR X253
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X253
I feel real jittery you know.

DOCTOR X253
Yeah.  Alright so your hemoglobin A1c, that's the blood test that we use to check how your sugar has been over a three month period.

PATIENT X253
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X253
It's been right around 7, 6.9 to 7.3.  That's pretty good.  We want it to be lower than 7 if we can.  So we’ll try to, we can adjust a little bit your regimen.  Now looks like your cholesterol was also checked back at that time, about a year ago.  We need to check that again.

PATIENT X253
The last my hemoglobin @@@.

DOCTOR X253

PATIENT X253
That was in March, when I came downstairs I think we checked it.

DOCTOR X253

DOCTOR X253
No they didn't actually check that one.  They checked a lot of other good things but not that one.  I'm going to order a few things right now for you.  Um have you ever been on lisinopril?

PATIENT X253
What?

DOCTOR X253
We didn't get through the rest of your list so I need to talk to you about the rest of your medications.  You're on Losartan, metoprolol, a multivitamin.

PATIENT X253
Right.

DOCTOR X253
Omega 3 fatty acids, omeprazole, you were on simvastatin, sildenafil for erectile dysfunction and terazosin for prostate.

PATIENT X253
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X253
@@@ okay.

PATIENT X253

DOCTOR X253
I wish I could.  No I don't think we can today.  So your blood tests from the first of this month look pretty good.

PATIENT X253
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X253
Um your hemoglobin is just a little bit low and that's the blood count, you know the total blood count, it's still a little low.

PATIENT X253

PATIENT X253
Hmm, I don't know cause I had one here didn't I?

DOCTOR X253
Um I don't know I could check for you though.  All your other tests look pretty good so I think really it's the diabetes that we need to work on, just to continue to fine tune that.  I think you're not too far off from where you need to be overall.  Have you seen an eye doctor this year?

PATIENT X253
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X253
So what I'd like you to do, when you come in next time, I want to record for me, in a little book or a binder or piece of paper, right when you wake up in the morning what your sugar is.

PATIENT X253

DOCTOR X253
Perfect and then one time throughout the day, about two hours after you eat.

PATIENT X253
I record it in the morning and record in the week okay.

DOCTOR X253
Okay so this is what I want you to keep doing the morning one.

PATIENT X253
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X253
And then also do it sometime during the day, maybe lunch time or dinner time but two hours after your meal.

PATIENT X253
Okay.

DOCTOR X253
Cause then we can adjust your insulin if we need to.  Uh no medicine changes for now and you have an appointment next month with the cardiologist?

PATIENT X253
Yes, I think it's made for the 15th.

DOCTOR X253
Oh that's good.  I want you to mention the shoulder pain to them.  I don't think it's your heart but you didn't have chest pain before they found this blockage last time, I want to make sure it's not a new blockage.

PATIENT X253
It showed that before.

DOCTOR X253
Right.

PATIENT X253
I don't have chest pain; I don't have no chest pain now.

DOCTOR X253

(DOCTOR OUT:  33:32  DOCTOR IN:  42:16)

DOCTOR X253
Alright, thanks for waiting.  So I think we can make one small adjustment for you.  You're taking 36 units of insulin twice a day?

PATIENT X253
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X253
I want to go up on the morning dose okay so to about 38, it's a small increase.  You'll go from 36 to 38 in the morning.

PATIENT X253
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X253
Keep it at 36 in the evening and do like I told you which is check your blood sugar in the morning and then in the evening and we'll see how they go.  Everything else we'll just do the same for now and then we'll see you back in about 6-8 weeks.

PATIENT X253
Don't take the cholesterol medicines, should I stay off it?

DOCTOR X253
Oh you know what, you're right.  I wanted to talk to you about that too.  I think its okay to restart that but I want to start it at a lower dose.  You're taking the highest dose that's available right now.  I'm going to change that so that it's a low dose.

PATIENT X253

DOCTOR X253

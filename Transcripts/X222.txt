DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
I'm his life partner.  Nice to meet you.

DOCTOR X222
Hi, alright so I was pretty sure it was you but I think it's always a good idea when people bring other people with them to appointments.

SECOND PERSON X222
I just don't let him go anywhere by himself.

DOCTOR X222
That way she can tattle on you.

SECOND PERSON X222
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X222
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X222
No this way he can't lie to me.

DOCTOR X222
So let's see.  How have you been doing?

PATIENT X222
Oh fairly well I think.

DOCTOR X222
Did you tell the hospital, not still.

PATIENT X222
For 12 hours yeah.

DOCTOR X222
For 12 hours.  Was it a good stay for 12 hours?

PATIENT X222
Not really.

DOCTOR X222
What'd they do?

PATIENT X222
Nothing.
 
DOCTOR X222
Nothing?  Alright.

SECOND PERSON X222
They've been working on his lungs now.  I guess they're thoracic or whatever was talking about um.

PATIENT X222
They found a little spot on my lungs.

DOCTOR X222

PATIENT X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222

PATIENT X222
In my lungs yeah.

SECOND PERSON X222
In the lungs correct.

DOCTOR X222
And have you seen um, oh okay you just found out.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah cause today he's got an appointment for um.

DOCTOR X222

SECOND PERSON X222
For EKG and then Cardiology.

PATIENT X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
To get the whatever.

DOCTOR X222
And what are they planning on doing?

PATIENT X222
Well they want to go in on the new module.

SECOND PERSON X222
Nodule.

PATIENT X222
That they found, they want to go in and take a biopsy of it I guess.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.  So @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X222
Yes I may lose @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
One, two day procedure could be a five to seven day depending on what gets found out and stuff.
 
DOCTOR X222
Oh you mean how long he's going to be in the hospital and what not.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.  I have a question so when he was in, about two weeks ago he came in for a um Urology consult.

DOCTOR X222
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X222
And they were going to take; well they did take a sample of the urine and everything.  Did anything come back with that, I mean anything abnormal or?

PATIENT X222
Well they were supposed to send it off because it came through the @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right I know that's why I'm wondering if they found anything.

DOCTOR X222
Well I don't see any urine in here.  I don't see it.  Let me read their notes.  Cause you just saw them on the 10th.

SECOND PERSON X222
Correct.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Don't do that @@@.

DOCTOR X222
This is not good for me.  Um oh okay, so they did a cystoscopy it looks like.  That's how @@@ Cytology so I'll check that.  There we go.  So it says um there are some cell abnormalities um and rare atypical cells and some regular just plain cells suggestive of a particular virus.  It doesn't say anything specifically about any sort of cancer.

SECOND PERSON X222
Hmm.

DOCTOR X222
I don't think it's a completely normal result.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.


DOCTOR X222
But I'm not a urologist, I don't know exactly.

SECOND PERSON X222
Well I know they've got a follow-up, I think it's March 5th or something for him to go back again so.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
I was just wondering you know what they'd found or.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah definitely they did not see any positive for malignancy there so.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
What other questions?

PATIENT X222
Huh question.

DOCTOR X222
You can put that on the table if you want to @@@.  So uh you have Cardiology @@@ today.

SECOND PERSON X222
Hmm.

DOCTOR X222
When are your tests going to be?

PATIENT X222
I have no idea.
 
DOCTOR X222
You haven't had it scheduled yet?

PATIENT X222
No.

SECOND PERSON X222
They're waiting until all the @@@ on this.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

PATIENT X222
Just out of curiosity um I had a form and somebody sent a form in for diabetic shoes but somebody said that I haven't been in here for two years and I have to come in you know before they can sign it.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

PATIENT X222
And I was seen every three months ago.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

PATIENT X222
Somebody said that I haven't been here in two years and I just kind of wonder where they got that information now.
 
DOCTOR X222
You know what I think it is is that you haven't been to see a primary care doctor in quite some time.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.

PATIENT X222
I don't think I've ever seen a primary care doctor that I know of.

DOCTOR X222
Well.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@ DOCTOR either moved on or.

PATIENT X222
Oh I'm not sure they were primary doctors.

DOCTOR X222
The last time I saw you was in June.  You were supposed to @@@ DOCTOR but I believe that I have seen you once before because you were, yeah cause I covered her clinics when she was on maternity leave.  Since I have, at this point, seen you twice and she had never seen you, I just kind of put you in my clinic cause there really was no point in establishing care again @@@.  Especially since @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.

DOCTOR X222
No one is seeing you, but you know by now it's been a year since.  So that's @@@.  Um so they said that you had to come in and be seen for that to go forward right?

PATIENT X222
Yeah um.
 
DOCTOR X222
@@@.  I think they wanted you to see me just because someone didn't have you in @@@ is that right?

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

PATIENT X222
Nobody has seen me huh?

DOCTOR X222
No they didn't.

SECOND PERSON X222
I was here.

PATIENT X222
You have to.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Cause it's just never been one particular.

DOCTOR X222
Right, no that's fine.

SECOND PERSON X222
Like you know if we had a question or something there's never been anybody who we could really call because they say well who's your doctor and it's like okay we don't know.

PATIENT X222
What time of a day is yeah.

DOCTOR X222
So we can go ahead with that.  You know, I couldn't find where they have this @@@ they sent you to doctor.  @@@.  Do you have that paperwork with you on the shoes?

PATIENT X222
What paperwork do you need?

DOCTOR X222
For the diabetic shoes.

SECOND PERSON X222
No.

PATIENT X222
No.

SECOND PERSON X222
That's one piece of paper I didn't bring with.

PATIENT X222
Well that's got nothing to do with the VA though that's medical.

DOCTOR X222
Let me see if at home I have it in my files because when you had the first visit and then you haven't seen somebody in a while they probably wanted him checked.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah for the neuropathy and all that.
 
DOCTOR X222
So, now what do you need, do you need to get a prescription?

PATIENT X222
Uh, I guess we need permission to get the shoes uh.

SECOND PERSON X222
But what do you @@@.

PATIENT X222
I got some medical supplier @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Oh for your medical supplier?

DOCTOR X222
Okay so you need @@@.

PATIENT X222
It's got nothing to do with you know the VA.

DOCTOR X222
The VA okay.

PATIENT X222
But they asked who the primary doctor I saw and that's where they got the VA.

DOCTOR X222
And they asked where your primary doctor was okay.

PATIENT X222
Yeah.
 
DOCTOR X222
So let me look through this um and I can reach you at PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT X222
Most of the time.

DOCTOR X222
Okay even if you just have a number for the supplier, I could maybe just call them and have them fax it to me.

SECOND PERSON X222
I think we've got it at home, that I do know.

PATIENT X222
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X222
The regular number.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

PATIENT X222
Yeah cause I think I told you @@@.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah.

PATIENT X222
Alright.
 
DOCTOR X222
Um okay so we want in to @@@ having this weight loss and I think we need to kind of get him then followed um.

PATIENT X222
Yeah.

DOCTOR X222
You’ve @@@ some weight it looks like @@@.

PATIENT X222
No I don't think so.

DOCTOR X222
Oh.

PATIENT X222
Yeah I go by weight at home without you know clothes or anything like that, that adds about 15 pounds.

DOCTOR X222
So this is your weight trend over the last two years.  So you were about 158 in February 2009 then it went down and then it came back up and then @@@ in the study and he is actually up to about 150 now.  That's you know with our scale.

PATIENT X222
Well @@@ weighed me in so many clothes.
 
DOCTOR X222
Yeah and you should be in theory fully-clothed every time you take your weight here so.

PATIENT X222
Okay but that's you know.

DOCTOR X222
We're going to follow your trends here.  I'm not saying that that's not concerning.  I think if you continue losing weight and um and with the lung nodules we should follow up on this @@@.

PATIENT X222
Well we saw the nutritionist @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
And anyhow she gave us all sorts of ideas for.

DOCTOR X222
Good.

SECOND PERSON X222
You know shakes and smoothies and things that you know.

DOCTOR X222
To gain weight.

SECOND PERSON X222
And things that you know.  Like anything, she said the thing is you know you can have anything in front of you but if you are not hungry, you can't force yourself to eat, I don't care you know, I wish that was my problem but it's not.

DOCTOR X222
Me too.

SECOND PERSON X222
But um you know and I mean she gave us some really good ideas and you know peanut butter and graham crackers and you know on the one hand the things could definitely put the weight on him but then on the other hand.

PATIENT X222
Being diabetic it's kind of hard.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah you know so it's, it is hard to balance it out.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
Kind of like I said its one thing @@@ but he just has I mean no appetite.

PATIENT X222
I don't think there's a magic pill to cure that.

SECOND PERSON X222
And maybe there's not, I have to tell people that.  Because when I say he has no appetite they look at me like.

DOCTOR X222
Are you serious?

SECOND PERSON X222
Yes I am.

PATIENT X222
Try Mcxxx’s, yeah.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.  I don't expect him to be the @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Thank you.

DOCTOR X222
So um.

SECOND PERSON X222
We have a 7 pound xxx terrier, Yorkie at home that I swear eats more than he does.  Right?

PATIENT X222
Yeah.  Yes he does.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah.  I have a little yippy dog, kind of a 7 pound um Maltese.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay I know what they look like.

DOCTOR X222
Pretty little @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah but you know you can't live with them but you can't live without them either.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X222
Well what if you try, see for a change.
 
DOCTOR X222
I know @@@.  Alright so um are you having any chest pain with walking around?

PATIENT X222
No.

DOCTOR X222
About how far do you think you can walk?

PATIENT X222
Oh eight or nine steps most of the time uh I have no qualms about.  I haven't taking 20 mile hikes or anything you know but I'm.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
He gets lightheaded and dizzy if he gets up real fast um.  @@@ when it was up here @@@ or whatever.  It's still there, I can tell just by you know him putting his hand up there or whatever the case may be but um, to walk for any great length or anything like that uh uh.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
So @@@ stuff like that.

DOCTOR X222
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X222
The pain?

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@.

DOCTOR X222
Not being able to walk, seven steps is not very far.

PATIENT X222
No I was joking.

DOCTOR X222
You can walk here from the parking lot is that correct?

PATIENT X222
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh you know I think the combination also is part of the diabetes because of the numbness.

DOCTOR X222
And tingling in the feet?

SECOND PERSON X222
And tingling in the feet and legs yeah.
 
DOCTOR X222
@@@.

PATIENT X222
Oh I had, they cut the toenail off at that time.

SECOND PERSON X222
That was last year.

PATIENT X222
I dropped something two years.

SECOND PERSON X222
A year ago.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.  So we need to get you back in the Podiatry Clinic.  Well maybe that can wait until after you're meeting with the lung doctors okay but I don't want to @@@ making sure you're doing for your diabetes um just because of that.  Um so I think the best thing to do is either, cause your hemoglobin A1c was 8.8 @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Is that good, bad or indifferent?

DOCTOR X222
It's not good.

PATIENT X222
@@@.

DOCTOR X222
No it needs to be higher than that, I mean lower.

PATIENT X222
Lower, thank you.
 
DOCTOR X222
Um but your blood sugars look okay, they're not terrible.

SECOND PERSON X222
No but I have a question for you on that one.

DOCTOR X222
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X222
You know I @@@ on the one hand with the eating and so on and forth okay and like the nutritionist was saying that you know yes we know diabetes is the concern but you know you also need to you know eat to keep your energy up and so on and so forth but his blood sugar lately cause he takes it every day okay.
DOCTOR X222
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X222
He takes it in the morning and everything, it can range anywhere from let's say one day well you know 135-140 and it can go up @@@.

DOCTOR X222
What's it in the morning?

SECOND PERSON X222
He only takes it once a day and it's in the morning.

DOCTOR X222
Okay and it varies that much huh?

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah.

PATIENT X222
Uh it depends you know if I have a late night snack you know before I go to bed it's going to be higher the next morning.

DOCTOR X222
What's your dose of Glargine at night?

PATIENT X222
30, 30 units.  So I think I got 28 but one doctor told me to go up to 30.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

PATIENT X222
That's what I've been taking.

DOCTOR X222
When did you go up to 30?

PATIENT X222
Oh about uh three months ago maybe.
 
DOCTOR X222
Do you take anything else or do you just take that one medicine?

PATIENT X222
Just one time a day.

DOCTOR X222
So I think we need to get you in to see the @@@ to help manage your blood sugars because managing your blood sugars before you get the surgery is going to be important okay.

PATIENT X222
Uh I am wondering if I should go back to the, I'm on the slow-acting once a day insulin.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah.

PATIENT X222
So you can't really change it during the day.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
What's the problem?

DOCTOR X222
Lispro it's a short-acting insulin and that's usually what we do is recommend a long-acting as kind of a baseline.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
And then the short-acting to be used with meals.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

PATIENT X222
Well I was led to believe that you couldn't mix the two.

DOCTOR X222
No you can.  Yeah there are two different types.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@ cause I know sometimes it does depend on if he ate late you know the evening before or if he gets up in the morning and has a cookie or something.

DOCTOR X222
Do you ever feel a little shaky at night or shaky with low blood sugar?

PATIENT X222
I have once or twice, twice but I try to alleviate that by I guess cause one time I passed out.

DOCTOR X222
Are you having any chest pain?

PATIENT X222
No.
 
DOCTOR X222
@@@.  We probably should repeat your hemoglobin A1c today just to see what it is um but most of your labs are really quite normal and then the only other thing is that I want to check um.

SECOND PERSON X222
Do they have lab draws for brain function?

DOCTOR X222
We don't.

PATIENT X222
@@@.

DOCTOR X222
Probably trials.

SECOND PERSON X222
I had to throw that in there sorry.

PATIENT X222
After that behave.

DOCTOR X222
Now have you eaten this morning?

PATIENT X222
No.

DOCTOR X222
No.

PATIENT X222
No.

SECOND PERSON X222
Cup of coffee.
 
DOCTOR X222
Alright then.

PATIENT X222
At 6:30 in the morning I'm not hungry.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.  And then how has your blood pressure been?

PATIENT X222
Uh not bad.

DOCTOR X222
Okay so you're taking a baby aspirin, the gabapentin, the insulin and everything we said.

PATIENT X222
Uh I just started taking aspirin again.

DOCTOR X222
Well they may tell you to stop that for the surgery.  Lisinopril 40 daily right?

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
Simvastatin okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
My voice is going out on me.  Simvastatin is that a derivative of Lipitor or?

DOCTOR X222
Yeah it's a similar drug.

SECOND PERSON X222
Is it?  Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Same kind.  Alright so I think we need some labs today just to check your lipids.

PATIENT X222
As long it don't involve needles with that.

DOCTOR X222
There's no way to give blood without a needle.

PATIENT X222
Bite my lip.

DOCTOR X222
@@@ that might take longer @@@.  Um I know and then I wonder if we need to have you do some more diabetes education.  Do you know that you should be checking your blood sugars more often?

PATIENT X222
Well I was lead to believe that @@@ that I've been using for about a year now.
 
DOCTOR X222
Yeah.

PATIENT X222
But there's not, again I was under the impression you couldn't take any @@@.

DOCTOR X222
Right but you can check it different times and you can add @@@ to your meal.  It sounds like you probably could go up on the Glargine even more.  So let's see what your hemoglobin A1c shows since it's been a while since you've had that.

PATIENT X222
Yeah, it's supposed to be what around 4 or 5.

DOCTOR X222
Your hemoglobin A1c?

PATIENT X222
Yeah.

DOCTOR X222
Between 6 and 7.

PATIENT X222
Oh I thought it was.
 
DOCTOR X222
Your hemoglobin A1c it's not terrible but it's not good.  So that could be better and the reason I'm thinking about doing it now is because I want it to be as good as possible prior to your surgery.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.

DOCTOR X222
Because how well your diabetes is controlled with @@@ on how long you heal.  You know a diabetic sort has a hard time healing from surgery.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.

PATIENT X222
So yeah.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah.

PATIENT X222
And they know that I'm allergic to needles.

DOCTOR X222
Um @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Well we only @@@.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah.

PATIENT X222
@@@.  I think you missed that.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@.  I'm going to give that to you but that's not @@@.

DOCTOR X222
@@@.

PATIENT X222
We're not going back there now.

SECOND PERSON X222
Oh I'm sorry.
 
DOCTOR X222
Take a deep breath in and out.  Breathe normal.  Where is your pain?

PATIENT X222
Uh if I have it's right underneath the ribs.

DOCTOR X222
Is it reproducible when you push there?

PATIENT X222
No.

DOCTOR X222
No it's inside.

PATIENT X222
Yeah.

DOCTOR X222
No you feel that it's inside, it doesn't hurt when I push or anything?

PATIENT X222
No, no.
 
DOCTOR X222
Okay.  Alright.  Well its sounding like I do think that we need to be managed right now is, I would probably recommend that we get a @@@ to help manage and take care of your meds.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
Because once we are able to get the under control then we can kind of continue you know care.  But @@@ kind of @@@.

PATIENT X222
She used to call about once a month and I haven't heard from her.

DOCTOR X222
You used to follow up with the diabetes?

SECOND PERSON X222
Yes they'd call him.

PATIENT X222
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@.  And that was more kind of how you doing um.

PATIENT X222
Yeah I got @@@ up in the ankle but I haven't heard from her @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
No it was a long time ago.

DOCTOR X222
Now I don't see you for the visits, not even phone.

PATIENT X222
Yeah she used to call um I would say every six weeks or so.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@ three, four times @@@.

PATIENT X222
Quite a while since she's called.  I had forgotten all about that.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah once she said @@@.  

DOCTOR X222
Yeah.  Okay, a consult was put in in 2008.  Why don't you @@@ cause I don't know if you need a new consult.  Do you know their phone number?

SECOND PERSON X222
The @@@?

DOCTOR X222
Yeah the pharmacist?

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
Why don't you go ahead and give them a call.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
And get @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
8.8 really isn't good enough.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
You know.

SECOND PERSON X222
And that's something you don't @@@.

DOCTOR X222
Um the, it's called the hemoglobin A1c is what we follow and it's basically like a report card of your blood sugar control for the last three months.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@.

DOCTOR X222
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X222
And that's what we want to tell her when we call.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah.  I mean we're going to repeat it today and I'll titrate it up but I think it's going to be especially important because he's going to have surgery.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Just have her.

SECOND PERSON X222
Hemoglobin A, what is it.

PATIENT X222
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Hemoglobin A.

DOCTOR X222
A1c.

SECOND PERSON X222

DOCTOR X222

SECOND PERSON X222

DOCTOR X222
Yeah I wish I could, that would be nice.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@ nice.

DOCTOR X222
I'll be right back okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
You know let me look at their last note cause I don't know.  I don't want to get so caught up in not being your health maintenance doctor because of the more active issues.  Yeah we're going to do um, uh let's see.  You had a colonoscopy in 2009 which was fine.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh yes.

DOCTOR X222
You had the pneumo vaccination in 2003, tetanus done in 2002  and then um and have you ever smoked?

PATIENT X222
Oh 12 or 13 years ago.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.  So you had a CT scan and that would have told us @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
Okay so no aneurysms, so pretty much your screening is up-to-date alright.

PATIENT X222
You don't @@@ that do you?

DOCTOR X222
No.  You're in the hospital system, there's nothing we can do about it.

SECOND PERSON X222
You can run but you can't hide.

DOCTOR X222
Sorry.

SECOND PERSON X222
No I'm glad you @@@.

(DOCTOR OUT:  92:45  DOCTOR IN:  102:20)

DOCTOR X222
Where'd your wife go?  She leave you?

PATIENT X222
No, somebody @@@.

DOCTOR X222
Alright.

PATIENT X222

DOCTOR X222
Um okay, so I'm going to put in for another Pharm D consult just to see, just in case you need a new one.

PATIENT X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Um @@@.  When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

PATIENT X222
Uh yeah I see him again February 3rd I think.

DOCTOR X222
Okay so you need to see Ophtho um, Podiatry you need to make a call to them okay and then you should probably call and make another appointment with the Hemoc Clinic too.  

PATIENT X222
And what's that about?

DOCTOR X222
The Cancer Clinic, just because of the lung nodules, I think you have.

PATIENT X222
Yeah that was the whole reason.  There was one before when I had the original cancer 12 years ago.
 
DOCTOR X222
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X222
But now another one's developed and that's the one they wanted to test to see if it is cancer.

DOCTOR X222
Yeah I just think that you probably should you know.

PATIENT X222
Well I just can't see being in the hospital for five days for that but.

DOCTOR X222
Oh no seen in the clinic.

PATIENT X222
Oh.

DOCTOR X222
Just make an appointment.  You get your meds mailed to you right?

PATIENT X222
Yeah.
 
DOCTOR X222
Okay.  So I'm going to change your Glargine to 32 units okay.

PATIENT X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Um let's see what else do we need to refill for you?

PATIENT X222
Um I don't know.  Unfortunately I've gotten lazy and the wife takes care of that.

DOCTOR X222
I'll just look.  I just don't want things to expire on you, you know.  Are you still taking the terazosin?  Come in.

SECOND PERSON X222
It's just me.

DOCTOR X222
Are you still taking your terazosin?

PATIENT X222
Am I taking whatever she said?

DOCTOR X222
Um you know what I'll just get a refill for you.  Simvastatin, @@@.  So I won't worry about that.  Do you take a docusate every day the stool softener?

PATIENT X222
Yeah @@@.
 
DOCTOR X222
@@@.

PATIENT X222
I don't think I'm taking anything @@@.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

PATIENT X222
@@@.

DOCTOR X222
Um you do need to get labs done, if you have time to get them done before your appointment.

SECOND PERSON X222
When does it open the Lab?

PATIENT X222
The Lab?

DOCTOR X222
Um you could go down on the first floor and see if they're still around up here.  I think they head out a little bit earlier because it's uh.

PATIENT X222
Lunchtime.
 
DOCTOR X222
Yeah and then yeah how's your peripheral neuropathy?

SECOND PERSON X222
Lousy.

PATIENT X222
Yeah.

DOCTOR X222
@@@ gabapentin, you're not on @@@ so do you want to try that?

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah.

DOCTOR X222
You can answer for him, that's fine.

SECOND PERSON X222
He looked at you like neuropathy, what is that?

DOCTOR X222
No yeah @@@.

PATIENT X222
I don't mind it in the feet and legs, it bothers the hands you know and knowing @@@ negative.

DOCTOR X222
You know how you're taking the 300 tablets?

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
I changed it to three every eight hours instead of two every eight hours.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
So it should come to you in the mail but the stuff you have at home you can do that.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay so three instead of two okay.

DOCTOR X222
Three yes.  So the maximum dose is actually four.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Every three hours or every eight hours now sometimes when you go up it can make you feel a little bit more like I don't know tired.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Things like that.

PATIENT X222
That's what I need.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah.

DOCTOR X222
So just watch it um.  That's why I'm not going up to 1200 three times a day, just going up by one.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
And if this isn't helping we'll try going up by more.  Your kidney function is normal.

SECOND PERSON X222
Right.

DOCTOR X222
So there's no reason why you can't.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Go to four.

PATIENT X222
Okay.
 
DOCTOR X222
Alright.  So Glargine up to 32 units.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Gabapentin up to three pills two times a day.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
And I put in the Pharm D consult again.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
Just in case um.  You should follow up with Oncology at some point just you know.  I know you already know them through DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X222
Yeah.

DOCTOR X222
But um I think you might get a different oncologist because you DOCTOR at all?

SECOND PERSON X222
She's from the.

DOCTOR X222
She's one of the main lung doctors here.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
The lung cancer doctors.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
And this is all depending what their.

SECOND PERSON X222
Sure.

DOCTOR X222
But you she'll want you to still get something with them.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay.

DOCTOR X222
And then follow up with Podiatry okay?

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X222
Cause you mentioned a supplemental insulin that I could take.

DOCTOR X222
I think we can start with the Glargine first.

PATIENT X222
Go up to 32?
 
DOCTOR X222
You know since your morning sugars are good and then if we need to then we can add on the other one.  So.

SECOND PERSON X222
So go up to 32 on the insulin.

DOCTOR X222
Let's assume the control there and then if you start having, but that means to start checking your blood sugars more times during the day, at least one other time, to kind of get an idea of where your sugars are going during the day to see if you need that extra insulin okay.

PATIENT X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
Cause I don't know if you need it.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@.

DOCTOR X222
So I think we could just get it under control with the Glargine.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
But if we can't then we can always add it on.

PATIENT X222
If she'd take all the cakes and pies out of the house I wouldn't need it.

DOCTOR X222
But it doesn't sound like a very fun house okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
No none.

DOCTOR X222
Um and is there a reason why you're not on a beta blocker that you know of?  By that I mean anything like metoprolol, carvedilol.

PATIENT X222
I was.

SECOND PERSON X222
He was on the metoprolol, yeah that one.

DOCTOR X222
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X222
He was on it once and then they didn't refill it or took him off, I don't remember what it was.

DOCTOR X222
They may want to restart that but I'll let Cardiology discuss that with you because it can be cardio protective to the heart.

SECOND PERSON X222
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X222
It's um prior to surgery post and prior.

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay. 

DOCTOR X222
So they may decide to give you that and your heart rate will tolerate it so I don't see any reason not to.  Otherwise you're on everything else that you should be on okay.

PATIENT X222
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X222
Any questions?

PATIENT X222
We want to get out of here, yeah no.
 
DOCTOR X222
Antsy, antsy, antsy.  Let me look across @@@.

SECOND PERSON X222
@@@.

PATIENT X222

DOCTOR X222

SECOND PERSON X222

DOCTOR X222
Yeah. So you need to go downstairs, on the first floor.

SECOND PERSON X222
You really want us to do those today?

PATIENT X222

DOCTOR X222
Yeah, especially with it that elevated yeah.

SECOND PERSON X222

DOCTOR X222

SECOND PERSON X222

SECOND PERSON X222
Okay and then I'll look for it.

PATIENT X222

DOCTOR X222

PATIENT X222

DOCTOR X222
Okay, alright.

SECOND PERSON X222

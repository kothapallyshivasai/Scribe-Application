Next one is April 12th.

DOCTOR X595
Okay.  Cause I can fill some of this out but the reason for your disability is schizophrenia right, so I can't really describe you know how it interferes with your work.  I'll talk the DOCTOR to see if there's something else we can do but maybe your psychiatrist would be better filling out some of this stuff.  

PATIENT X595

DOCTOR X595
Let me take a listen to you.  Deep breath.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT X595
Yep.

DOCTOR X595
How much?

PATIENT X595
About a pack a day.

DOCTOR X595
Pack a day.  Any thoughts of quitting?

PATIENT X595
No.

DOCTOR X595
Why not?

PATIENT X595
I kind of like smoking.

DOCTOR X595
You know it's harmful for you right?

PATIENT X595
Well I believe it's harmful for some and not harmful to others.

DOCTOR X595
It's harmful to everybody.

PATIENT X595
Oh.

DOCTOR X595
It'll, you don't feel anything and then all of a sudden it's, it gets to the point where your lungs are too affected and you can't get in any oxygen.  People end up on oxygen at home, end up on breathing machines because they can't breathe cause their lungs don't function as well.  It causes a lot of problems.  It causes heart problems.  People that smoke tend to have heart attacks a lot earlier than people that don't smoke um so and it is a lot of money, it's getting more expensive so.  That's what I want you to do for the next time I see you.  I want you to think about quitting.

PATIENT X595
Or I'll cut back quite a bit maybe.

DOCTOR X595
Okay.  I mean I can't say no to that but my goal is to get you to quit okay.

DOCTOR X679
PATIENT?

PATIENT X679
Right here.  So how you doing?

DOCTOR X679
Doing well.

PATIENT X679
Thank you.  Appreciate it.

DOCTOR X679
I am doing well.  @@@.

PATIENT X679
@@@.  

DOCTOR X679
I am taking over for DOCTOR.  I know you saw in the past.

PATIENT X679
Okay.

DOCTOR X679
@@@.

PATIENT X679
Okay.

DOCTOR X679
So what brings you here today?

PATIENT X679
Huh?

DOCTOR X679
What brings you here today?

PATIENT X679
Oh yes, I need an appointment to see a foot doctor and uh, let me see if I can get @@@.

DOCTOR X679
Okay.

PATIENT X679
And I was scheduled for @@@ but when I didn’t @@@, uh, @@@ when you get up to 50 years old?

DOCTOR X679
Colonoscopy?

PATIENT X679
Colonoscopy, yea.  @@@.  Yea, colonoscopy.  I think I had one before.

DOCTOR X679
Okay.

PATIENT X679
But I think I need another one.

DOCTOR X679
They said one in 2007.  That was the last time.  Let’s see what they said.

PATIENT X679
Okay.

DOCTOR X679
In 2007 they found that everything looks normal.  @@@.  There were diverticula which are like outpouches in the wall of the colon.  Um, everything was normal.  They did take biopsies.  Let me look at the results.  Um, let’s see what else they did.  Upper GI.  So, @@@.  You had a catheterization done @@@.

PATIENT X679
Um hmm.

DOCTOR X679
And were you @@@.  Is your diarrhea better?

PATIENT X679
It is about the same.

DOCTOR X679
About the same, okay.  So the biopsies were actually normal.  Okay.  So there were @@@ and then what did they say about the biopsies.  So with the chronic @@@, diarrhea, work up was negative.  Stool cards were negative.  So they said followup in GI Clinic.  Are you losing weight?

PATIENT X679
Ah no.

DOCTOR X679
Okay.

PATIENT X679
I have gained weight in fact.  @@@.  

DOCTOR X679
Okay.  Good.  Um, so it looks like all the stool studies were negative.  So what did they decide to do?  Did they say?

PATIENT X679
No, they didn’t say.

DOCTOR X679
Okay.  So I don’t think we need to repeat colonoscopy.  You had it in 2007.  So you really don’t need one for another couple of years.

PATIENT X679
Okay, so you have it every seven years or something like that?

DOCTOR X679
You have it every ten years @@@ earlier.  If you have like abnormalities, you know maybe if you have like polyps, you have abnormal pathology then they would want to see you sooner.

PATIENT X679
Okay.

DOCTOR X679
But from the way it looks like they made comments that they want to see you @@@ sooner.  Let me see if in the notes if they actually want to @@@.  Any other questions?

PATIENT X679
Uh no.  @@@ about colonoscopy?  @@@.  Should I have another one?

DOCTOR X679
When should you have another one?  Since everything looked okay I think, the biopsies were normal, I think you probably should have one about 2017.  

PATIENT X679
17?  That long?

DOCTOR X679
Um hm.

PATIENT X679
Okay.  Alright.  That is better than @@@ back in 2008 or 2007.

DOCTOR X679
For your foot?

PATIENT X679
Uh huh.

DOCTOR X679
What was wrong with the foot?

PATIENT X679
They said they might have to operate on my right foot, @@@, and I never came back, @@@ has stairs so I never @@@.

DOCTOR X679
Okay.  So let’s see.  You had an appointment back in 2007.  Let’s see.  Oh I see you had the bony, the @@@.

PATIENT X679
The @@@.

DOCTOR X679
From the joints, right.  Like a little bony @@@.

PATIENT X679
Right.

DOCTOR X679
Okay.  And they did they want to do something about it?

PATIENT X679
They wanted to, @@@, they told me I couldn’t climb the stairs, no, after the operation.  So I said I can’t do that so @@@.  It starts back hurting worse so that is why I asked you about it.

DOCTOR X679
Okay.  Alright.  Yea then we can definitely send you back to the clinic.  Let me put in another request.

PATIENT X679

DOCTOR X145 
PATIENT?

PATIENT X145
Yes sir.  

DOCTOR X145
How you doing today sir?

PATIENT X145
Alright.

DOCTOR X145
You can come back here.  Good to see you, how have you been doing?

PATIENT X145
Uh I been okay I guess.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.

PATIENT X145
Yep.

DOCTOR X145
Good uh.

PATIENT X145
Can't really complain.

DOCTOR X145
That is good to hear.  I see your blood pressure's a little bit high today though.

PATIENT X145
Well I just came straight from Physical Therapy.

DOCTOR X145
I saw that, I saw that, yeah.

PATIENT X145
So that was probably it.

DOCTOR X145
Physical Therapy was for your back huh?

PATIENT X145
Yeah for the lower back.

DOCTOR X145
How's that been doing?

PATIENT X145
I don't know it's really changed that much yet it's.

DOCTOR X145
Has it gotten any better?

PATIENT X145
Maybe just a little bit but not a whole lot so.

DOCTOR X145
So remind me, what happened to your back?

PATIENT X145
Uh.

DOCTOR X145
I was going to say, I don't think I remember that.

PATIENT X145
No you didn't, the arthritis doctor did I think.

DOCTOR X145
Oh gotcha.

PATIENT X145
Because they were saying that I got arthritis in the back and the shoulders and the knees.

DOCTOR X145
@@@.  I gotcha.

PATIENT X145
Uh before I forget it, all of your prescriptions DOCTOR you need to renew the prescriptions.

DOCTOR X145
I will take care of that today.  Yep that's not a problem.  I'm just uh taking a second to catch up on what you've been doing.  There are a lot of Rehabilitation Notes in here.  You've been to the MOVE Program.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
It's going down that's good.  But that what it was when I saw you.  Following up with Anticoagulation.  How about the liver, have you seen the liver guys?

PATIENT X145
Yeah uh, they told me I got the hepatitis C.

DOCTOR X145
Uh-huh.  Okay. 

PATIENT X145
But they said, the way I understand it it's in the mid stages.

DOCTOR X145
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X145
So I don't really need any treatment at this point, just try to keep everything.

DOCTOR X145
Just keep following with them yeah.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
And we're not drinking anymore right?

PATIENT X145
No I haven't had a beer in almost a year so, any kind of alcohol that I know of intentionally so.

DOCTOR X145
Gotcha.  

PATIENT X145
Maybe that's why I've dropped about 27 or 28 pounds.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah and that'll help your blood pressure too uh.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Seen here for follow-up.  Have you been trying to lose weight?

PATIENT X145
Not really no, I just.  When I'm hungry I eat and when I'm not hungry I don't eat which.

DOCTOR X145
Gotcha.

PATIENT X145
It seems like I used to get a craving for something and couldn't figure out what I was craving so I'd nibble everything and never find it but I haven't been getting that craving so I guess.

DOCTOR X145
You may just be eating less.

PATIENT X145
That's the only thing I can think of.

DOCTOR X145
Uh-huh.  Okay good.  So looks like you've been doing pretty good.  How's your diabetes been doing?

PATIENT X145
Diabetes?

DOCTOR X145
How's your sugars?  Have you been eating okay?

PATIENT X145
I guess so, I didn't know.

DOCTOR X145
Well we started you on metformin I believe.  A medicine to control your sugars.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Have you been taking that?

PATIENT X145
I.

DOCTOR X145
Let's run through your medicines and figure out what you're taking and what you're not, how about that?

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
Um so there's a couple of creams here, you finished it now.  The Coumadin you still take right?

PATIENT X145
Right.

DOCTOR X145
It looks like that needs a refill.

PATIENT X145
Yeah it does.

DOCTOR X145
Just in the mail?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
And you follow at the Coumadin Clinic?

PATIENT X145
Yeah I follow up with that.

DOCTOR X145
Alright.  The stomach medicine?

PATIENT X145
The what?

DOCTOR X145
There's a stomach medicine omeprazole.

PATIENT X145
Oh that's that little capsule for the.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah.

PATIENT X145
For the.

DOCTOR X145
Acid reflux?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah and you take that right?

PATIENT X145
I'm still taking that yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Valsartan, that's a medicine for uh blood pressure.

PATIENT X145
Okay the little white pill?

DOCTOR X145
I don't know the color of it.  You take the blood pressure pill Valsartan?

PATIENT X145
There's two or three, three I can't remember which ones.  There's three of them.

DOCTOR X145
Uh how about tramadol?  That was one of the pain pills.

PATIENT X145
Yeah that was the, the arthritis doctor gave me that.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.  Digoxin?

PATIENT X145
Digoxin yeah I got that.  It's the third blood pressure pill.

DOCTOR X145
It helps with your atrial fibrillation.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
For rate control.  Um metoprolol?

PATIENT X145
Okay the metoprolol I'm taking.

DOCTOR X145
You're taking 100 mg; you take that twice a day right?

PATIENT X145
Twice a day yeah, one pill I cut it in half and one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.

PATIENT X145
Half in the morning and half in the.

DOCTOR X145
Alright let's see, looks like they gave you some prednisone for a short time, that's gone okay.  That's mostly your medicines, is that right?

PATIENT X145
That sounds like it.

DOCTOR X145
Next time I want you to bring the medicine bottles in or bring a list of what you uh for sure take.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
But that's what I got on the list here.

PATIENT X145
Okay but I don't have anything for diabetic that I know of.

DOCTOR X145
The last time we talked about but we didn't give it to you.

PATIENT X145
Yeah something about the blood count was close or whatever so we didn't.

DOCTOR X145
Right.  That's why we sent you to the MOVE Clinic.

PATIENT X145
Oh.

DOCTOR X145
Now I remember.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Now I remember.  Um did you eat anything this morning?

PATIENT X145
Nope.

DOCTOR X145
No okay.  We may draw some labs.  Your Coumadin level's been pretty good.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Let see what your sugars, this was last June.  So last June you had some labs drawn in June.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
By 9 o'clock in the morning.  Do you happen to remember if you had eaten that day?

PATIENT X145
I don't think I did.

DOCTOR X145
You don't think you did.

PATIENT X145
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X145
Okay. 

PATIENT X145
Cause most time when I come here I don't eat.

DOCTOR X145
You don't eat just in case huh.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Alright.  So the other thing is before your glucose was 146, so it's better um.  We're going to draw some labs today.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
Depending what your sugars are.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
I might want to start you on a medicine for pre-diabetes.

PATIENT X145
Okay.  Pre-diabetes, does that mean, intercept sort of.

DOCTOR X145
You're right, from getting full-blown diabetes.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
The way we diagnose diabetes is we take your blood.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
And look to see what the sugar level is.  If the sugar is 125 or higher, two separate times after you haven't eaten for 12 hours or so then we can say you have diabetes.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
You're right on the border so back in June you were 126, that's elevated.  When I saw you before you were 140, also elevated.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
So those two together we basically can diagnose you with diabetes.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
But because you've been doing good, you lost some weight, you went to the MOVE Clinic, they exercised you right?

PATIENT X145
Yeah but actually uh I didn't lose it during the whole time I was with the MOVE Clinic I didn't lose one single, yeah I lost one pound.  I've lost all this weight since I left the MOVE Clinic.

DOCTOR X145
Huh.

PATIENT X145
I don't know if it's just now starting to catch up with me or if it's because I quit drinking the beer or what it is.

DOCTOR X145
That could be, that could be.  Um.

PATIENT X145
Cause I quit drinking the beer after I found out about the hepatitis.

DOCTOR X145
Okay. 

PATIENT X145
And then I never really drank a lot of beer, that was just like maybe two beers a day was about it so.  I don't think that's that much.  Saved me a lot of money though.

DOCTOR X145
We just recently diagnosed you with that hepatitis right?

PATIENT X145
Yeah, yeah, within the last, about a year.  You suspected a year ago and you finally finished all the tests maybe six or seven months ago.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah.

PATIENT X145
To confirm it.

DOCTOR X145
And we think that may be from a blood transfusion back when.

PATIENT X145
Right.

DOCTOR X145
You had the surgery for your stomach.

PATIENT X145
Right and then that's another thing, I applied for the VA benefits to be increased and they sent me a letter of rejection saying of course I can re you know.

DOCTOR X145
Reapply?

PATIENT X145
Reapply or whatever within the year but they said that they didn't think that that transfusion, it was so long ago, would have give it to me.  But it's a possibility for me to have it ever since then and not really know about it right?

DOCTOR X145
Right yeah.  I think we talked about that last time.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
And I put it in the note here.

PATIENT X145
Yeah and I know they had access to the records.

DOCTOR X145
Right.

PATIENT X145
And everything so.  But what I'm not quite understanding they said something about they were holding at 20%.  I think that maybe they raised it by 10% because I been drawing 10% so I'm not quite sure if they raised it a little bit or not.  Cause I just got the letters recently so.

DOCTOR X145
Let's see did they weigh you today?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
They did, let's see what.

PATIENT X145
She did.

DOCTOR X145
Your weight is 244.

PATIENT X145
I was down another pound or two so.

DOCTOR X145
So you were 258 yeah so that's good, let's see where you were a year ago.  Yeah that's pretty good.

PATIENT X145
A year ago.

DOCTOR X145
@@@ something we're concerned about.

PATIENT X145
A year ago I was up probably somewhere around 260 or 270 I'm guessing.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah you were 270.

PATIENT X145
Yeah 270.

DOCTOR X145
270.5.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Today 244.

PATIENT X145
So that's close to.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah.

PATIENT X145
Getting close to 30 pounds.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah, that's about 30 pounds, just under 30 pounds.  So that's pretty good and you've been trying to do better?

PATIENT X145
Well actually I haven't been trying at all, it's just.

DOCTOR X145
You haven't been trying at all.

PATIENT X145
Not really.

DOCTOR X145
So sometimes that can be concerning.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Losing weight without trying.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
That can be concerning.

PATIENT X145
Well, my diet has changed because I'm not, so well I eat a lot more fruit and stuff than I was before.  I love fruit.

DOCTOR X145
So you're eating healthier.

PATIENT X145
Probably yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Did the MOVE Clinic help with anything?  They tell you how to eat better?

PATIENT X145
Well that's one thing they did do because I've always liked fruit and everything and they kind of led me along the lines of stuff that I like pretty well but I wasn't really eating a whole lot that I like but so that kind of switched.  So they did have me switch my diet a little I think so that.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.  Um you still live with your wife right?

PATIENT X145
Correct.

DOCTOR X145
And before you told me you were sleeping in different rooms because your wife moves too much?

PATIENT X145
No she says I move too.

DOCTOR X145
You move.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.  She says I get to screaming and hollering for some reason.  I couldn't see where it would be my military experiencing causing any of that though so.

DOCTOR X145
Alright.  Alright.

PATIENT X145
Yeah they got me on that sleeping thing too but that doesn't seem to me that it's doing.

DOCTOR X145
What oh CPAP machine?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
That's good, that'll help your blood pressure.

PATIENT X145
Well, it takes me twice as long to go to sleep and then I wake up about every 30 minutes or so where before I used to go to sleep real quick and not wake up so.

DOCTOR X145
But they, I think I ordered that for you.

PATIENT X145
Ah somebody did, yeah, yeah you did.

DOCTOR X145
So they said you're having sleep apnea huh?

PATIENT X145
Yeah, it's not real bad just slight you know.

DOCTOR X145
You been using that sleeping machine all the time?

PATIENT X145
I'd say 90% of the time.

DOCTOR X145
Well that probably could help you lose weight too, believe it or not.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.  I been probably about 90% of the time I use it.  When we went on our vacation we were camping out in the woods, there was no electrical so I didn't use it that week.

DOCTOR X145
Right.  No that's okay.  Where'd you camp at?

PATIENT X145
Uh Devil's Den in Arkansas.

DOCTOR X145
Do you feel like you're more awake now?

PATIENT X145
Uh.

DOCTOR X145
Do you feel like may have more energy?  Cause sometimes when you have sleep apnea you get tired during the day.  

PATIENT X145
Uh, I seem to stay awake a little bit better but yeah.

DOCTOR X145
You don't feel as fatigued huh?

PATIENT X145
I still feel fatigued quite a bit but not quite as much as I did I guess maybe it's just, I'm not sure if it's that or not.

DOCTOR X145
You know seems like everything got a little bit better.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
We may have done something right.

PATIENT X145
Yep.

DOCTOR X145
And I would tell you that we probably should get another colonoscopy but you just had one, just had one.

PATIENT X145
Yeah I just had it.

DOCTOR X145
Last year so.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
You're good to go.

PATIENT X145
Well they told me I was good for another ten years.  I tell you what the pre-treatment's worse than the.

DOCTOR X145
That's the worst.  Did I do that to you?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
I think I did do that to you.

PATIENT X145
Yeah, yeah you did.

DOCTOR X145
Well we're getting you squared away though.  The only thing I want to see is when was the last time you had your cholesterol checked?

PATIENT X145
God I'm not sure.

DOCTOR X145
That may have been a little while.

PATIENT X145
I thought that was.

DOCTOR X145
That was last September.

PATIENT X145
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X145
You're probably due for that.

PATIENT X145
Hmm.

DOCTOR X145
So we can probably check your lipids.  Probably check your BMP.  We can check an A1c.

PATIENT X145
Well there's something else I want you to check, my left testicle for some reason.

DOCTOR X145
What's happened?

PATIENT X145
Uh it feels like, I feel uncomfortable, a little bit of pain in it, not a lot.

DOCTOR X145
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X145
And feel a little bit of pressure, sometimes it comes uh and it's getting where it's more often.  The thing of it is I don't go urinate or something.

DOCTOR X145
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X145
And the pain and pressure seem to relieve and go away.

DOCTOR X145
So pain in the left testicle right.

PATIENT X145
Right.  It's not real severe but it's you know.  It's and it feels like pressure and pain a little bit.

DOCTOR X145
Every day?

PATIENT X145
Yeah at least once a day or so.  Uh usually like I say I go urinate or something and, I have no problem with urination or anything like that.

DOCTOR X145
No problem.  Okay.  No burning.

PATIENT X145
No burning, no nothing.  It's just.

DOCTOR X145
So tell me more about your pain.

PATIENT X145
It's almost like.

DOCTOR X145
When did it come?

PATIENT X145
Well, different, sometimes at nighttime, sometimes in the middle of the day just, never any set time it just uh.  Feels like somebody kind of taking hold of it and kind of squeezing it a little bit or something.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.  What does it feel like, does it last a long time or is it just a few seconds?

PATIENT X145
No it lasts until I go urinate or something.  It starts out slightly and then it starts getting a little bit more and more pressure and a little bit more pain until I go to the washroom or something, relieve myself and then it seems to go away then for a while.  Now this has been going on probably for two or three months now but I don't know how long it's been going on.

DOCTOR X145
A few months?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Hmm.  Alright well why don't I have you sit up there and uh I'll take your blood pressure first cause I want to check and see if that's for real or.

PATIENT X145
Here?

DOCTOR X145
It's probably just because you walked.  So you had rehab today?

PATIENT X145
Yep.

DOCTOR X145
What were you doing over there?

PATIENT X145
They just had me doing.

DOCTOR X145
For the back.

PATIENT X145
Yeah it's for the back yeah they.

DOCTOR X145
How's the back pain doing?

PATIENT X145
It seems to be there all the time.  I mean it's not as severe as it was before but it seems like it ain't going away but.  It's been that way for years it seems like, just a.

DOCTOR X145
A little squeeze sorry.  So it's definitely not as high as it was.  Sorry.

PATIENT X145
No problem.

DOCTOR X145
Okay, I got about 130/80.

PATIENT X145
That's not bad.

DOCTOR X145
Not terrible, not terrible.  Alright um, I'm going to examine you too.  I'll have you take some deep breaths.  Again.  Good, again, good, again.  Okay I'm just going to feel your pulse.  Okay.  You still have that irregular heartbeat.

PATIENT X145
Yeah, I'll probably have that the rest of my life I guess.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah.

PATIENT X145
And it seems like I'm.

DOCTOR X145
Do you ever get swelling in the legs?

PATIENT X145
Yeah from time to time.  Seems like I run out of breath a lot easier than.

DOCTOR X145
Than before?

PATIENT X145
Than before too now so.

DOCTOR X145
Lay back.  I'm just going to feel on your belly a little bit.  So how far can you walk now?

PATIENT X145
I don't know.  I really don't know.

DOCTOR X145
You been doing physical therapy, you getting short of breath or no?

PATIENT X145
No when I'm walking upstairs, it's like when I go up the stairs or something.

DOCTOR X145
Take your drawers off and we'll take a look at that.  When you go up the stairs you get short of breath?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
How far can you go?

PATIENT X145
I don't know I'm not really trying but just seem like I'm winded when I get to the top of the stairs where I used to.  Drop the drawers and everything all the way down?

DOCTOR X145
Yeah.  I'll take a look here.

PATIENT X145
I've never really tried to see how far I could go or anything.

DOCTOR X145
But you notice that now you can't go as far?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.  Have you ever had a stress test?

PATIENT X145
Been a long time but yeah I had one.

DOCTOR X145
Show me where it's been bothering you the most.

PATIENT X145
Right in through there.

DOCTOR X145
Is it sore where I touch?

PATIENT X145
No.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.  I'm just going to check you for a hernia okay.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Go ahead and cough.  Again.  Same on the other side, cough.  I don't see anything obvious.  I'll ask my attending and see if we need to check the urine to make sure there's no infection in there.

PATIENT X145
Okay. 

DOCTOR X145
Um I'll see if he wants to come take a look at it.  The stress test was taken a long time ago right.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.  Back when I first started.  The last time was when I first started coming here on a regular basis.

DOCTOR X145
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X145
And that's when I wanted because I already knew I had the a fib.  

DOCTOR X145
Sure.

PATIENT X145
But of course they wanted their own you know, so that was the last time I took it, the chemical whatever.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah.

PATIENT X145
@@@.

DOCTOR X145
No that's okay.  I'm just going to see when you had a stress test last.  You had a treadmill.

PATIENT X145
I don't remember doing a treadmill.

DOCTOR X145
Well it might have been a long time.  Well this was in August 2009 they did an echocardiogram.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Did I do that?  That might have been something I ordered hmm.  But that looks pretty good.  Yeah that one's pretty good.  So the symptom of shortness of breath is only with exertion right?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
That's when you start to get a little more winded?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.

PATIENT X145
Just normal walking around it doesn't seem like.

DOCTOR X145
Oh when you.

PATIENT X145
Like when I ride the bike over there, it didn't seem to bother me.

DOCTOR X145
You have to ride a bike on a stationary place?

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
When does it seem to come, going up and down the stairs?

PATIENT X145
Going up and down the stairs, something like that or outside when it's real hot, on a real hot day.

DOCTOR X145
Do you think you could walk on a treadmill if we wanted you to?

PATIENT X145
Sure.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.  I'll talk with my attending about that.  I want to get some labs for you too.

PATIENT X145
Okay is that going to be done today or?

DOCTOR X145
Hopefully yeah, the labs.

PATIENT X145
Yeah.

DOCTOR X145
I'm just going to slip out with him and then we'll go from there okay.

PATIENT X145
Alright.

DOCTOR X145
Alright hold on one second.  So it says 20% service-connected right?

PATIENT X145
That's what it says?

DOCTOR X145
That's what is says in the computer.

PATIENT X145
Yeah before it was only 10% so I guess that they must have upped it.

DOCTOR X145
They may have.  Alright I'll be back in one second okay.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
Hang tight for me.

(DOCTOR OUT:  63:55  DOCTOR IN:  73:22)

DOCTOR X145
Alright so, here's what we're going to do for you, couple things.  We're going to check the labs like we talked about.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Uh I also want to order two tests one is an ultrasound of your testicle making sure that there's no hydrocele, there's no kind of cancer in there.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
No problems that I couldn't find on examining you.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
It feels to me like it's pretty benign.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Depending what that shows we may send you to the urologist.  Now your symptoms don't sound too concerning and because they're mild I'm willing to watch them for a bit and see what happens with them.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
Also number two, because of your increasing shortness of breath I want to do a stress test.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
Okay.

PATIENT X145
So all these, not today it's going to be.

DOCTOR X145
No, no, no.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
The ultrasound and the stress test are not going to be today correct.

PATIENT X145
Okay, but the lab.

DOCTOR X145
The labs will be today.

PATIENT X145
Well I just go down, that's blood right?

DOCTOR X145
You just go down or they can draw them here.

PATIENT X145
It doesn't matter to me if they want.

DOCTOR X145
If you want to just get them here I can put you in the Lab here, it might be quicker.

PATIENT X145
That's fine.

DOCTOR X145
Let me just, let me just order those labs so I can set you up there and get you in line.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
Um we're going to order a bit.

PATIENT X145
Okay you're going to redo all my prescriptions.

DOCTOR X145
I refilled them all already.

PATIENT X145
And you're going to add that one for the.

DOCTOR X145
What for.

PATIENT X145
For the pre-diabetes or whatever.

DOCTOR X145
Um I'm going to check a lab today called hemoglobin A1c.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
That'll tell us how your sugars have been over the last three months.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
If that's high I'll send you a prescription for diabetes medicine okay.

PATIENT X145
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X145
Um we're going to check your lipids.  I'm also going to check what's called alpha fetoprotein.  We checked that before.  We're going to check it again.  That's what monitors how your liver's doing.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh okay.  Yeah the liver doctor said something about technically they should be checking that every time I come in anymore.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah I'm going to check it now since you're here.

PATIENT X145
That again will be with the Lab right?

DOCTOR X145
Yeah, uh-huh.

PATIENT X145
So really once I leave the Lab I don't have to go anywhere today except.

DOCTOR X145
Home.

PATIENT X145
Then they'll be calling me and making.

DOCTOR X145
Yep they'll call you and get the ultrasound and the stress test taken care of.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
So let's see I just got to figure how to order that alpha fetoprotein.

PATIENT X145
Beats me.

DOCTOR X145
Make sure that you give them urine too.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
And we probably should check your prostate, so a PSA.

PATIENT X145
I thought you did that once before.

DOCTOR X145
We did.

PATIENT X145
And it came back clean but it still you can't be.

DOCTOR X145
This is something you check about once a year.

PATIENT X145
Okay.  Just as long as it ain't nothing like that colon thing.

DOCTOR X145
No this is a blood test.

PATIENT X145
Whew.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah that was bad huh?

PATIENT X145
Man drinking that stuff, I couldn't even get off the pot; I just sit there and drain.

DOCTOR X145
Sorry about that.

PATIENT X145
When they said it'd be ten years before I have to take it again maybe by then they'll have something better.

DOCTOR X145
Yeah.  Ten years before you have to do it again and at that time you may consider not even doing it you know.

PATIENT X145
If I live to be another ten years old.

DOCTOR X145
Right exactly.  Alright so let's see here, the ultrasound, scrotum.  I'll order it today and I'll tell them in the front.

PATIENT X145
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X145
So.

PATIENT X145

DOCTOR X145
Yep.

PATIENT X145
Okay.

DOCTOR X145
So I'm going to order a stress test and we're all set to go.  Stress test. What we're going to do is instead of the treadmill; well you could probably walk on a treadmill right?

PATIENT X145
Yeah I don't.

DOCTOR X145
What we'll do is you'll walk on the treadmill and then they'll give you.

PATIENT X145
The chemical.

DOCTOR X145

PATIENT X145

PATIENT X145
You guys gave me one once, when I first.

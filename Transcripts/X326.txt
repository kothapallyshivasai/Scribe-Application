DOCTOR X326
PATIENT?

PATIENT X326

DOCTOR X326
Oh sorry, I'm so sorry hi.

PATIENT X326
How you doing?

DOCTOR X326
How are you?  Good to see you again, both of you.  Come on back.  @@@.

PATIENT X326
Why don't you push that, maybe it would.

DOCTOR X326
How are you doing today?

PATIENT X326
Alright.

DOCTOR X326
Have a seat.

PATIENT X326
I called for uh; renew that one prescription, pravastatin.  

DOCTOR X326
Oh.

PATIENT X326
And they said I got to talk to a doctor.  Now I looked on my printout, not on there no more anyway.

DOCTOR X326
Hmm.

PATIENT X326
I don't take that no more?

DOCTOR X326
Uh I don't think I got, I didn't get any note saying that you needed more.  I'll check on that.

PATIENT X326
I just got a printout today.

DOCTOR X326
Right, yeah.

PATIENT X326
And it's not on there.

DOCTOR X326
Have you been taking every day though?

PATIENT X326
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X326
Oh he's out.

PATIENT X326
Yes, I'm out.

DOCTOR X326
When was the last time you took it?

PATIENT X326
Oh, I take it at night and it'd be tonight, otherwise it'd be last night or this morning.

DOCTOR X326
Okay.

PATIENT X326
Uh it's at nighttime so.  I took it last night.  Why isn't it on my list?

DOCTOR X326
Um it's expired so.

PATIENT X326
Oh I get it.

DOCTOR X326
Let's see.  Would you like it sent to you by mail?

PATIENT X326
Yeah.

DOCTOR X326
And then you're levothyroxine or your Synthroid that looks like it's been expired as well.

PATIENT X326
What is it?

DOCTOR X326
Your Synthroid, thyroid hormones.

PATIENT X326
Oh.  No I think that ran out wasn't it?

DOCTOR X326
Yeah it's called levothyroxine.  Synthroid is the trade name.

PATIENT X326
Oh.

DOCTOR X326
Same thing.  So we need to renew that for you.  

PATIENT X326
Looks like I still got some left on that one, I don't know, whatever.

DOCTOR X326
Okay.

PATIENT X326
DOCTOR wants me to keep taking that.

SECOND PERSON X326
For what reason?  The thyroid?

PATIENT X326
Yeah.

DOCTOR X326
Now let's go through medications.  Okay, so overall you've been okay though since the last time I saw you a few months ago?

PATIENT X326
Now what?

DOCTOR X326
You've been doing okay since I saw you last?

PATIENT X326
Yeah.  That's how I play.

DOCTOR X326
Okay um.

SECOND PERSON X326
It's amazing how you young people can do that.

DOCTOR X326
You know, but it takes a lot of practice just to learn it, for it and train your mind.

SECOND PERSON X326
Yeah, I mean they're training little kids in preschool and that's you know.

DOCTOR X326
Yeah when I was growing up we learned it when we were in middle school.

SECOND PERSON X326
Yeah.

DOCTOR X326
And we didn't, there were no computers @@@.

SECOND PERSON X326
Oh my God, just when I see your fingers move and I see my little grandkids come over and start just typing away like crazy on the computer.

DOCTOR X326
Yeah, yeah.  Um okay so you're still taking your Coreg 12.5 twice a day for your heart?

PATIENT X326
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X326
You don't have them memorized, your medications?

PATIENT X326
Yeah that's like a half a tablet yeah.

DOCTOR X326
And then the water pill you only take when your foot swells right?

PATIENT X326
I been taking it every day.

SECOND PERSON X326
No.

DOCTOR X326
Did you have it.

SECOND PERSON X326
Every day, I don't know why cause he keeps going to the bathroom all the time.  Is it necessary for him to take it every day?

DOCTOR X326
It's um it's not necessary but it helps control your blood pressure and takes like the fluid off.

SECOND PERSON X326
Oh.

DOCTOR X326
It's not a bad thing if you're doing both and your blood pressure today was great.

SECOND PERSON X326
Yeah.

DOCTOR X326
Um, let's see and then um you're on the pravastatin 40 mg which has been reordered now.  Um and you saw Cardiology.  I had you go see them @@@.

PATIENT X326
They added and he.

DOCTOR X326
They started the lisinopril.

PATIENT X326
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X326
Um then they stopped the Plavix.

PATIENT X326
Right.

DOCTOR X326
Alright.

SECOND PERSON X326
Is that a good thing?

DOCTOR X326
Yeah I mean the Plavix you don't need forever.  It's only for you know a time for a heart attack or something.  Um and then they also, you still follow with the Coumadin Clinic right?  Your INR today was 2.66 which is good.  Um and then I saw you walk in with a cane, you looked like you were doing fine.  How's that going, any falls or?

PATIENT X326
I didn't fall.

DOCTOR X326
No falls.  That's always good.  No falls.

PATIENT X326
Next spring.

DOCTOR X326
Um alright and then we're continuing your Synthroid and you did say that DOCTOR already talked to you about that.  Um and in terms of a health maintenance there's really not a whole lot, right now, you know given your age you kind of already had all the shots that you needed and you don't need any more colonoscopies, your last one's normal.  Um and then we talked the last time about following your abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Uh you didn't really have one; it was 2.9 centimeters which may be a little bit more than normal but not quite an aneurysm.  Uh that was seen on CT last summer and then we talked and you didn't really want to follow it every year.  Um so it looks like you're doing pretty well um.

PATIENT X326
Does it say what my blood pressure today and Coumadin does it way what it was?  Yeah it was 2. uh actually no, yeah 2.66 today.

DOCTOR X326
Oh that's good.  Yep.  And I didn't really need you to do any more labs from just the time before and if you wouldn't mind actually now that you're up here, just having a seat on the table.  And I'll just take a quick listen to your heart and lungs.  

PATIENT X326
Can you pull that out?

DOCTOR X326
Oh sure, there you go.

SECOND PERSON X326
For his fat feet.

DOCTOR X326
Let me see if I can get it to work, no I don't think it's going to work, sorry.  Sometimes it.

PATIENT X326
Alright.

DOCTOR X326
Do I need to help you?

PATIENT X326
No.

DOCTOR X326
Okay.  Alright.  Take a quick listen to your neck and then your heart and lungs.  Take deep breaths in and out.  Can you open your mouth for me?  Tongue, okay.  I'm just checking your pulse.  I want to take a look at your legs.  Okay you have just a tiny bit of swelling.  Do you feel like this gets worse when you've been on your feet?

PATIENT X326
Oh I don't even pay attention, I don't know.

DOCTOR X326
It's just barely anything but the water pill is good for that so you're okay if you don't have it every day.

PATIENT X326
That's what I take them for.

DOCTOR X326
Yeah.  Okay.  Alright I'm going to run over and talk with my attending really quick and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X326
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X326
We have to do that unfortunately.

(DOCTOR OUT:  54:11  DOCTOR IN:  56:56)

DOCTOR X326
Alright.  You're actually good to go um.  I put in all of your refills to be mailed to you.

PATIENT X326
Okay.

DOCTOR X326
And then if you need any labs I'll take care of that before and they'll just call you but I don't really need to see you back for six months.

PATIENT X326
Good.

DOCTOR X326
You're doing pretty good um.  You know the main thing last time was having you see Cardiology and managing your medications and your blood pressure is controlled, that looks perfect.

SECOND PERSON X326
He's going for eye surgery in June.

DOCTOR X326
Okay.

PATIENT X326
Cataracts.

DOCTOR X326
Oh I see okay good.  Um but besides you know the things we already talked about there's really nothing left for me to do.

SECOND PERSON X326
Okay.

DOCTOR X326
So you're doing good.

PATIENT X326
The only reason I use that wheelchair is cause it's a long walk to the parking lot.

DOCTOR X326
I know, that's why they're available.  But I watched you walk, you're walking very well.

PATIENT X326
Yeah.

DOCTOR X326
With the cane so that's good.

SECOND PERSON X326
Thank you.

DOCTOR X326
You're very welcome.  Let me walk you over to this.  Alright sir.

PATIENT X326
Okay.

DOCTOR X326
Nice seeing you again, take care.

PATIENT X326
Take care.

DOCTOR X326
Take care.

SECOND PERSON X326
Yeah thank you.

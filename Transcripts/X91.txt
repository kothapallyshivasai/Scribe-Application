DOCTOR X91
You didn't have like a sudden pop or?

DOCTOR X91
How about is it worse when you walk up stairs or down?

PATIENT X91
Well when I'm walking down I have to you know use this one more and I try to stay off of this, cause I might buckle and that'd make me fall.

DOCTOR X91
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X91
You know.  

DOCTOR X91
Is it stiff?

PATIENT X91

DOCTOR X91
Does that hurt?

PATIENT X91
No, not at all.

DOCTOR X91
Does the pain shoot down your leg or is it just localized over the kneecap?

PATIENT X91
It's more just in the kneecap, inside, like I feel like it's in the bone.

DOCTOR X91
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X91
You know.

DOCTOR X91
I think you've got a little bit of fluid around there.

PATIENT X91
What'd I do injure it or something?

DOCTOR X91
Um, I think you've got some arthritis.

PATIENT X91
Yeah.  Around my elbows hurt a lot too.  They've been hurting.

DOCTOR X91
@@@ overall.

PATIENT X91
Oh.  @@@ work I do @@@.  I don't pick up nothing I can't pick up.  I won't even try it.

DOCTOR X91
Can you take off your socks for me?

PATIENT X91
Sure, I'm sorry I should do it before.

DOCTOR X91
That's okay, no problem.

PATIENT X91
Here's the other thing I do, I forget.  You know it's a bad thing from doing drugs all my life I guess, stupid me.

DOCTOR X91

DOCTOR X91

PATIENT X91

DOCTOR X91
Is the pain persistent @@@?

PATIENT X91
Yeah.  It could be longer too, you know, there's some pain close to where it was.

DOCTOR X91
Is it right over the top of it or in the inside, on the outside?

PATIENT X91
What the pain?

DOCTOR X91
Yeah.

PATIENT X91
In the inside, the bone.  That's what it feels like to me.

DOCTOR X91
But @@@ inside.

PATIENT X91

DOCTOR X91
Aleve.

PATIENT X91

DOCTOR X91
Does it help?

DOCTOR X91

PATIENT X91
You know I mean real bad and it's really bothering me.

DOCTOR X91
How many times do you go per week?

PATIENT X91
@@@ per week, I go like twice a day or something.  I go normal, but it just hurts, you know what I mean and it trickles out, @@@.

DOCTOR X91
Okay and then the other thing is.

PATIENT X91

PATIENT X91

DOCTOR X91
Apply it once a day when you have pain there, you can just see how it goes.  You know you can take Aleve you know periodically for the pain as well.

PATIENT X91

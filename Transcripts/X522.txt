DOCTOR X522
PATIENT. 

PATIENT X522
Okay @@@.  Remember which way to go doctor okay.  And the lady just checked me with some machine or something.

DOCTOR X522
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X522
Go in, okay doctor.

DOCTOR X522
Right here.

PATIENT X522
Alright.

DOCTOR X522
Uh PATIENT how are you doing?

PATIENT X522
I think I'm fine doctor.  

DOCTOR X522
Let me just pull up your computer.

PATIENT X522
I don't have nothing, no complaints.  No pain or nothing so, I guess everything seems to be pretty good.

DOCTOR X522
Okay. 

PATIENT X522
Ya'll give me them pills and I'm here.

DOCTOR X522
Uh you were in the hospital a little while ago for some diarrhea?

PATIENT X522
Yes.

DOCTOR X522
Is that gone?

PATIENT X522
It's been gone the day after they discharged me and I only took that pill for one time and then everything was gone and I just don't take it the next morning cause so far, so good.

DOCTOR X522
Good.

PATIENT X522
And I see I have those pills left.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.

PATIENT X522
Save them for another day or something.  I hope I never have to do it.  I wonder what happened.  Maybe it something I ate I guess, I don't know.

DOCTOR X522
Probably yeah.

PATIENT X522
But the other than that I hadn't had any problem.  I love to eat.

DOCTOR X522
That's good.  Alright.  I see your blood pressure's good.

PATIENT X522
And I go play bridge and I go to the race track.

DOCTOR X522
That's great.

PATIENT X522
Oh yeah I enjoy.  Haven't had anything to do with sex but I have to get on and do that too.

DOCTOR X522
The last time you were here, did you get your blood drawn?

PATIENT X522
Yes I did.  I think so yes I did.  Because you want to know something and you concerned something wrong you would call me or something I don't know.

DOCTOR X522
Right.

PATIENT X522
Yes sir because I left from here and went right on over.

DOCTOR X522
Okay cause we wanted to check your blood sugar to check you know how your diabetes was doing.

PATIENT X522
Well it's doing good doc.  Sometime I think it's really low.

DOCTOR X522
Your blood sugar?

PATIENT X522
Yeah it's been low.

DOCTOR X522
Do you check it at home?

PATIENT X522
Yes I do.  I take that thing and I checked it the other day and I ate a lot of fruit and apple pie and it was 116, but it's been in the 60s, 70s and the 80s.

DOCTOR X522
Okay do you ever feel dizzy or like you're gonna pass out?

PATIENT X522
No.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.

PATIENT X522
I mean when I seem to wake up in the morning, don't feel too good, then it's very low.  So I drink a lot of orange juice.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.

PATIENT X522
I mostly know when it's really low but it has got down to the mid 60s.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.

PATIENT X522
Is that too low or what?

DOCTOR X522
Yeah 60 is low but if you feel like dizzy um then you, you know that's a problem.  So are you taking any medications for your diabetes?  No huh.

PATIENT X522
No they don't give me anything.

DOCTOR X522
Right.

PATIENT X522
I just kind of watch it and check it, like you said before, every other day check it you know to see what's happening.

DOCTOR X522
Yeah and so you know basically if you have these feelings of like dizziness or kind of feel like weak, you know, just take some candies or drink some juice.

PATIENT X522
Yeah when I can tell, a little piece of candy @@@ in case I need it.

DOCTOR X522
Good.

PATIENT X522
No I haven't had any @@@ with those so far.

DOCTOR X522
Okay or uh.

PATIENT X522
And as a matter of fact, I didn't bring it in today okay.

DOCTOR X522
Or you could drink some juice.

PATIENT X522
Well I drank a little orange juice.

DOCTOR X522
Yeah.

PATIENT X522
In the morning.  I didn't drink any this morning so I feel fine this morning.

DOCTOR X522
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X522
So it must be that maybe cause I ate a big slice of apple pie last night.  No when I feel pretty bad I'm gonna jump on that orange juice right quick and then take it.  After everything in the morning, you know when I take the other sugar candy.

DOCTOR X522
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X522
No they don't give me no pills, not in a long time for that.

DOCTOR X522
Yeah I don't think you need it.

PATIENT X522
No.

DOCTOR X522
That would probably drop your sugar even lower.

PATIENT X522
No I don't want to do that.  Ya'll been taking good care of me so I have no problems whatsoever.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.

PATIENT X522
And I'm gonna do what you tell me to do and that's it.  How did the blood thing come out?

DOCTOR X522
From the last time you were here?

PATIENT X522
Yeah.

DOCTOR X522
Uh.

PATIENT X522
Cause you didn't call me.

DOCTOR X522
Yeah it was normal.

PATIENT X522
Okay well then I'm, that was it because I was waiting to hear from you and then I didn't get no call.  That's about it.  About the only thing I do, I sleep a lot.  I rest and I can be looking at the TV and go to sleep.

DOCTOR X522
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X522
@@@.

DOCTOR X522
How about at nighttime?  Do you sleep at nighttime?

PATIENT X522
Oh yeah I sleep and then I have to go to the bathroom.  Let's see when I go, if I go at 9 o'clock, it's about 1 o'clock and then by the next morning.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.  Uh that's not too bad.  I mean you know.

PATIENT X522
It may be because I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR X522
Yeah.

PATIENT X522
Because I know when I'm traveling on the streets I don't drink much water but at night when I get home I start drinking a lot of water.

DOCTOR X522
Yeah, that'll do it.

PATIENT X522
Does that do it?

DOCTOR X522
Yeah.  Try not to drink or eat anything like two hours before you go to sleep, before you lay down.

PATIENT X522
Okay.

DOCTOR X522
And then uh that way you know in two hours, if you drink a lot of water you'll urinate most of it out.

PATIENT X522
Okay.  I try to drink a quart a day.

DOCTOR X522
Yeah so you won't have to get up.

PATIENT X522
When I drink @@@ more.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.

PATIENT X522
Well thank you.

DOCTOR X522
Alright, mind if I listen to your heart and lungs?

PATIENT X522
Yes, you want me to take this.

DOCTOR X522
No you're fine, we're good.  Have you had any uh chest pain or?

PATIENT X522
No no, no doctor, nothing.

DOCTOR X522
Alright have you had any feeling like your heart's racing?

PATIENT X522
No.

DOCTOR X522
Any shortness of breath?

PATIENT X522
A little short of breath, now that's the only thing I could see.

DOCTOR X522
Okay when does that happen?

PATIENT X522
I mean when I do a lot of walking.  Now see I have to walk a block and three quarters of a block going to the bus stop to go to the food store so I have to stop and rest one time.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.

PATIENT X522
And so far this morning I've been upstairs and downstairs, I didn't have to stop.

DOCTOR X522
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X522

PATIENT X188
Yeah.


DOCTOR X188
@@@ okay.  All right.  Dr. DOCTOR usually is the person who takes care of you?


PATIENT X188
Yeah.


DOCTOR X188
Okay.


PATIENT X188
Well he.


DOCTOR X188
What can I do for ya?


PATIENT X188
Well, the reason uh we called today is they called me to uh, uh talk to my doctor about the brace I had on my legs.


DOCTOR X188
Okay.


PATIENT X188
The reason I didn't uh wear it today is because uh uh the weather was bad and I couldn't get transportation, anybody drive me, so I took it off and drove it myself.  But for the past four or five days now I've been taking it off after supper which is 4 o'clock till about 6 and I'm walkin around the room and going downstairs and stuff like that, not doing any steps and things and it hasn't been bothering me.


DOCTOR X188
Okay.


PATIENT X188
I got the new walker so it helps.


DOCTOR X188
Before that it was bothering you?


PATIENT X188
Yeah, I my balance and stuff like that and uh, uh, the swelling and everything went down and they finally took more x-rays and it so they said it wasn’t an infection or anything it was arthritic, arthritic condition.


DOCTOR X188
Oh.


PATIENT X188
And they can't give me nothing for it until after the operation I'm having Thursday.


DOCTOR X188
Okay.  Do you have some left knee pain?


PATIENT X188
Not now, no.


DOCTOR X188
That's what it was like before.



PATIENT X188
Yeah, this whole thing, I couldn't sit, I couldn't bend it.


DOCTOR X188
Okay.


PATIENT X188
You know like now I can, I always have to keep it straight, but for the past couple of months I've been wearing that brace and just taking it off at night.


DOCTOR X188
And now you're taking it off after dinner?


PATIENT X188
Yeah.  Like uh about three days now I've been taking it off and walking around and . . . 


DOCTOR X188
You've been able to walk okay?


PATIENT X188
Yeah, now yeah, yeah, real good now.  Before I couldn't, without without that brace I couldn't walk uh, I couldn't walk five feet.

DOCTOR X188
Okay.  You're not wearing any right now though?


PATIENT X188
No, no.  And the antibiotics they gave me and painkillers they gave me have actually been killing, killing the stuff and @@@.


DOCTOR X188
Now, so who gave you that uh, those medications that you're talking about?


PATIENT X188
Uh, I got the paper here, in the Emergency Room.


DOCTOR X188
Okay, that was when you were here at the @@@


PATIENT X188
Yeah, yeah.


DOCTOR X188
All right.


PATIENT X188
She didn't do nothing with me, I haven't seen her since you know, I think, I didn't know you're supposed to talk to her, I thought I was supposed to go back to the Emergency and they would take it off or something, that's the reason uh I couldn't see her until way up till next year.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah.  All right.  I'm gonna read, just looking at the X-ray report.


PATIENT X188
Yeah.


DOCTOR X188
All right, looks like things are doing a lot better.  The x-ray looks fine and it sounds like your symptoms are better now?


PATIENT X188
I'm smiling.


DOCTOR X188
Uh-huh.  Let's take a look here.  All right.  So where was the pain mainly?


PATIENT X188
Right in this, in this area here.  I couldn't do this and if I did, I'd be crying.


DOCTOR X188
@@@.


PATIENT X188
It's specific pain.


DOCTOR X188
And now you're able to move it better?


PATIENT X188
Yes if I don't, if I don't like in bed, if I don't twist too fast, too far, uh I'm alright.


DOCTOR X188
Good.


PATIENT X188
If I do I feel it.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah.


PATIENT X188
But otherwise if I just take my time getting up and walking and turning and that stuff, hey I can do without the brace, I even drove a car first time in two months.


DOCTOR X188
Alright, that's cool.  And the other knee how's that one doing?


PATIENT X188
Well that's uh, it ain't bad but you know, yeah.  I figured it's gonna go the same way.



DOCTOR X188
Yeah.


PATIENT X188
And that's tough, I don't know why.


DOCTOR X188
Okay.  Well since its, since it’s doing so much better I don't think that we have a whole lot of work to do today.  I'm glad to hear that.


PATIENT X188
Yeah, you, oh God.  I talked it over with the head nurse at the retirement place and I said off the record, I said what'd happen to me if I, if I took it off and I sit for a couple of hours instead of taking it off at 9 or 10 o'clock at night and going to bed, what if I take it off at 6 and walking around with a walker and she said try it, so she was with me three nights in a row.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah.


PATIENT X188
And she says how ya doing, how's your balance, you tell me how my balance is and she say you're good alright.


DOCTOR X188
Alright.


PATIENT X188
Try it.



DOCTOR X188
I would say just follow that same pattern, take it off a little bit earlier.


PATIENT X188
Yeah.


DOCTOR X188
And make sure that you've got some stability.


PATIENT X188
Yeah.


DOCTOR X188
Alright good.


PATIENT X188
With this is the new walker that they gave me downstairs it helps a lot.  I borrowed a buddy of mines @@@.  I used to walk with a cane but that was not stable enough and I couldn't drive my car but uh no, as far as my sugar and blood pressure, I I brought my books with me if you want.


DOCTOR X188
No that's alright I'm going to have Dr. DOCTOR take care of most of that.


PATIENT X188
Alright, okay, alright.


DOCTOR X188
I think though looking at your numbers everything looks very good.


PATIENT X188
Uh-huh.


DOCTOR X188
You're uh diabetes looks good.


PATIENT X188
Uh, I need some test strips for my sugar, uh, do I call the . . .

DOCTOR X188
No I can get it for ya.


PATIENT X188
Yeah, oh okay.  I got about ten strips left, Monday, Wednesday and Friday and that's three, six, nine, I've got about the end of the month to go with.  I always like to get ahead of time.  No that's good to hear.  No all I got to do is sweat out Thursday.


DOCTOR X188
Thursday what's that?


PATIENT X188
That's the operation of the colon or the bladder.


DOCTOR X188
Oh yeah that's right.


PATIENT X188
And that's what I'm afraid of.


DOCTOR X188
You're going to be okay.


PATIENT X188
Um.  In the 1970s, late 1970s, I had prostate cancer and that was uh partially malignant and stuff like that.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah.


PATIENT X188
So, and I couldn't do nothing for, I went there the day after, the Monday after Labor Day and I didn't go back to work until the week of Thanksgiving so, all that time off, I figured oh God this things gonna be the same way, I'm kind of jumpy.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah, I don't know if this one's gonna be quite like that.


PATIENT X188
No?


DOCTOR X188
I don't think it is.


PATIENT X188
And every time I hear the word malignancy that, that uh, that's what my wife died of.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah, it makes you think about that.


PATIENT X188
Yeah.


DOCTOR X188
Well.


PATIENT X188
And me, I as a Polish guy that's a joke.


DOCTOR X188
Come on up here.


PATIENT X188
That's a joke, I I you talk about being Polish and that's got two strikes on ya.


DOCTOR X188
Ha, ha.


PATIENT X188
But uh, the first strike was in the 1970s with malignant cancer of the prostate, @@@ was malignant so that's what I'm kind of scared of.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah well, you'll just have to see what happens.


PATIENT X188
You want me to take it off?


DOCTOR X188
That's okay I'll put it on over the top.  @@@ I'm gonna check it again.


PATIENT X188
Yeah, uh-huh.


DOCTOR X188
I like your hat.


PATIENT X188
That's yeah, uh, uh, I was buying some tools at a tool place right by the house there.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah.


PATIENT X188
And uh, and she says my sister works there as an assistant or something, to help vets and she gave me this.
DOCTOR X188
Good enough.  Alright, @@@.  Alright you can lay back down, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go talk with my boss about what's going on but I think I like the way your knee is healing.


PATIENT X188
Hey I would be, I wouldn't be smiling if it uh wasn't, look.  Oh God this thing's been bothering me for a long time.


DOCTOR X188
The knee finally, the knee is finally getting better huh?


PATIENT X188
Oh yeah.


DOCTOR X188
Well I wouldn't give up on the brace all together.


PATIENT X188
No, no, no.


DOCTOR X188
@@@.  Alright.  Yeah, I'll be right back okay.


PATIENT X188
Yeah.

(DOCTOR OUT: 84:04 DOCTOR IN:  88:46)

DOCTOR X188
Okay.  I think uh, about the knee, what I want you to do is wear the brace when you're not gonna be too active um, during the day.  Take it off after dinner.  You can try taking it off a little earlier each day if you want to, make sure that the knee is feeling good and not feeling off balance or anything and then as you gradually take it away you won't need it at all but I'd keep it around.


PATIENT X188
Oh yeah, that uh, I got it right by the bed there.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah because I think it's gonna be helpful for you to have around.


PATIENT X188
Oh yeah.


DOCTOR X188
If it feels unstable or starts to hurt again.


PATIENT X188
Right.


DOCTOR X188
Okay?


PATIENT X188
I feel uh, I could never do this, this or this, oh God.


DOCTOR X188
That's terrific.  No, I'm I'm so happy for you as well.


PATIENT X188
@@@ for years.


DOCTOR X188
Yeah.


PATIENT X188
And uh, I thought I'd found a place, then the @@@ uh this thing here, oh shit @@@ uh.


DOCTOR X188
And you said they wouldn't let you stay there?


PATIENT X188
Uh no, ya see, uh, the years of @@@ and stuff like that you know, they kind of you know, and I figured that's what I wanted you know and I lost my wife 13 years ago and I'm living by myself and no cooking, no nothing and you know and then finding a place you got meals and once a week they, they come in and clean your apartment and stuff, they have good meals.

DOCTOR X188

DOCTOR X188

PATIENT X188
And uh, I hope I can continue with that but the way I'm going now, I feel like I'm lucky if I reach 85.  I just passed 84 so I don't know.


DOCTOR X188

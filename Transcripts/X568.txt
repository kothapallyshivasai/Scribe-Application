DOCTOR X568
Um, let's see what else.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT X568
That depends, I do.

DOCTOR X568
Do you want to stop?

PATIENT X568
I'm trying.  I smoke maybe a half a pack a day?

DOCTOR X568
Okay.

PATIENT X568
I need to quit.

DOCTOR X568
Okay.

PATIENT X568
Cause it's not good for my high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X568
It's not good period.

PATIENT X568
Period.  I got to say @@@ doc, as of this date I'm gonna.  I don't want no gum.  What you think?  They gave me some gum but.

DOCTOR X568
I think every person is different.

PATIENT X568
I know, I uh.

DOCTOR X568
And your, let's lay it all out and let's be perfectly honest with you.

PATIENT X568
Thank you, I would like to be.

DOCTOR X568
So smoking has probably been the least of your issues as far as substance abuse in general.

PATIENT X568
That's correct.

DOCTOR X568
Okay.

PATIENT X568
That's correct.

DOCTOR X568
Um so if you are still smoking a little bit, but you are no longer using cocaine?

PATIENT X568
Doing heroin no.

DOCTOR X568
Heroin.

PATIENT X568
No sir, no sir.

DOCTOR X568
What about alcohol?

PATIENT X568
No sir, never been a drinker.

DOCTOR X568
Good.

PATIENT X568
That, if I drink a beer, that lead me to get into heroin.  That's a gateway to go get that.

DOCTOR X568
Yeah.

PATIENT X568
Alcohol I have all day but I go get heroin.

DOCTOR X568
Yeah.

PATIENT X568
So I don't.

DOCTOR X568
So I mean in the short term, if smoking is a way for you to not use coke and not use heroin.

PATIENT X568
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X568
Then so be it but if you are done with that, it's over and it's no longer something that ever crosses your mind once in a while.

PATIENT X568
That doesn't cross, I was going through that crisis and that point, but wasn't no excuse for that cause the problem was still there.  We would have had to go through but I said what am I doing, so now I just, abstain, don't go around no people place and things and I been doing good doctor.  I been doing good.

DOCTOR X568
Now do you feel that that's where you're at then absolutely you should work on the smoking.  Um and you know it's different.  Some people they can just stop.

PATIENT X568
I know.  My sister stopped.

DOCTOR X568
But some people you know, the gum works, there are patches that work, there's you know just kind of drawing a line in the sand saying January 1st 2011 will be the day I quit.  I mean you're gonna have to find what that is for you.

PATIENT X568
And you know what doc, I'm gonna try.  I tried the gum but I was psyching myself out.  That gum helped me listen, I chewed two pieces, three pieces I put in my mouth.

DOCTOR X568
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X568
And that whole day I didn't smoke until later on that night.  I went about nine hours so it must be working to get my mind to get one.  I smoked a couple puffs and it didn't taste right.

DOCTOR X568
Good.

PATIENT X568
So see I think that gum might work for me.

DOCTOR X568
Well that's good.  I mean.

PATIENT X568
Yeah so we gonna work together doctor cause I got to quit.  I'm 55; I'll be 56 next year.  I'm not getting any younger.

DOCTOR X568
Okay.

PATIENT X568
And that's when the body needs to stop drinking and drugging.  I drug, but things start happening if you take it and I haven't used since that day and I thank God, just for the day now, one day at a time, you know how it go.  So doctor I'm doing great and I really think me being uh served my country helping me cause if not I don't know what I would be.  I smoke though, this is it.  You know this is my start and I'm doing something for me.  I'm making the next step, you all are helping me, willing to help me but I got a.  I'm my worst enemy so I been like that.

DOCTOR X568
And best friend.

PATIENT X568

They say the size of one of them is bigger but I just remember @@@ anyway the veins in one of my scrotum sac is bigger and one is bigger than the other.  They say that ain't no problem.  The only thing I huge like that.

DOCTOR X568
No.

PATIENT X568
And at times it hurt but it goes away.

DOCTOR X568
So is it when you're walking?

PATIENT X568
Yeah a long time.

DOCTOR X568
Yeah.

PATIENT X568
I thought it was from that hernia but they say the hernia repair is good.

DOCTOR X568
Yeah, yeah I mean it could be because sometimes when they do that they get into the, the wall of your abdominal muscles.

PATIENT X568
Okay.

DOCTOR X568
When they check that.

PATIENT X568
Okay.

DOCTOR X568
Well it goes down all the way down into your hip bone.

Okay.

DOCTOR X568
And so sometimes just from cutting that, you know the more you walk, the more you stretch.

PATIENT X568
Okay.

DOCTOR X568
It every time you walk.

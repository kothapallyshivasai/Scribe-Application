SECOND PERSON X176
@@@.

DOCTOR X176
Well tell me about the urinating, what's going on with that?

PATIENT X176
Yeah well uh I stopped taking, I stopped taking the terazosin.

DOCTOR X176
Why?

PATIENT X176
Because I thought it was affecting my urine.  My urine pattern.  So when I stopped taking terazosin my urine got worse but I didn't take the terazosin because I thought the terazosin was causing me to get up three times a night.

DOCTOR X176
It should be causing you to get up less and maybe letting you get up three instead of six.

PATIENT X176
Oh yeah?

DOCTOR X176
When did you stop it?

PATIENT X176
I stopped it maybe about a month ago.

DOCTOR X176
Alright and how have your symptoms been since then?

PATIENT X176
Uh well I keep more urine in my bladder.

DOCTOR X176
You keep more urine in your bladder.

PATIENT X176
More urine in my bladder and I go to the bathroom.

DOCTOR X176
So you have incomplete emptying.

PATIENT X176
Incomplete emptying and I go to the washroom more often.  I go to the washroom sometimes every hour or every two hours depending on how much urine comes out.

DOCTOR X176
Yeah so, now we know the terazosin was probably helping you some didn't it.

PATIENT X176
Probably so yeah.  But they've given me a prescription of something else now.  I forget what the doctor said.

DOCTOR X176
Just today?

PATIENT X176
Today they supposed to be giving me a new prescription but I think they want to check my bladder first.  Check my bladder and my kidney first.

DOCTOR X176
I was going to say I don't see any.

PATIENT X176
I think they say within a month they gonna have me back and they gonna check my urine and they gonna check my kidney and make sure my functioning because I'm keeping too much urine in my bladder.  So I'm running back for that now.

DOCTOR X176

DOCTOR X572
Okay you take that one once a day.

PATIENT X572

PATIENT X572

DOCTOR X572
When do you think you take that one?

PATIENT X572
Uh I take it once no I take it twice a day.

DOCTOR X572

PATIENT X572

PATIENT X572
You told me to have that.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah.  But it's okay, have a seat.  

PATIENT X572
You had it.

DOCTOR X572
Oh no it's okay.

PATIENT X572
@@@ now friend.  @@@.

DOCTOR X572
I want to listen to it and see.  Remember the last time you were here we talked about how this was the first time coming to the doctor it was kind of a new thing for you.

PATIENT X572
Right.

DOCTOR X572
So it kind of takes some time to get used to all of the medications and how to take them and all that stuff.

PATIENT X572
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X572
But what I want you to remember is you don't feel sick but you have a very sick heart and you have a big body and you need to take the medications for this so as long as you understand that you need to make sure you review your medication list and you take them as it's written.  Are you taking the medication called Plavix?  The one they told you to stop before the surgery?

PATIENT X572
Hmm.  I think it's called Plavix or another name for it.

DOCTOR X572
Clopidogrel?

PATIENT X572
Yes.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah did you stop that one like you were supposed to?

PATIENT X572
Yes.

DOCTOR X572
Okay are you taking your aspirin yeah?

PATIENT X572
Yes.

DOCTOR X572
You restarted the.

PATIENT X572
Started taking it again.

DOCTOR X572
Okay good but no Plavix, no clopidogrel.

PATIENT X572
You told me to stop taking that.

DOCTOR X572
Good.  Are you having any problems with your medications or do you have any questions about them?

PATIENT X572
No.

DOCTOR X572
Now the medications were the main thing I was worried about last time and again what's the most important thing in terms of how your health is doing?  Do you remember what we talked about?

PATIENT X572
No.

DOCTOR X572
You don't remember?

PATIENT X572
And I'm not drinking anymore.

DOCTOR X572
That was one of the big ones was the drinking.

PATIENT X572
Yeah I stopped drinking.

DOCTOR X572
And then other big one was uh your heart.

PATIENT X572
My heart.

DOCTOR X572
So you understand it right.

PATIENT X572
Right I can't do no more exercising, no @@@ stuff like that?

DOCTOR X572
So you still do that?

PATIENT X572
Yeah.

DOCTOR X572
Okay.

PATIENT X572
My blood pressure is back to, what was it 135 is what it was.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah and for you.

PATIENT X572
It was 180 at one time, I remember that.

DOCTOR X572
Do you know what your goal blood pressure should be?

PATIENT X572
No.

DOCTOR X572
So because you have heart disease, now when I say heart disease I was talking about the blockages in your heart.

PATIENT X572
Right.

DOCTOR X572
Because you had that, your goal blood pressure should be 120 on the top and 80 on the bottom and you're above that right now.

PATIENT X572
135 yeah.  I thought, I asked the lady and she said that's normal.

DOCTOR X572
She didn't know you had all these other, it's normal for somebody who doesn't have heart disease.

PATIENT X572
Normal for normal people.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah but you're not normal anymore.

PATIENT X572
I ain't normal man.

DOCTOR X572
So we don't mean it in a bad way we mean it in just the, that way we identify you as somebody we need to take close care of.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
So your heart doesn't get you.

PATIENT X572
Yeah.

DOCTOR X572
Does that make sense?

PATIENT X572
Yeah.

DOCTOR X572
I'm not saying your abnormal to make you feel bad.  We just say that you don't have a normal heart anymore; you have blockages in the arteries and that.

PATIENT X572
What causing it?  The food I eat?

DOCTOR X572
The food you eat, the cholesterol you have, high blood pressure, all those things combined.

PATIENT X572
Blocks the heart.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT X572
Exercise don't help?

DOCTOR X572
It does help but it doesn't take away all the other problems.

PATIENT X572
Hmm.  Okay.

DOCTOR X572
It builds up over time.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
So you've stopped drinking all together?

PATIENT X572
Yeah.

DOCTOR X572
Wow, that's very good.

PATIENT X572
Well I'd say coming from me that is good.

DOCTOR X572
When was your last drink?

PATIENT X572
About two months ago.

DOCTOR X572
You didn't have any problems trying to go back to the bottle or wanting to drink more?

PATIENT X572
Hmm.  I tell you what, I don't want any more, cause I quit drinking before.

DOCTOR X572
Good, good.

PATIENT X572
@@@.

DOCTOR X572
Cause the liver, it's gonna cause you a lot of trouble.

PATIENT X572
Cause that's @@@ when I worked.

DOCTOR X572
Okay and you're not working?

PATIENT X572

PATIENT X572
Yes.

DOCTOR X572
How many stairs do you go up at night?

PATIENT X572
I go up two flights.

DOCTOR X572
Do you have any problems with chest pain?

PATIENT X572
Sometimes shortness of breath, sometimes pain you know, it stops me, I get dizzy, lightheaded.

DOCTOR X572
Do you ever have that situation?

PATIENT X572
I think that my blood pressure.  Do you get dizzy.

DOCTOR X572
Uh this also could be from the heart.

PATIENT X572
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X572
The blood pressure has to be really low to give you those symptoms.

PATIENT X572
To make you dizzy?

DOCTOR X572
Yeah.

PATIENT X572
My blood pressure is high.

DOCTOR X572
Exactly, I don't know if that's it.

PATIENT X572
Yeah.  But if I exercise or over exercise I get dizzy.

DOCTOR X572
Okay.

PATIENT X572
And I get dizzy and I stop.

DOCTOR X572
Do you have it every time you go up the stairs?

PATIENT X572
Not all the time, just if I over do it you know.

DOCTOR X572
Now since they put that stent in your heart, has it become less frequent?  Do you notice you're doing better since then or is it the same?

PATIENT X572
Just normal, I don't know.  I get the dizziness sometimes after @@@.  

DOCTOR X572
Alright.  What other questions do you have for me today?

PATIENT X572

DOCTOR X572

PATIENT X572
Yeah I don't have to go to the bathroom frequently.

DOCTOR X572

PATIENT X572
That's what I'm trying to do.

DOCTOR X572
Do you need to pick up the forms for that?

PATIENT X572
I went to Social Security @@@ to try and get that.

DOCTOR X572
What did they say?

PATIENT X572
I got to get records from here.

DOCTOR X572
So if you go to the Business Medical Office they give you all your records I think it's the Regional Office just across the street.

PATIENT X572

DOCTOR X572
Right and they can give you all the stuff to take to Social Security.  Okay.  And if you questions you can always come back and ask me how I can help.

SECOND PERSON X572

PATIENT X572

SECOND PERSON X572

SECOND PERSON X572

DOCTOR X572
Alright listen.  I'll explain it to you like this; you can watch these football games while you have beers.

PATIENT X572
I ain't worried about that.

DOCTOR X572
But you'll probably watch footballs for a couple more years.

PATIENT X572
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X572
Alright. 

PATIENT X572
I'm not gonna get too worried.

DOCTOR X572
Or you can watch 20 years of football games without the beer.

PATIENT X572
Without a beer okay.

SECOND PERSON X572

DOCTOR X572
Just want to do that.

PATIENT X572

DOCTOR X572
Alright @@@.

PATIENT X572
@@@ grand champ Indianapolis man.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah you have to @@@.

PATIENT X572

SECOND PERSON X572
You're very confident when we were talking about NFL @@@.  I don't know if that's changed here.

DOCTOR X572
It goes with @@@.

SECOND PERSON X572
Yeah I guess.

PATIENT X572
Right I mean.

DOCTOR X572
Alright she was telling me you're gonna look into getting disability and uh so @@@ good and then we talked last time what is your combat history?  

PATIENT X572
Artillery, artillery.

DOCTOR X572
Where were you at?

PATIENT X572
Vietnam, Germany.  Do I need to document it?

DOCTOR X572
No that's fine.

PATIENT X572
Munich, @@@ the whole of Germany.

DOCTOR X572
And you were in Vietnam.

PATIENT X572
Oh man @@@ I saw some awful stuff; I got into some of the action.

SECOND PERSON X572
Yeah he did.

PATIENT X572
I @@@ we were digging holes laying in the ground.

SECOND PERSON X572
Wow.

PATIENT X572
@@@.

DOCTOR X572
The reason why I was asking you was I was wanting to know if any of that stuff with you wanting to drink and stuff like that.  Do you ever have flashbacks?

PATIENT X572
Oh plenty of them yeah, plenty of them.

DOCTOR X572
@@@.

PATIENT X572
I remember all that stuff.  @@@ about that.  All that stuff in Vietnam.

DOCTOR X572
What do you think about your old days of partying and the fact that now you're 59 and you have blockages in your heart and a bad liver.

PATIENT X572
I still want to party you know.

DOCTOR X572
You probably can't.

PATIENT X572
I still want to party.

DOCTOR X572
You understand that right?

PATIENT X572
@@@.  Yeah I still going around peaking at parties you know and what's been going on, man I'm giving it a little break, that's mainly the conversation.  That's @@@ alright.  I'm not doing it right now.

DOCTOR X572
Did you get your colonoscopy here yet?

PATIENT X572
Is that where they put you in the MIR @@@.

DOCTOR X572
Uh MRI.

PATIENT X572
MRI.

DOCTOR X572
No the colonoscopy is the one where.

PATIENT X572
You get to drink all this stuff.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah.

PATIENT X572
Yeah I did that yeah.

DOCTOR X572
But they put you on the schedule but I don't think they did it did they?

PATIENT X572
Yeah they did it.

DOCTOR X572
When?

PATIENT X572
I think it was a colonoscopy?  They put me in a MRI and.

DOCTOR X572
No.

PATIENT X572
I drank a lot of stuff.

DOCTOR X572
Oh that's something different yeah.

PATIENT X572
PET, @@@ on the first floor.

DOCTOR X572
No that's another one, that's something different.  The colonoscopy is they make a drink a prep overnight that makes you poop all night long cleans out your entire bowels and then they put you to sleep while they put a camera in your rectum and they look for cancers in your intestines.  You have not had that.  I think people remember that.

PATIENT X572
Yeah.

DOCTOR X572
@@@.  I think they talked to you about it in the GI and explained to you that the reason why they want to do it is uh everyone is supposed to have one at the age of 50 okay.  It's a screening for colon cancer.

PATIENT X572
Right.

DOCTOR X572
And the reason why we do it is because colon cancer is one of the few cancers that if you catch it, while it's still like a little small couple of cells that are growing in your intestines we can see we cut it out and its gone and we just have to do a follow-up test later.  If we don't look for it, we don't catch it and it becomes a cancer and grows into the stomach, goes through the walls of the colon, just through the walls of the colon and then it goes to other places.  Once it spreads past the colon.

PATIENT X572
What does the colon do anyhow?

DOCTOR X572
The colon is the large intestines, that's all it is.

PATIENT X572
Hmm.

DOCTOR X572
The large intestines.

PATIENT X572
Pancreas.

DOCTOR X572
Pancreas is different.  That helps you digest food.  The colon helps you pass the food out and makes stool but that's the second highest form of cancer Americans get.

PATIENT X572
Hmm.

DOCTOR X572
Okay.  The only thing more than that is lung cancer.  

PATIENT X572
Yes.

DOCTOR X572
But the colon cancer is the only one we can actually look at, cut out and stop it before it becomes a cancer.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
So they wanted to do it but then they got worried that you were on that blood thinner.

PATIENT X572
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR X572
So now that you've stopped it, I think we should probably have you go back and get that done, what do you think?

PATIENT X572
Yes.

DOCTOR X572
You'll go for it?

PATIENT X572
Yes.  In order to get a lot of years.  I love my Sci Fi.  @@@.  You know what I'm talking about.

DOCTOR X572
What happened outside?

SECOND PERSON X572
@@@.

PATIENT X572
@@@.  Flash Gordon, @@@.  Doctor Who.

DOCTOR X572
@@@.  Um your blood pressure's better um but we need to get it even lower by you know the next time you come.

PATIENT X572
Will I still be breathing?

DOCTOR X572
Well do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?

PATIENT X572
No.

DOCTOR X572
Do you want to pick up one today so that we can actually have you check your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT X572
I can check my own blood pressure?

DOCTOR X572
Yeah you can put a cuff on your arm, press the button and the machine reads it up to you.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
And that way, actually bring it when you come in.

PATIENT X572
So what happens if it's too high or too low?

DOCTOR X572
I want you to write it down.

PATIENT X572
Call 911.

DOCTOR X572
No.  I want you to write them down and the next time you come see me bring in the sheet of the blood pressures you wrote down.

PATIENT X572
I take the blood every day?

DOCTOR X572
One in the morning and one in the evening.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
So it's like two weeks and then write them down and bring them in.  Cause if something like you know if your blood pressure's like 140/90 that's not good enough but you're like but here it shows every day I'm 120/80 at home, maybe I just don't like you and that's why my blood pressure goes up.  We'll leave it at that and we won't change your medications.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
But if you continue to be high then we need to change it.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
The same thing, when you come to see, we'll reschedule the Pharmacy visit.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
When you come in to see the pharmacist uh.

PATIENT X572
You going to reschedule that for me?

DOCTOR X572
Yeah, so when you come in to see her, she can actually even look at the blood pressure medications, blood pressures and decide what we need to give you.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
And she'll just put it under my name.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
So why don't we pick up a blood pressure cuff today.

PATIENT X572
I can get that today.

DOCTOR X572
Yeah and then once we get that going, for the next two weeks write down your blood pressures and we'll move your Pharmacy visit back two weeks.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
Sound okay.

PATIENT X572
Okay.

DOCTOR X572
Um now let me try to remember where you get your blood pressure.

PATIENT X572
What about my cholesterol?  We didn't say anything about that, the results of the blood test.  I took about 100 gallon of blood for a while.

DOCTOR X572
@@@.

PATIENT X572
Hey.

DOCTOR X572

PATIENT X572
Hmm.

DOCTOR X572

PATIENT X572

SECOND PERSON X572
Yeah and it's warm out there.  How many more layers do you put on when you're cold?

PATIENT X572

PATIENT X572

DOCTOR X572

SECOND PERSON X572

PATIENT X572
They deliver, @@@.

DOCTOR X572

PATIENT X572
Like there's no food.

DOCTOR X572
Your cholesterol is actually good.  You have a very good cholesterol number so that was in September so they're gonna change it.  That's the one thing you did right, I don't know.  Probably the alcohol but.

PATIENT X572

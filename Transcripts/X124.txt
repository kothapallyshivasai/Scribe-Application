DOCTOR X124
They did see you.

PATIENT X124
Yes.

DOCTOR X124

PATIENT X124
I had been passing a little bit of blood in the urine so they did a cystoscopy.

DOCTOR X124

PATIENT X124
And at the same time he uh did a scan of the pelvic area and discovered a small aneurysm on the renal right kidney renal artery.

DOCTOR X124
What side?

PATIENT X124
I had a PSA test which was good and a digital exam which was fine.

DOCTOR X124
Okay.

PATIENT X124
And uh in February visited the cardiologist.  Cholesterol was about 207.

DOCTOR X124
Good.

PATIENT X124
He said it should be down a little bit but not bad.

DOCTOR X124
Was that the bad cholesterol or the total cholesterol do you know?

PATIENT X124
Uh the basic cholesterol.  Yeah I don't have other numbers.

DOCTOR X124
So it was almost 200.  Uh your number for the cholesterol.

PATIENT X124
About 207.

DOCTOR X124
Okay.

PATIENT X124
Blood pressure I get that checked every month when I go for a walk at the shopping mall and the team from the hospital there they checked us and it's right within nice limits.

DOCTOR X124
Okay.  Any other problems at all?

PATIENT X124
I go to a dermatologist about every six months uh to have the.  They found something on the tip of my ear here and he removed it.  It was squamous cell carcinoma.  All these years working out in the sun as a carpenter.

DOCTOR X124
Right, yeah.

PATIENT X124
It did the damage.

DOCTOR X124
So did they do anything or they just removed it?

PATIENT X124
They removed it and sent it in for pathology.

DOCTOR X124

PATIENT X124
And he said to come back every six months and look it over.

DOCTOR X124

DOCTOR X124
I'll probably check everything except your cholesterol again cause that one you have to be fasting.

DOCTOR X124
Which aneurysm?

PATIENT X124
It was on the right kidney renal artery.

DOCTOR X124
Did the urologist say anything at all?

PATIENT X124
That's where they first discovered it when they did the scan.

DOCTOR X124
Yeah.

PATIENT X124
And then the cardiologist mentioned it too but he didn't say what would be done if anything.  I have an appointment soon with a general practitioner too.

DOCTOR X124

DOCTOR X124
Okay.  Okay let me talk to my attending I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:44  DOCTOR IN:  71:10)

DOCTOR X124
Okay, so these okay let me see.  Have you filled the Lipitor for a while, I haven't changed the dose, do you know?

PATIENT X124
Uh I am due for renewal of the prescriptions at some point.

DOCTOR X124
Okay, but I mean have you changed the dose recently?

PATIENT X124
No.

DOCTOR X124
Okay.  So I have a couple of questions.  We need to check lab work before I can refills your medicines.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
You know, what I can do, there's a couple of options.  So one thing is we can check most of the labs today um.

PATIENT X124
How much what?

DOCTOR X124
We could check most of the lab work today.

PATIENT X124
Oh okay yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X124
So that would make all the meds okay except for the Lipitor.

PATIENT X124
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X124
You know, so we have a couple of options.  I could either check all the labs today and redo all of your medications through here except for the Lipitor.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
And then I'd either need the records of fasting lipids you know the cholesterol.

PATIENT X124
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X124
Or have you come back and do the fasting lab before I give you the Lipitor.

PATIENT X124
Oh I see yeah.

DOCTOR X124
Or we could just hold off and have you come back in a week or so and get all the lab work done and then I could renew all the medicines.

PATIENT X124
Sure.

DOCTOR X124
Which one works better for you?

PATIENT X124
Yeah why don't I wait and give you the result.

DOCTOR X124
Well what we could do is we could check all the lab work today.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
Then I could refill all the meds except for the Lipitor.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
Then I could just give you the fax number and you could fax over the.

PATIENT X124
Sure.

DOCTOR X124
Your cholesterol and then we could give you the Lipitor and see how it goes.

PATIENT X124
Okay that'll work fine.

DOCTOR X124
Okay.  Um, let's see here.  I'll have them do the labs @@@.  Um so one thing is, we don't have that exact one but have an equivalent.

PATIENT X124
Is that lisinopril?

DOCTOR X124
Lisinopril.

PATIENT X124
Yeah that's what I've been getting.

DOCTOR X124
Okay.  Cause that @@@.

PATIENT X124
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X124
I'm pretty sure.

PATIENT X124
I know all of them have two or three or four names.

DOCTOR X124
Right.  Um, @@@ is like, I mean it's in the same class.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
So I added the lisinopril 2.5.

PATIENT X124
Okay it's up to you whatever.

DOCTOR X124
It's equivalent.

PATIENT X124
Yeah whatever gets the job done.

DOCTOR X124
Let me see, lisinopril.  (Doctor working on computer)  Okay lisinopril, the Plavix, the aspirin, Fosamax, Synthroid, the lisinopril and metoprolol @@@.  So today we'll do the lab work they'll do electrolytes, your lipids and thyroid.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
Okay so we'll get the lab work today up here.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
And then um, I'll have to give you the fax number out front um that way, we need to look at the cholesterol if you'll just fax it.  I'll have you fax it over here.

PATIENT X124
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X124
Um, otherwise you know, just have you come back next year.

PATIENT X124
Yeah.

DOCTOR X124
Okay but if some of the other clinics are closer to you, if you'd like transfer over there.

PATIENT X124
Sure.

DOCTOR X124
No problem and then um you know once I get the @@@ of the cholesterol I'll renew the Lipitor.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
Okay and oh yeah so when you come back, if do a lot of lab work from outside doctors.

PATIENT X124
Yeah.

DOCTOR X124
And you don't want to repeat it, just the next time you get the lab work always get a paper copy for yourself.

PATIENT X124
Okay.

DOCTOR X124
And when you bring it in.

PATIENT X124
Yeah.

DOCTOR X124
As long as you have records of some lab work.

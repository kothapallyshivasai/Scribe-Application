Yeah that's what I see there.  Do you check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X618
No.

DOCTOR X618
No.  Do you want a cuff?

PATIENT X618
Yeah.  I think the blood pressure's medication is working this time.

DOCTOR X618
It seems like it is, it really does.

PATIENT X618
Yeah.  Every time I come in it seems to work.  I'm good there.

DOCTOR X618
Okay uh let's see, @@@ I want to make sure.  Um are you still smoking?  Yeah you probably @@@.

PATIENT X618
Well I will, yeah but I'm trying to quit so, which reminds me I.

DOCTOR X618
Huh?

PATIENT X618
Get some more of the gum.

DOCTOR X618
Okay yeah.

PATIENT X618
Uh do they have patches that uh?

DOCTOR X618
Yes. 

PATIENT X618
Let me try the gum one more time.

DOCTOR X618
Well you never know.  Here's the thing if you want to do patches you have to go to the Smoking Cessation Class.

PATIENT X618
That may be my next move if I don't.

DOCTOR X618
Well I mean, you don't necessarily have to make it your next move.  You can do that as your now move cause there's nothing wrong with it.

PATIENT X618
I'll try the gum; I'll the try the gum once.

DOCTOR X618
You'll try the gum, let me put it in.

PATIENT X618
Yeah please.

DOCTOR X618
Okay, I'll do that.  Have you been using the gum?

PATIENT X618
Well I quit for a week, that's the reason.  I wasn't using it cause I have some stress you know.

DOCTOR X618
Yeah sure.

PATIENT X618
You personalize just uh but uh I quit uh for a week and then, a little over a week ago but right now I'm at the point where I've started back up but I'm cutting it down, I want to quit then so.  I got, but they say it takes sometimes, it takes three times.

DOCTOR X618
I understand that yeah.

PATIENT X618
Oh I been smoking for 47 years.

DOCTOR X618
It's a bad habit.

PATIENT X618
Yeah.  Yeah @@@.  But I go to church all the time now.  I'm a born again Christian and I'm praying and everything.  I think I'm gonna make it hopefully.

DOCTOR X618
Let's see um.  I think I went up on your cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT X618
Uh I was gonna, I quit taking it.

DOCTOR X618
Oh why?

PATIENT X618
It seems like I was getting pain with it and uh the doctor uh, what's her name uh the chief doctor, what's her name?

DOCTOR X618
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X618
She changed the medication because I was feeling pain from the other one.

DOCTOR X618
Let's see which doctor?

PATIENT X618
What's her name right here?

DOCTOR X618
DOCTOR?

PATIENT X618
Yeah.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.  Let me see what's in her note right here.  She changed it to pravastatin okay.  The name is pravastatin.

PATIENT X618
I was getting @@@ down to one.  I've been pain a lot in the right shoulder.  I get pain in my shoulder.  @@@ get a cortisone shot every three months.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
And uh it seem like it just made it worse uh.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
So I quit and the shoulder felt a little better.

DOCTOR X618
So is it pain in your shoulder or pain in the muscles?

PATIENT X618
It's hard to tell the difference.  I think it's the muscle.

DOCTOR X618
When you have pain you're doing what?  @@@.

PATIENT X618
Shoulder and.

DOCTOR X618
Right here.

PATIENT X618
Seems like it's always in the muscle too and uh I quit taking it.  I'm overdue for my steroid shot but their backlogged up there so what I was you know, doing myself was that I got an appointment for up there but it's late cause they're stacked up.  I wanted to get my shot once again and then start taking that medication again and see if there is a difference because it was like @@@.  I still have problems but @@@.

DOCTOR X618
Is it a sharp pain when you move your arm?

PATIENT X618
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X618
And if you're not moving it, how is it, is it better?

PATIENT X618
I'm okay right now but if I move it.

DOCTOR X618
It's, I mean keep going.

PATIENT X618
You can hear it snap at times.

DOCTOR X618
When you were on the medicine for your cholesterol was it bad when you were moving?

PATIENT X618
It was bad when I wasn't moving nowhere.  If I remember correctly.  I got so many things in my mind that I try to remember.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
I don't like taking pills.

DOCTOR X618
No, no I understand, no that's fine.  Um.  Do you know when you have an appointment for that?

PATIENT X618
Uh next month, I'm not sure exactly of the date.  I've got it at home but I got it next month.

DOCTOR X618
Cause I think.

PATIENT X618
Probably within the month.

DOCTOR X618
Yeah.  The way you talk, do you think its degenerative change problems, @@@.

PATIENT X618
I'm gonna get @@@ a vascular thing more.

DOCTOR X618
Okay, @@@ what the ultimate problem is.  Because you know how though, someone would let you know shoulder joints work for a while oh I mean injections work but they're temporary measures.  They don't uh.

PATIENT X618
Well I just, I just keep hearing a popping.

DOCTOR X618
Oh right, right.

PATIENT X618
And I'm just wondering if maybe my shoulder is uh.

DOCTOR X618
You know we could have you do physical therapy.

PATIENT X618
I like the physical therapy for a while but not actually for my shoulder for my back I mean.

DOCTOR X618
But let's see.

PATIENT X618
@@@.

DOCTOR X618
Oh because what I'm saying a lot of times one of the best ways of getting things better is working around that joint.

PATIENT X618
Oh.

DOCTOR X618
Getting the muscle either more loose and strengthen around the joint.

PATIENT X618
Oh.

DOCTOR X618
That not only helps the joint but it helps to support the structures.

PATIENT X618
Yeah.

DOCTOR X618
And a lot of times you'll see improvement that way.

PATIENT X618
Oh.

DOCTOR X618
@@@.

PATIENT X618
I was @@@.

DOCTOR X618
Good.  Way back in 2010 right, was that when it was 2010?

PATIENT X618
I can't remember.  Sometimes I @@@.

DOCTOR X618
Have you had any work-up @@@.

PATIENT X618
No but I.

DOCTOR X618
You don't have any MRIs for this.

PATIENT X618
No.  I just had an MRI on my back, @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X618
Yeah let me see.  Oh I was looking at your x-rays; you've got a bony spur in there.

PATIENT X618
I think I got to discuss with them a little bit further this time.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
Because you know I think I tore my rotator cuff a long time ago and uh I don't know what's wrong with it now.  Just like came on all of a sudden and it snaps and pops.  I sometimes, I have a feeling; I got to ask them, if it's dislocated or something.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.  Yeah it's probably not dislocated.  You'd really know it if it was dislocated.

PATIENT X618
Oh I'm telling you at times I really feel it.

DOCTOR X618
Where, we'll take a look.  I mean it would look like this.  @@@ you don't look @@@.

PATIENT X618
Oh okay.  Alright.

DOCTOR X618
That's @@@.

PATIENT X618
Okay, okay.  Then I'm not dislocated but sometimes I get a real bad pain and if I move it suddenly I get a sharp pain like ah.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
Like I said I'm gonna talk to them more.  I guess that's what they specialize in so.

DOCTOR X618
Yeah they do that all the time.

PATIENT X618
@@@.

DOCTOR X618
Let's see, @@@.  They weren't gonna to do a colonoscopy for you but it looks like we're gonna do maybe the blood tests for your stool.

PATIENT X618
Right, you know what.

DOCTOR X618
Did you pick those up, they look like it.

PATIENT X618
Well I did pick them up.

DOCTOR X618
Okay so you did get them.

PATIENT X618
But I don't, it looks like @@@ I lost it.  

DOCTOR X618
Yeah we'll see.

PATIENT X618
Oh okay.  Yeah I was gonna ask you about that. @@@.  And I wanted to ask uh.

DOCTOR X618
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X618
Uh DOCTOR sent me for an x-ray on my spine in order to get service-connected disability with my back.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
And uh I don't know if it's the muscle or the disability.  Sometimes I see these doctors and I forgot what they said.  All I know is @@@ something like that.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
But uh.  I was at xxx xxx before I started coming to the VA.  I think I had one of the spine and I got arthritis or some kind of thing @@@.

DOCTOR X618
Let's see, I see.  @@@.  All I see is um a CT of your, looks like it's right here from November 2010.  Did you get anything; you got something done somewhere else?

PATIENT X618
Uh no, nowhere else.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.  Well we actually @@@ six months ago.  They did a CT of your neck and it showed some degenerative changes.

PATIENT X618
When was the last time I was here, do you know?

DOCTOR X618
Okay I'll check it.

PATIENT X618
Uh well I had that done since the last time I was here.

DOCTOR X618
@@@.

PATIENT X618
Yeah.

DOCTOR X618
Um, you did, did you do an MRI?

PATIENT X618
Uh I did that at xxx.

DOCTOR X618
Well let me actually see.

PATIENT X618
But now I didn't have the spine x-ray at xxx, I believe that was here.

DOCTOR X618
So let's see.  

PATIENT X618
It's @@@.

DOCTOR X618
There you go, wait, what?  They did an MRI of your brain?

PATIENT X618
I had uh yes.

DOCTOR X618
What was the ultimate reason for?

PATIENT X618
Well it started out uh a while back, like two doctors ago.  Some guy thought I might have been having a heart attack cause my left eye went numb.  Instead they sent me, they checked me out and no heart attack but they sent me for a CAT scan and uh but that's gone, I don't know I guess it came out okay.

DOCTOR X618
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X618
And see why they tell me, she thought that maybe I might have had a stroke, so she scheduled me for an MRI, I couldn't do it because I'm claustrophobic at xxx.  They outsourced me even and they couldn't get it and this time they gave me some medication and I went to xxx and I did it and everything was alright except that I got an enlarged blood vessel but it's not a, oh what do you call uh, uh.

DOCTOR X618
Probably aneurysm.

PATIENT X618
Right they said it wasn't an aneurysm.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
And she said uh that my sinuses, I got an infection in my sinuses.  

DOCTOR X618
@@@.

PATIENT X618
So.  And I was just happy it wasn't a stroke or whatever.  But didn't say about the medication.  You know I took two pills and the nasal spray.

DOCTOR X618
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X618
I take them it seems like my nose just keeps running and running and running.

DOCTOR X618
Yeah.

PATIENT X618
So I stopped that too and my nose doesn't run and uh.  When I joined the service uh they said I had postnasal drip @@@.  But it runs in my family.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.  Yeah I'll be honest with you, there are a couple of things which really help that, might make a difference @@@.  

PATIENT X618
Yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X618
@@@.  To be honest with you uh it really is.

PATIENT X618
I know, I'm trying.  I know I want to stop more.  I got emphysema @@@.

DOCTOR X618
Are you taking your inhalers at all?

PATIENT X618
Yeah I use that uh, the Combivent.

DOCTOR X618
Yeah.

PATIENT X618
No, no what's.

DOCTOR X618
The albuterol inhaler.

PATIENT X618
Albuterol.

DOCTOR X618
Sorry.

PATIENT X618

DOCTOR X618
Mail it to you?

PATIENT X618
Yeah.

DOCTOR X618
Okay. 

PATIENT X618
Right, right.  Especially my refills for the pain and the muscle relaxant.

DOCTOR X618
You're taking Vicodin right?

PATIENT X618
Right, right.  Because like I haven't.

DOCTOR X618
Are you taking the inhaled steroids too?

PATIENT X618
Uh I quit that.  I'm trying to.

DOCTOR X618
It looks um like @@@.

PATIENT X618
Uh methocarbamol.

DOCTOR X618
Right there we go.

PATIENT X618
Yeah I want to stay up to date on that because I came down to the wire not long ago and thought oh man I'm gonna be in pain if I and I called DOCTOR and I got a prescription @@@.  Cause I don't want to hurt.

DOCTOR X618
Right, yeah that's no problem.  

PATIENT X618
Maybe if she lived with me it would bother her.  Now when did I take @@@.

DOCTOR X618
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X618
Uh when I pick up that thing for the stool where do they.

DOCTOR X618
At the Lab.

PATIENT X618
Where I get my blood pressure taken?

DOCTOR X618
It's on the other side of the hall, where you get your blood drawn.

PATIENT X618
I went there and they didn't give it to me, they told me to come over here.

DOCTOR X618
They did huh.

PATIENT X618
Yeah.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.  I thought that was where they, maybe that's where you drop them off.  I thought it was over there.

PATIENT X618
I think you drop them off there too but I don't.

DOCTOR X618
@@@.  Alright we'll ask if they have them.

PATIENT X618
Okay.

DOCTOR X618

DOCTOR X618
You want to go back and see the Rehab doctors?  The PT folks to start doing those again or?

PATIENT X618
No what I want to do is I want to see the doctor first and then I'll make you know the decision.

DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
Yeah I believe so.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Yeah, okay.

PATIENT X618
I stopped taking it and I got an appointment like at the beginning of next month.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
I'm seeing them again.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
You're seeing them again okay.

PATIENT X618
But uh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
You know it's hard and you have a lot of risk factors.  You know sometimes I have patients come and say yeah you now you're really sick and I really think that's alright for you to @@@ and then they come back a couple months later with a heart attack so I don't want you to.

PATIENT X618
Oh and you're gonna give me a heart attack now.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Yeah.  @@@ sometimes because @@@ you know you have a lot of things going against you.  The smoking.

PATIENT X618
Yeah I understand but at the time I'd be in such pain you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Yeah.

PATIENT X618
You told me that.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
I mean I don't want you to take your medicines, I just want to make sure is that really the problem though.

PATIENT X618
Well I'm that's what I want to determine.  I'm waiting to get in up there again and get a shot.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X618
And then I was gonna start taking that again and see.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
How, what happens.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
You know then if you want to restart it, you could restart it again.

PATIENT X618
No not now.  Not till after I have that shot.  I'm telling you.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X618
It's very painful.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
I mean I understand the risks I'm taking.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
But uh it comes down to you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Well right now you have a lot of pain uh is it only when you do certain things?

PATIENT X618
When I do certain things.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay when you take the pills, even at rest you're in pain is that correct?

PATIENT X618
Uh most of the time it seems yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X618
But I'm going to find out myself.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
Cause I'm going to see that doctor again.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X618
And I'm going to get a shot, hopefully I got.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
I'm gonna talk to him and after that I will resume taking that.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Okay.

PATIENT X618
Cause I may have to find out for myself.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Yeah okay.  Um there's a couple of other statins that if that is the problem we can try another statin.  There are probably other peoples, @@@ problems with all of them unfortunately.

PATIENT X618
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Um and now we, have you decided about it, you remember that we.

PATIENT X618
Yeah we were going to discuss that, do you remember, we haven't discussed that.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Well I filled in the form they said.

PATIENT X618
I know and I told you we'll talk about that next time I come in.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Yeah that's why I'm here to talk to you.

PATIENT X618
Yeah okay, we're talking.  What is it?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
So this is one of the veins seemed a little bit enlarged in the head um one of the veins.  Now we all have um.

PATIENT X618
Right, right, right.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Sinuses.

PATIENT X618
Now what is this thing called?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
A brain MRI.  It's called MRE, which is the same thing as having @@@ injection of the die.

PATIENT X618
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
It's a different kind of picture exactly.

PATIENT X618
It's the same thing basically as a MRI.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
MRI.

PATIENT X618
Wonderful.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Can you go @@@?

PATIENT X618
What if I don't I mean, what's the?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Well um the thing is um you know we just want to make sure it's not like an aneurysm.  Oh @@@ um.

PATIENT X618
I thought you said it wasn't.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
It's not an aneurysm because it's not coming from the artery @@@.

PATIENT X618
Well it already showed that it's enlarged.  I mean what difference does it make of having it done or not?  MRE or V or whatever it is.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Uh no @@@.  Um.

PATIENT X618
It just seems like I've been getting a whole lot of x-rays and stuff you know.  I shut out the light here and we can still see you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
No, no.

PATIENT X618
Cause I glow in the dark.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
The thing is sometimes the @@@ get thrombosed, you know they can @@@ you know they get enlarged and they're bigger than usual and then blood tends to thicken there and they can form clots and then you end up with a different set of problems and @@@.

PATIENT X618
Okay and uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
And uh it could potentially cause a stroke because.

PATIENT X618
Okay, what if I get the MRE and what is it going to show different?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
So if it does show that you have uh a enlarged vein.

PATIENT X618
Okay then what do you do?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Unless you have thrombosis, more blood clots, we leave it alone and then just so there isn't any blood clot then you have to be on blood thinners.

PATIENT X618
Oh boy.  It seems like I get a lot of x-rays and stuff.  They all don’t seem necessary.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
You know the problem is unfortunately @@@ right now, we get inside of the part of the head now and you have to follow up on it because now there is something @@@.

PATIENT X618
@@@.  One test uh, I just had that for one thing.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
And they found something else.

PATIENT X618
And the test shows up something different and then when it shows up something different I get a test for that and that shows up something different.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
@@@.

PATIENT X618
And it's going on and on and on.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
I know.  It's because @@@ so intense, @@@.

PATIENT X618
When do we finally say okay that's enough?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Uh we yeah the patient dies or when he says no I don't want it @@@ because from our side of view we had to offer it and.

PATIENT X618
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X618
Just so we can get some answers.  So.

PATIENT X618
Where do I have this at?  xxx again?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
xxx xxx again.

PATIENT X618
And it's the same steps huh?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
They do the same thing.  They just to a focus on the veins this time, not on the.

PATIENT X618
Is it the same machine, very same?

SECOND DOCTOR X618
The same machine yeah that's right @@@.

PATIENT X618
I think they injected me the last time didn't they?

SECOND DOCTOR X618

DOCTOR X87
Not that long ago.

PATIENT X87
Okay.

DOCTOR X87
They were fine.

PATIENT X87
Okay.  So uh-huh.

DOCTOR X87
I'm not sure what the issue was with that.

PATIENT X87
Um cause I just had, I had oral surgery at the VA Hospital.  You know I was telling the nurse @@@ how.

DOCTOR X87
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X87
How bridge broke, that's why I got a flip in my mouth now.

DOCTOR X87
Where'd you go xxx Brown or?

PATIENT X87
Yeah, yeah they did it at xxx Brown but they don't do implants.  @@@ last month.

DOCTOR X87
Oh yeah.  Okay.

PATIENT X87
This is about the second week now I've been out of surgery so I got to go back the end of this month so they can do pictures and then cause I had a bone graft also.

DOCTOR X87
Sure.

PATIENT X87
Uh-huh.  And they was telling me then my kidneys cause you know they had to prep me for surgery.

DOCTOR X87
They were telling the kidneys.

PATIENT X87
And yeah one of the uh, uh anesthesiologists, she looked in the computer after I did my lab work at xxx Brown, she said your kidneys is just a little bit over the functioning levels, just a little bit over and I said well I'm going to have to talk to my general medicine doctor and see if there's some medicine they got I need to take.

DOCTOR X87
Well let's see, I'm going to look over at xxx Brown and see what they're talking about.

PATIENT X87
Okay.

DOCTOR X87
So you just had a bunch of lab tests today.

PATIENT X87
Yeah, yeah, so see I missed my first operation that they scheduled me.  It was back during October or November because my church was doing a rehearsal to do our Christmas concert.

DOCTOR X87
Oh yeah I remember you telling me that.

PATIENT X87
Yeah and so I couldn't do the surgery so after the concert in December they had me scheduled and they did it.

DOCTOR X87
And it's very; I don't think it's a big deal.

PATIENT X87
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X87
They're telling you, it's very slight.

PATIENT X87
Okay.

DOCTOR X87
Yeah so I think they're kind of making a little bit more out of it than what it actually is.

PATIENT X87
Oh okay, I was worried.

DOCTOR X87
You they don't know you know better so.

PATIENT X87
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X87
Don't worry about all that.

PATIENT X87
So I don't need to worry about this.

DOCTOR X87
Yeah, I mean as long as we control your blood pressure.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.

DOCTOR X87
It should be fine.

PATIENT X87
Okay doctor.

DOCTOR X87
And it's almost the same as it was when we checked it.

PATIENT X87
Okay.

DOCTOR X87
Maybe a touch higher but.

PATIENT X87
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X87
It's not that.

PATIENT X87
Not some degree, major cause I was under the impression my kidney was getting ready to shut down on me.

DOCTOR X87
No, no, no, no.

PATIENT X87
And I was going to end up being on dialysis.

DOCTOR X87
No, no, no.

PATIENT X87
I'm glad to hear that man.

DOCTOR X87
No it's not that bad.

PATIENT X87
Yeah cause I'm having a lot of problem.  My major problem now is my eyes.

DOCTOR X87
Yeah you don't.

PATIENT X87
Yeah see right now I have a flap and I missed my appointment yesterday but see the thing is I'm going to a different doctor to treat me for my uveitis in the eye and he's treating me for the glaucoma.

DOCTOR X87
Okay.

PATIENT X87
And I keep getting flyers.

DOCTOR X87
Do you see a DOCTOR?

PATIENT X87
Yeah, yeah DOCTOR is the surgeon.  I just started seeing him and he's a surgeon so I know they getting ready to operate and I can't see out.

DOCTOR X87
Are you doing whatever eye drops they're telling you to use?

PATIENT X87
Yeah, yeah I'm using that but the thing is my pressure still be elevated and then I'm becoming far-sighted.

DOCTOR X87
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X87
You know, every time I do that, what is that called way front you know where they have you look and then get your eyes adjusted and it be clear.

DOCTOR X87
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X87
But it always be blurry and then when I read, I'm farsighted.  Farsighted, I really can't see out of this eye now.  I can't see past 50 feet.  And then now it's beginning to happen with my left eye and my left eye is my good eye so I'm wondering what's going on and then well now, last time I seen the private doctor for my uveitis he had gave me a prescription for bifocal glasses.

DOCTOR X87
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X87
And then after about two or three appointments here I went back to him and he said all of a sudden I got a lens problem, the bifocal glasses won't help me.  So he had to get me, so I had new reading glasses.

DOCTOR X87
Hmm.

PATIENT X87
I said what happened and he say I have a lens problem now and I said well when did that develop and he say glasses won't help me with my farsightedness.

DOCTOR X87
Hmm.

PATIENT X87
Yeah man it's weird.

DOCTOR X87
Can you see him today or?

PATIENT X87
Well I scheduled to see him uh next month.  My appointment is. 

DOCTOR X87
April 15th.

PATIENT X87
Yeah April, uh-huh cause I called in and rescheduled and I was just so busy cause my wife @@@ when I needed my wife came in, I had to bring her in, uh because she did a biopsy the last time she was here and I had to bring her in last week and they had to go in and get some more of the tissue because they said it may be cancerous.

DOCTOR X87
What kind of a?

PATIENT X87
She has and so she had surgery on the fourth floor in the fourth floor, I brought her in the other day and that's when I came down here and made them find out when was my appointment was to see you.

DOCTOR X87
Okay.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.  Since I was wondering when my appointment was cause I know I needed to talk to you and my wife was having her surgery to see if they tissue, they had to go back into the side and take a lot of this tissue off to make sure they got it all so she was having cancer in a mole, uh-huh.  So she, then her car went out on her, she had a car went out on her.  The timing broke and then torqued the engine, I never heard of that.  They say Japanese made cars, if you don't change the timing belt in 60,000 miles it'll zap your car and you don't get, you out of the warranty.

DOCTOR X87
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X87
And I say well man, I said @@@ cars out there cause let them know when they bring in the car in when you get 60,000 miles, 
they said no that's their responsibility, they're supposed to read their manual.  I say oh man and she got to spend 4 grand on an engine man, just been paying on the car.

DOCTOR X87
Geez.

PATIENT X87
I tell you man it's always something.

DOCTOR X87
There's always something.  Are you taking aspirin still?

PATIENT X87
No I had to discontinue that because when they did the surgery and when I developed a coma.

DOCTOR X87
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X87
What it is the aspirin thins my blood and it ended up raising the pressure in my eye.

DOCTOR X87
Okay.

PATIENT X87
And they definitely told me I couldn't take it prior to that oral surgery.

DOCTOR X87
Yeah cause of surgery but otherwise did they tell you you shouldn't take it at all?

PATIENT X87
Yeah, yeah and I been having chest pain.

DOCTOR X87
Did you get that treadmill test done?

PATIENT X87
I sure had that test done, I sure did.

DOCTOR X87
Okay.

PATIENT X87
I did it at xxx Brown also.

DOCTOR X87
Oh you.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.

DOCTOR X87
Did you do it here as well?

PATIENT X87
I did it here and I did it at xxx Brown and I talked to the heart doctor up there.

DOCTOR X87
What did they say?

PATIENT X87
They wanted me to do the test again but xxx Brown ended up doing it prior to my cause I had to have the operation and instead of putting me on the treadmill, they didn't do the heart rate.

DOCTOR X87
Right.

PATIENT X87
You know how they give you an injection.

DOCTOR X87
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X87
And some man there and my heart is racing and they got me hooked up to the EKG machine and then when I got through my eyes was bloodshot red man.

DOCTOR X87
You're sure you even had this stress test in the last few months here?

PATIENT X87
Oh yeah it was a little farther back, a little farther back.

DOCTOR X87
But you saw this DOCTOR.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.

DOCTOR X87
In October and he ordered one.  Did you get that one?

PATIENT X87
He ordered one here but I ended up having it done at xxx Brown.

DOCTOR X87
Okay.  Okay, so you didn't have it done here.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.

DOCTOR X87
You had it at xxx Brown.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X87
So I'll see if we can find that at xxx Brown.

PATIENT X87
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X87
You said it was fine or?

PATIENT X87
Uh yeah, yeah because they say it was okay to have surgery.

DOCTOR X87
Okay.

PATIENT X87
You know.  The only thing I was concerned about is that my eyes turned red and then after I come out of surgery in Recovery the doctors knew my pressure was high, my blood pressure was high and my eyes were red again so I don't know if something has something to do with the @@@ pressure is up or something going on with my eyes again.  You know they noticed that they were bloodshot red going up.

DOCTOR X87
I never heard about not taking aspirin.  I mean I know for surgery.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.

DOCTOR X87
But not in general.

PATIENT X87
Oh they definitely said not to take it prior to surgery.

DOCTOR X87
I know for surgery but I'm not, I'm saying.

PATIENT X87
Yeah.

DOCTOR X87
Cause you have heart, you know what I mean you have heart problems.

PATIENT X87

PATIENT X87
Okay.

DOCTOR X87
In general, you have blockages in your arteries so.

PATIENT X87

DOCTOR X87
I mean I would.  I'm going to talk it over with my boss and see what @@@.

PATIENT X87
Okay if you want me to go back on them I take them.

DOCTOR X87

PATIENT X87
Yeah, yeah cause I have a heart murmur.

DOCTOR X87
Yeah.

PATIENT X87
I have a heart murmur and prior to exercising, walking on the treadmill, I get the chest pains and then all of a sudden once I get into my exercise it goes away yeah.

DOCTOR X87

PATIENT X87
Right, yeah, they did an injection.  To mimic the running on the treadmill.

DOCTOR X87
Right.

PATIENT X87

I know my wife was taking hormones and then her doctors made her take them when she started coming to the VA, made her stop taking them because they were messing with the women,  they were telling the women they were causing cancer.

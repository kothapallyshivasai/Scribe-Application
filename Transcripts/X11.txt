DOCTOR X11
PATIENT?  How ya doing?

PATIENT X11
Pretty well.

DOCTOR X11
Good to see you again, come on back.  I @@@.  So what's new?

PATIENT X11
I'm glad you asked.  I got a list.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
I uh, I had this Grover's disease for a couple of years now.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
It, it's not gone.  It's kind of in check uh still bugging me a little bit and, and the next thing.  When I take my cup of coffee in the morning and I lift it like this, my hand goes like this.

DOCTOR X11
Okay, that's new for you?

PATIENT X11
Well it's new in the last five or six months.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
Um and my, it doesn't have, you know any particular tremor but this is the one where I'm using several small muscles and when I get the coffee cup up to my, so I wanted to mention that to you.

DOCTOR X11
Is it just the one hand?

PATIENT X11
Well, I mean it's all I notice.  I, I don't feel any particular unease in my body.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
Or I'm not shaky going down stairs or anything like that.

DOCTOR X11
It's your right hand?

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
Are you right-handed?

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
You've never seen it in your left hand when you're doing stuff?

PATIENT X11
I tried on my left hand and uh, I, to a point it's similar but the place I, I first noticed it was my right hand.  @@@.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
So anyhow, I thought this might be a decent time to mention it.  It get, it's gotten a little bit more prominent in the last eh, you know as time goes along.

DOCTOR X11
And it doesn't happen all the time, just happens occasionally?

PATIENT X11
Just occasional.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
But I don't have any trouble putting keys in you know in a car or anything like that but.  Something else I noticed, I'm getting reflux.

DOCTOR X11
Okay what do you mean by reflux?

PATIENT X11
I get, if I, especially if I have something to eat after 7 o'clock at night.  I'll go to bed and I'm laying there and all of a sudden I get swallowing because the reflux, the gorge, the acid kind of a taste comes up through my trachea.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.  So you get like a strange taste in your mouth you're saying.

PATIENT X11
It's not a strange taste when it comes up, you just don't start swallowing junk.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
And so sometimes I get up and uh it's just really vile, go brush my teeth but that's happening, it probably happened eight or ten times in the last month.

DOCTOR X11
You've had this before too?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
In your chart did somebody mention that you've had this reflux before?  What would have done that, that notion?  You've never had an endoscopy that I've seen in our system.

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
@@@ no?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
But.

DOCTOR X11
Have you ever had medication for that though?

PATIENT X11
No, but you know my squeeze (NAME), takes, she has reflux and so she's had the endoscopy and the different things and so she's been treated for it and so that's what makes me think I just had too much to eat probably.  That's a big factor.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
You know I need a piece of pumpkin pie and ice cream at 8:30 at night like another hole in the head right?

DOCTOR X11
Uh, have you noticed certain foods that make it worse?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Do you know a food that typically makes it worse.

PATIENT X11
Yeah, I always eat Haagen Daz ice cream.  @@@.

DOCTOR X11
@@@ It's possible but it's just not in the literature to say Haagen Das ice cream.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Tobacco, caffeine.

PATIENT X11
I don't drink.  I mean I don't drink that I can remember.  I don't smoke, never.

DOCTOR X11
Alcohol?  Caffeine?

PATIENT X11
Uh.  

DOCTOR X11
You told me you're drinking tea right?  Coffee right?

PATIENT X11
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X11
Uh minty stuff, like stuff @@@.


PATIENT X11
Huh no.

DOCTOR X11
Um tomato and citrus stuff?

PATIENT X11
Maybe, I know I like pasta.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
And uh you know spaghetti and meatballs.

DOCTOR X11
Some people get it worse, if they eat spaghetti sauce they can tell right away, because they get bad reflux symptoms.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
And like you mentioned, it's classic.  If you eat right before you go to sleep, now that's the problem.  Then you lay flat and the stuff that you eat you're pushing it back into the esophagus.

PATIENT X11
Exactly.  And so it's almost like the hiccups, I mean here it comes. 

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
At 6 miles an hour.

DOCTOR X11
And it's not and it's not uh, you know it's not anything like, if you have it for a long time you get problems with changing of the cells that line your esophagus.

PATIENT X11
Okay.


DOCTOR X11
The cells that line the esophagus are a certain type of cell type and they're different than the ones in your stomach.  The ones in your stomach are used to the acidic environment.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
And if the esophagus gets exposed to this acid over and over, they start to change to resemble more of the ones in the stomach they got to cope with it.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
But as those cells change rapidly, there's a chance of developing cancer.  Something called xxx's esophagus.  If we see a change in the cell type of your esophagus that tells us that you now are getting close to reflux but now you're having change in the cells.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
That puts you at risk for esophageal cancer.  So it's nothing that we need to worry about now.  I'm just saying, you know it's something to keep an eye on because it's something you want to treat.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Now your squeeze, well what kind of medicines did she take for that.

PATIENT X11
You know I really don't.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
Except that I know that it's been a problem for her for a few years now.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X11
And uh it hasn't, it's not cancer.

DOCTOR X11
No, no I mean there's nothing to suspect that at this point and you need to know um that's nothing I'm worried about.  I'm just telling you, so this is why you know doctors can be concerned about this stuff.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
They need to think about it.

PATIENT X11
Well it suddenly occurred to me if it happens after 8:30 in the evening again, maybe it's like, @@@ I do this.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah don't do that yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X11
Okay I got that part.  Uh so those are the things I wanted to ask.  By the way I've got a friend who had shingles.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
It's horrible.

DOCTOR X11
Terrible.

PATIENT X11
Yes.  He said, he said have you ever had a shot for shingles, I said no why.  He said you can have like an antibody shot, a shot for shingles prior to getting shingles.

DOCTOR X11
Yes.

PATIENT X11
After which once you get it you're toast, you're in for the ride.  So here a guy that had an itch that I really don't feel comfortable with and uh and it held on for a while if I was just wondering if the shingle shots were available?

DOCTOR X11
Yeah we can get you one.  Uh they're probably going to be, so I don’t think I could give it to you today, be able to schedule this for you, you have to come back and get it.

PATIENT X11
That's fine.

DOCTOR X11
But it's no problem.

PATIENT X11
But if it's available I'd like it.

DOCTOR X11
Did you get a flu shot this year?

PATIENT X11
No, hell no.

DOCTOR X11
You didn't get one?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
I mean I got one when I was in the service in the 50s.

DOCTOR X11
You got to get it every year.

PATIENT X11
It gave me the flu every time xxx.

DOCTOR X11
You can't get the flu from the shot.  Let me get this phone call.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

(DOCTOR ON PHONE CALL: 45:56 until 47:13)

DOCTOR X11
Okay, sorry about that.

PATIENT X11
No that's okay.  Uh the only thing else I got is, I got a friend, a lady, that socially I know, has had Grover's disease.  I said oh yeah I had that, @@@.  So she had some and she's a little obese but in any case she got light treatments for it and it was very effective.  Now I'm just sitting here, I'll get up sometimes in the middle of the night I'll have sensations on parts of my body and in Grover's disease it's laying there.  You know it's not dormant it's just preceded.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
I'm not comfortable.  I know its there.  I mean you know I just have the awareness, it's a cold shed that's all.  I just wondered if I got if I need to go to Dermatology and see if that might be an avenue that might.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
Put this in.

DOCTOR X11
I'm fine with that.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
I don't know enough about it to say whether it's a good idea.  I know I just looked at all the medications down for this and there are quite a few and I wouldn't be the one doing the treatment so I would say you call the Dermatology Clinic and say look I want to talk about this option.

PATIENT X11
Cool, I'll do that.  Other than that I guess uh.  What medicines do you show me getting?

DOCTOR X11
Uh terazosin, uh for prostate.  Finasteride, both those right?

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.  You take uh simvastatin.

PATIENT X11
I take uh, simvastatin I don't take.

DOCTOR X11
You stopped taking it?

PATIENT X11
Just a minute I said the simvastatin I am taking.

DOCTOR X11
But it's not on the list.

PATIENT X11
Not on the list.

DOCTOR X11
It just expired that's all, renew it.

PATIENT X11
Okay.  I would like uh, I would like some medicine like a two months supply of medicines.  It's pretty stable, so a two or three month's supply of medicine of those three sent to me if you will.

DOCTOR X11
Sure.

PATIENT X11
Then @@@.

DOCTOR X11
I have some other creams and other stuff you use as well.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.  You know what, to be truthful with ya.

DOCTOR X11
Which ones of these don't you use?

PATIENT X11
Uh the cream that I don't use.

DOCTOR X11
Capsaicin, you use that one?

PATIENT X11
Capsaicin.  I don't use that.

DOCTOR X11
Okay we'll get rid of that one.

PATIENT X11
Okay and uh that's it.

DOCTOR X11
This uh, this steroid cream you still use?

PATIENT X11
Uh, yeah I've got some still in stock and once in a while if it bothers me.

DOCTOR X11
Which one do you use?

PATIENT X11
Uh, you know.

DOCTOR X11
The @@@ and another one, do you use both of them?

PATIENT X11
Uh, I should.

DOCTOR X11
@@@ this one @@@.  Do you use those?

PATIENT X11
Very, very sparingly.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
Usually on a hot spot, I've got maybe seven or eight spots on my body that are, they're more bothersome than others.  I mean I could, you can scratch it and you know you're in trouble.  It's one of those when I itch too good, kind of a deal.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah, okay.

PATIENT X11
I've got a half dozen of those spots on my body.

DOCTOR X11
What about these other ones, hydroxyzine, do you take the Zyrtec, do you still take any of those?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Okay I'll get rid of those and then that shampoo you still use?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
You don't use that either?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
I thought that stuff worked pretty good for you.

PATIENT X11
Ah it did but you know, I've got about six bottles of it.  Heck it was really designed to put on my body when I was in, pretty extreme.

DOCTOR X11
Flares right?

PATIENT X11
Yeah and uh and it was just supposed to be all over my body.  Well I never, I got a little better and I stopped using the darn stuff.   So it was like a salve really.

DOCTOR X11
Okay, I can stop it.

PATIENT X11
You can dump, yeah you can dump that.  That's my shopping list ho, ho, ho.

DOCTOR X11
From me to you.

PATIENT X11
(Laughs) Whatever but uh, but uh the tremor I have it's this funny, odd motion where I'm using shoulder and different muscles you know and it comes up here and it's in the morning, maybe I'm not ready to give it a whirl or what.  It kind of catches me in the morning first thing.

DOCTOR X11
Uh alright lets.  

PATIENT X11
So the reflux, I’m good, we're gonna watch it if it's okay with you.

DOCTOR X11
No what's the.

PATIENT X11
And I'm not gonna eat after 8:30.

DOCTOR X11
That's, that's one way to do it.  Let's uh, there's a couple of things we could do about this really.  Um, @@@ a while.  Okay, we need to recheck your blood on your next visit; we're fine on this visit okay.  And your blood pressure was okay um.  You ever take your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X11
Um no.  I've never had high blood pressure.  As a matter of fact most surprising it's down in the 59 or 60s; it's usually be 70 and 110 or 112.

DOCTOR X11
Oh. Okay.  Alright come on here we'll take a look @@@.  I'll let @@@ do some of this stuff.  Okay.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Alright let's see your hands, stick @@@ all the way.  @@@ that's what I do.  Keep your arm straight.  Ah see this doesn't count, @@@.

PATIENT X11
Stop.  Also I speak Spanish.

DOCTOR X11
Alright @@@.

PATIENT X11
Now.

DOCTOR X11
@@@.

PATIENT X11
Okay.  If I didn't drink coffee I'd never even be talking about this.

DOCTOR X11
You don't believe in coffee @@@?

PATIENT X11
Oh yeah, it's just that I'm sensitive.  You know hot coffee, you're pretty careful about things that you lift.  

DOCTOR X11
One thing is after you drink coffee do you get the tremor?  

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
That's the first shot.

DOCTOR X11
Okay let's do this uh, finger of your right hand, touch your nose, touch my finger, nose again, touch my finger, nose.  Okay other hand, @@@.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
What that is it's called an essential tremor.  It kind of runs in families but a lot of times it doesn't.  It's nothing to worry about.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
It's not like a Parkinson's type thing.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
It's just stuff some people get.  It's like a nervous twitch.  More common in old age.  Unless it really bothers you and inhibits what you're doing, there's not a good treatment for, for tremors like that.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
So I would uh, you know I would just try to live with it the best you can.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
If it gets worse or you notice things happening when you're not moving, when you're just kind of resting and that's when we need to think about other things; so for now I would have you just.

PATIENT X11
Okay.  I'll just qualify it and if it gets worse.

DOCTOR X11
It's called essential tremor.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
You can look it up if you want but that's just, it's a benign thing.  It's nothing to worry about.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.  Breathe normal for now.  No chest pain, no trouble breathing?  Deep breath in and out. (Examining patient) Another deep breath.  Open your mouth, ah.

PATIENT X11
Ah.

DOCTOR X11
Okay lay back for me and lift up your shirt as well. Can you unbutton or?  Okay up here?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
No change in appetite?

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
No weight loss or anything like that?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Okay climb off.  Alright.  Um so this seems like reflux you're right.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.  Yeah now that bothered me cause she's had it for the last two or three years off and on.  You know fighting it and doing whatever, so she, we're very aware of it and the ramifications of course.

DOCTOR X11
Um, so the foods I mentioned causes trouble with those foods or late at night um and then we'll try this medication.  We'll try it for a couple of weeks, maybe a month, two months to see how it does.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
@@@ for long period of time.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
So we'll use it once in a while and that's fine and at then at some point we'll try to stop it and see if the symptoms have improved even off of it.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Okay does that make sense?  It's called omeprazole when there's just lot of acid to your stomach, so if you have some reflux it doesn't cause any problems.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
It doesn't irritate the lining of the esophagus okay.

PATIENT X11
@@@ frequently she sleeps with two pillows so that her body is tilted a little up, it seems to help.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah it can help.  I don't @@@ for you.

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Uh, give me a second and I'll be right back.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Oh you know what else is going on?

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
When was your last colonoscopy, it says what was it five years ago or so?

PATIENT X11
Me?  Colonoscopy?  You know what I just had, I just had a operation for prostate and they went in through my.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah but that's not a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X11
Well, that's such a fun thing.

DOCTOR X11
You were probably told you need another one um we generally seem to stop screening about 75 to 80 uh but you had polyps on your last one right?  From what I remember.

PATIENT X11
Mmm.

DOCTOR X11
Uh so that's something that we need to look into.  If you have polyps you're supposed to follow them up every five years or so.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.  I.

DOCTOR X11
Hey I mean you're pretty healthy.

PATIENT X11
I don't want to be a hero or anything you know just.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
If it's time, we'll get the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR X11
Where'd you have it done last?

PATIENT X11
Out in Aurora at uh.

DOCTOR X11
In the VA Aurora?

PATIENT X11
Not in the VA.  I was using the Medicare.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
Uh.  I have a doctor out there at uh.

DOCTOR X11
Do you know what hospital you had it done at?

PATIENT X11
No.  @@@.

DOCTOR X11
@@@ Copley?

PATIENT X11
No.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
One farther out west uh.

DOCTOR X11
I'm not sure then.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X11
You know what, I mean I'd like to see the records if you could get them.

PATIENT X11
I can.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah cause that would @@@ to have one done here um.  You know for most people who are 76, I honestly say it's no problem, for you I think it's worthwhile doing.

PATIENT X11
I'm probably going to be around a while.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
Everything else equal.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
Okay.  I'll get em.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
Uh do you want me then to uh.

DOCTOR X11
You can just bring em with you next time if you want.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
You won't have to pay, bring em the next time you come in.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Um I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  59:41  DOCTOR IN:  64:04)

DOCTOR X11
Alright.  Um, let's try this medication called omeprazole for your stomach.

PATIENT X11
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X11
Take it once a day.

PATIENT X11
Alright.

DOCTOR X11
It doesn't matter if you take it morning or night.  Take it in the morning with these other medications.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Now we'll try it for about three, two or three months.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
And we'll see how you do.  If your symptoms are not completely better we may have to do the scope to look for some other thing accompanying this.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Fair enough?

PATIENT X11
Sounds good.


DOCTOR X11
Um, a few times three months, try to get those records for your colonoscopy.

PATIENT X11
In three months I'm gonna be in Florida.

DOCTOR X11
When you coming back?

PATIENT X11
Probably.

DOCTOR X11
Ever?  Are you coming back?

PATIENT X11
Well, yeah I come back when it gets warm up here.

DOCTOR X11
When, when is that?

PATIENT X11
Uh, I usually I'm down there for the month of March, big part of February.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.

PATIENT X11
So I usually get back April.

DOCTOR X11
So that's ah like six months or five months from now.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.


DOCTOR X11
Okay.  


PATIENT X11
Well obviously, I'm not going down for another month or two so you know, if these things haven't been alleviated.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah we usually want to use the medicine.

PATIENT X11
I'll be like on like a cold sweat.

DOCTOR X11
You want to use the medicine about eight weeks or so.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
But yeah I mean if you're, if you have no improvement after you know a couple weeks of this medication.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Let me know.

PATIENT X11
Okay I will.

DOCTOR X11
And uh you know what if the pain gets worse off on this medication you know let me know or you know the reflux symptoms get worse.

PATIENT X11
It is distressing to say the least.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah.

PATIENT X11
I mean it will wake you up like a shot.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah but I think we know what it is so that's pretty reassuring.

PATIENT X11
Okay, okay, that's good.

DOCTOR X11
And this usually treats it pretty well.  So if it will be about five months, we'll say five months we'll have you come back.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
We'll see how that's doing.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Like but yeah in the meantime, if it's getting worse or anything, just let me know so we can try to get you set up for this.  We'll get some baseline um blood draws today.

PATIENT X11
Okay alright.

DOCTOR X11
@@@.

PATIENT X11
I got here at 2:30 I think.


DOCTOR X11
@@@.  For your PSA?

PATIENT X11
Uh, they never, I just went down and got it because they said come in early, get some blood drawn, but I didn't have, they didn't die it or anything.

DOCTOR X11
Yeah, @@@ from the Radiation @@@.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
What we need um, I want to check your blood levels with this and uh your Lipitor for next time you come in, your cholesterol panel.  We just need a fasting lab.

PATIENT X11
Okay.  I'll get my blood taken again.

DOCTOR X11
So yeah, I'll let you get your blood taken again today.

PATIENT X11
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X11
And then again before you come in next time.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Fasting, so you don't have to do it now, you can do it in April or you need to do it fasting.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
@@@.

PATIENT X11
Even this time, so I should fast for this time?

DOCTOR X11
No so this time we could do it right now before you leave.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.  Next time you come see me, in five months.

PATIENT X11
Well you say we'll have a baseline and we'll be able to.


DOCTOR X11
Uh come with the colonoscopy record, come with this lipid panel.

PATIENT X11
Yeah.

DOCTOR X11
And the cholesterol panel and uh I will put in for the vaccine @@@ for the vaccine called the Zoster vac.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
You know what, when they call back in to do the Zoster vac, you could do the blood draw then if you want.

PATIENT X11
Yep, okay.

DOCTOR X11
Or you can do it today.

PATIENT X11
Okay, when would that?

DOCTOR X11
I think it should be in the next week.

PATIENT X11
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X11
Okay.  

PATIENT X11
Uh, you know.  As long as I'm here I might as well have the blood drawn.

DOCTOR X11
Okay, that is fine.

PATIENT X11
I'll just stop on the way out so.  Okay, so I'll be sure I have the, why can't I think of that hospital?

DOCTOR X11
I don't know, the only one I know about there is the Copley.  They'll mail this stuff out to you, the medication uh.  You should be getting it in the mail and @@@.

PATIENT X11
I'm kinda figuring that will pretty much tie me over till you know.  I don't want to be in Florida and running out, that's the whole thinking.  Once you change your address to send it to you that's your new address and I got to change it back.

DOCTOR X11
Well the thing is yeah I don't want it, you know this medicine is for a limited time use so if you're using it five months down the road that's, we like to see is to use it for two or three months.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
And see how it does and then stop it.

PATIENT X11
Okay.

DOCTOR X11
That's the idea.  We don't want you on this for a long time.

PATIENT X11
Alright.  @@@.

DOCTOR X11
Okay, alright.  We'll get you set up.  Get your blood drawn here.  So they'll call you when they're ready after that you will see the nurse who will get you set up for the vaccine.

PATIENT X11

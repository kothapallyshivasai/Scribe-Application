DOCTOR X670
PATIENT.

PATIENT X670 
Yeah.

DOCTOR X670
I'm DOCTOR nice to meet you.

PATIENT X670
@@@.

DOCTOR X670
How are you?

PATIENT X670
@@@.  

DOCTOR X670
How are you doing today?

PATIENT X670
I'm alright.

DOCTOR X670
Alright.  I know you were seeing DOCTOR before, but he's no longer here um.

PATIENT X670
Any particular reason?

DOCTOR X670
Why he's not here, he was just here for a year.  He's actually doing a fellowship.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
So I'll be taking care of you.  Um so I see in his notes before he was treating you for knee pain and @@@.

PATIENT X670
He never treated me.  I told him about it.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  So we'll have a look at your knees and I'm gonna order some x-rays of the knees.

PATIENT X670
Um I hurt myself when I was out in Iraq.  I'm not sure how I did it or at one time I was like doing a PT test and I come out of a run and after that it kind of like buckled on me.

DOCTOR X670
Which one is it?

PATIENT X670
My right knee.

DOCTOR X670
The right knee okay.

PATIENT X670
But since then it’s gotten worse and I don't know if it's just like my left knee is compensating for it or whatever that my left knee is actually worse than my right knee now.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
And uh all that's for the knee and uh the heavy @@@ I don't get them as often.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
I try to change things like my eating habits.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
I was smoking pot before and I stopped that too so.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
I don't know if that helped or anything.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  Now do both of your knees give out on your or?

PATIENT X670
My right knee's doing it since like @@@.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
But the pain is more in the left knee.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  What about your hip, do you have any problems with it?

PATIENT X670
No.

DOCTOR X670
Are you still active?  Do you exercise regularly?

PATIENT X670
Every day.

DOCTOR X670
You do okay.  Are you taking anything for the pain?

PATIENT X670
No.

DOCTOR X670
No.

PATIENT X670
That's what the pot was for.

DOCTOR X670
Oh okay.

PATIENT X670
I do a lot of running and I don't know if that's bad for the knee.  I was doing the elliptical for a while but I kind of got bored with it so I started running again um and at work I work at, I'm carpenter at a high rise so I'm always going up and down the stairs and that takes a toll on it.

DOCTOR X670
Yeah that probably does.  I mean if you ask the arthritis doctors for cardio they recommend @@@ stationary bike cause it works in different quads and it doesn't put a lot of strain on your bones @@@ but you know you can't really do much about that at work.

PATIENT X670
Well you know, when I come and seen the other doctor I told him about it and I wanted to see if I could get x-rays but he didn't do anything for me so I went to my own personal doctor at Rush.

DOCTOR X670
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X670
And they took x-rays and they told me that I had a slight tendinitis.

DOCTOR X670
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X670
And uh since then it has gotten worse.

DOCTOR X670
So the best way to treat tendinitis to get you some NSAIDs, like ibuprofen or Naproxen because that takes down the inflammation.  Um did they tell you anything once you got your x-rays there, like what they want to do to treat you or?

PATIENT X670
I uh had insurance at the time.

DOCTOR X670
Right.

PATIENT X670
But that ran out so I didn't really go back.  They had suggested PT but uh like I said my insurance ended so I didn't get a chance to see them.

DOCTOR X670
And then you're already exercising @@@ I don't know how much more.

PATIENT X670
Right that's what I thought too.

DOCTOR X670
How much @@@ would add.  The only thing not to do is the @@@ cause the point is to just have you keep as much stress off the knee as possible while your tendons get better.  Um so the one thing to do would be to ice it um whenever you're not using it and then also to take NSAID pretty much daily for about a week or two until the inflammation can go down.  So um let's see your kidneys look @@@.  So your kidneys can tolerate ibuprofen and you take it you know three times a day for about two weeks, this should help with inflammation.  Uh are you taking anything for pain, is that why you think your left knee's compensating?

PATIENT X670
Yes.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  Did they do both knees?

PATIENT X670
Yes.

DOCTOR X670
Alright and both knees have tendinitis or just the right one?

PATIENT X670
The right one.

DOCTOR X670
Um do you think there's any way for me to get those x-rays from there?

PATIENT X670
I could call and transfer the films.

DOCTOR X670
Okay cause the only other thing would be um you know we could probably get some x-rays from here since you're gonna be, you're gonna be transferring all our care here now is that right or no?

PATIENT X670
I don't even know how I got this appointment.

DOCTOR X670
Okay, well okay.  So you don't have insurance otherwise is that correct?

PATIENT X670
Not at the moment.  It should be kicking in anytime soon.

DOCTOR X670
I see.  So you may not be following up here?

PATIENT X670
Probably not.

DOCTOR X670
Probably not okay.  So wherever you're gonna end up going, you could have the x-rays with you so that they don't need to be repeated.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
Um if you get worse then the next step would be to get a MRI to see if there's any like um, like a ACL tear or PCL tear.

PATIENT X670
Well I mean it has gotten worse.  Would there be any way to get the MRI done?

DOCTOR X670
Um let me examine you first and see if there's any laxity in your joints there.  Cause I mean if you're going down the route of a MRI then the next step would be if you wanted to get surgery done for it to repair it, so that would be the next step to consider.

PATIENT X670
Oh you're asking me?

DOCTOR X670
Yes, no I'm asking you is that something you would consider?

PATIENT X670
Yes I would.

DOCTOR X670
You would okay.

PATIENT X670
And um one of my friends tore his ACL and he got operated and everything and he was going to the PT but he was doing like stretches and stuff just to try to like @@@ with it and I started stretching cause before I wouldn't stretch when I was at the gym and I started and I hadn't really noticed a difference on the knee then.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
But then again, I guess that it could be from work cause we go up 20 something flights of stairs and I got my pouches I don't know how many pounds of weight that's on my hip.

DOCTOR X670
Yeah.  And you don't have a choice.

PATIENT X670
No.

DOCTOR X670
Not at work.

PATIENT X670
Well I do now, there's a noise ordinance.  It's just like one of those @@@ so we could take the elevator now instead of taking the stairs.

DOCTOR X670
Oh okay.

PATIENT X670
But I still have to take the stairs sometimes.

DOCTOR X670
Right.

PATIENT X670
So it's a lot better than before though.

DOCTOR X670
It's better to use the elevator.

PATIENT X670
Right.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  Come over here.  Deep breath.  Do you know where you're gonna be transferring your care?

PATIENT X670
xxx.

DOCTOR X670
Okay cause the only thing is um actually if you're gonna get Ortho stuff done, if you can go back to Rush @@@.

PATIENT X670
Right.

DOCTOR X670
Um the only thing I would say about doing an MRI now is that wherever you end up going, they're going to refer you to Orthopedics you have to see a General Medicine doctor then we'll send you to Ortho.  Ortho likes to have MRIs done within the last 30 to 60 days of them seeing you so it would be a waste to get it done now if your insurance doesn't kick in for another couple of months, then it's just gonna be a waste um and then you're gonna have to repeat it again anyway.  So what I would say for you, if you know for sure you're not gonna be staying here that we don't get the MRI now, we get it done when you establish care wherever you're gonna end up going.  Do you know when your insurance kicks in?

PATIENT X670
I don't know.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  So you know it's something to consider.  If it doesn't happen for another year then you know by all means we can at least get that done now and you can see Ortho here cause the Orthopedics here are from xxx.  Um but um if you know like for sure you're gonna be getting it in the next several months then I don't think it's very cost effective to do one now and then have to repeat it again.

PATIENT X670
Right.

DOCTOR X670
@@@ so, something to consider.  Let me take a look at the knee and I'll look at that one too.  Okay.  No swelling.  Okay can you lay back for me?  xxxd this knee, any pain when I do that?  No.  No pain in here huh?  When I'm pushing?

PATIENT X670
Um not like extreme pain but.

DOCTOR X670
You can feel it in here?

PATIENT X670
Yeah.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  Yeah the knee doesn't look like it's um, like the knee joint itself doesn't look like it's relaxed.  Let me try this one.  Maybe a little bit right there.  Yeah this knee actually doesn't look bad in terms of the ACL and the PCL cause you should be able to keep the knee joint moving when I'm putting all the different stresses on there and it doesn't look like it was doing that.  So why don't you think about that for a second.  I have to go talk to my attending um but um.

PATIENT X670
Think about what part?

DOCTOR X670
About the MRI.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
Whether or not you're gonna be staying here @@@.

PATIENT X670
The reason was, like I said, I don't know how I got this appointment.  Um but the reason that I didn't want to stay was because of the previous doctor.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
I asked, like I had just gotten back from Iraq and you know I started to go back into the dating scene and everything cause I came back single.

DOCTOR X670
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X670
And uh I asked to get checked for STDs and everything and he said okay we'll take care of it in another month but @@@ month I had already caught something.

DOCTOR X670
Yeah.

PATIENT X670
And that's when I lost interest in the VA.

DOCTOR X670
I see.

PATIENT X670
Cause I also asked for it.  Actually so whatever.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.

PATIENT X670
And he didn't do anything about so that's my reason.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  Yeah I can understand that.  Um so I'll be here until June.  I graduate in June and then another physician will take over.  Um DOCTOR is my attending.  She kind of like oversees the residents.  She'll still be here so she kind oversees your care.  You will be seeing me until June in the clinic and then somebody else will take over so that's just sort of how it goes with the VA being like a teaching hospital.

PATIENT X670
Right.

DOCTOR X670
So there are residents here for the clinics but if you would like to stay here I have no problem with ordering an MRI of the knees.

PATIENT X670
I could stay here @@@.

DOCTOR X670
Okay for that reason okay.  Um so we can go ahead and proceed with that and see if there's anything um that is surgical um.  It may not be, it could be just inflammation of the tendons but just plan to use the ibuprofen for a couple of weeks and ice it and try to do the quad exercises and try to do low impact.

PATIENT X670
I was in Kuwait; I'm not sure what it's called.  They gave me some pills, glu.

DOCTOR X670
Glucosamine?

PATIENT X670
Yes.  They gave me that but it, I'm not, I tried to.  Like I said taking them but then I forgot and they said I had to take it for so long and I just.

DOCTOR X670
So the other thing that they do here to, if the NSAIDs don't work, the ibuprofen doesn't work and the pain persists then another options would be just to do an injection of your knee, it's a steroid injection that helps you calm down the inflammation.  Um we do have lots of people that have arthritis or osteoarthritis of the knees and it helps.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
Um now for some people it helps for several months, some people it helps just like a couple weeks, it just sort of depends on you.  Um after you've tried a trial of the steroid injections and these still don't work, there's something else called it's kind of like the glucosamine but it's an injection called Synvisc.  And what you'd need to do, you'd actually have to go to the Arthritis Clinic for this but they inject your knee once a week for a total of like maybe six injections and that, for some people it really helps.  It's kind of like a gel-like thing for the artificial cartilage.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
Kind of thing that they can inject and that has helped.  It kind of helps to um bathe it in the joint a little bit.

PATIENT X670
@@@.

DOCTOR X670
It's not, it's like just one or two days, it's not that bad.  I did a lot of it last month cause I was in the Arthritis Clinic and I mean, I'm not gonna lie it hurts when the needle goes in but it's really @@@ so.  One of the things to consider but we'll do other stuff @@@ try the medications first and if that doesn't work we can think about injections.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  33:41  DOCTOR IN:  37:54)

DOCTOR X670
Alright.  So should I order the MRI?

PATIENT X670
Go with yes.

DOCTOR X670
Yes okay.  So we'll do that.  I'll give you some ibuprofen, like I said we'll try that um I wonder if these labs, um you're gonna need some lab today um only because they need your kidney numbers from the last 30 days and that was back in March.

PATIENT X670
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X670
So you need that lab work.  Okay.

PATIENT X670
You're out of New York City?

DOCTOR X670
xxx xxx xxx xxx yeah.  Any allergies?

PATIENT X670
No.

DOCTOR X670
No surgeries on the brain or heart or anything like that?

PATIENT X670
No.

DOCTOR X670
Do you have any problems with PTSD?

PATIENT X670
I was told I do.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  Do they think it would cause you to have any issues with you being in an MRI machine for an hour?

PATIENT X670
No.

DOCTOR X670
No.  You're @@@.

PATIENT X670
No.

DOCTOR X670
Have you ever had allergies to contrast before @@@?

PATIENT X670
No.  

DOCTOR X670
Then you can try to go and make the appointment for the MRI um its right across from the clinic so if you know where the xxx elevators are, the elevator @@@, they're right across from the clinic, you'll see there's like an elevator @@@.

PATIENT X670
Where we at right now?

DOCTOR X670
We are in Gold Clinic.  If you walk down to the clinic then it would be.

PATIENT X670
At the corner okay.

DOCTOR X670
Yeah there's like a little, so there's like the Lab, there's the Canteen it's the cafeteria and in the middle is a set of elevators and if you go past the elevators that's where Radiology is, the MRI.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
And you can go there to make the appointment.  Yep.  They probably won't be able to do it today but at least they'll let you know when you can come back.  And @@@ um it'll probably take a couple of hours.

PATIENT X670
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X670
And then you can get the ibuprofen from the Pharmacy, so again when you go to the gym just do low impact exercises.

PATIENT X670
Maybe I could just do more bikes.

DOCTOR X670
Yeah.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
So do the @@@, even the elliptical can be hard on your knees so just do the bike um for a cardio work-out and then focus on um building your quad muscles.  Nothing greater than like 100 pounds.  You know it's just something to tone your, I'm sure you already are but just to kind of make @@@.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
Okay.  And I actually want you to come back and see me in a month just to go over the MRIs um and if we need to refer you to Orthopedics I'll do that at that time.

PATIENT X670
Okay.

DOCTOR X670
Alright, so you can pick up, do you know where the Pharmacy is?

PATIENT X670
Yes.

DOCTOR X670
Okay then you can go pick up your ibuprofen from there okay.

PATIENT X670
Okay, thank you very much.

DOCTOR X670
You're welcome.

PATIENT X670
Have a good weekend.

DOCTOR X670
Thank you, you too.

PATIENT X670
Thank you.

DOCTOR X670
That's okay.

PATIENT LEAVES:  42:56.

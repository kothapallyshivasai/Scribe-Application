DOCTOR X306
PATIENT. 

PATIENT X306
Hi.

DOCTOR X306
Good to see you.

PATIENT X306
DOCTOR how are you?

DOCTOR X306
I'm okay.  (Doctor on phone)  Hi, how are you today?

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
So let me just, see if I can find this.  @@@  So I wondered if @@@, looks good.  Well since I last saw you what's been going on?

PATIENT X306
Well you know not much.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Except there's three things.  One is I have some postnasal drip and sore throat.

DOCTOR X306
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X306
And I just finished antibiotics, my wife's doctor I went to.

DOCTOR X306
Oh okay.

PATIENT X306
Cause it's out there but I have a history of sinus infections.

DOCTOR X306
What did you take?

PATIENT X306
Uh he gave me something called Settrabs, have you heard it?

DOCTOR X306
No actually, I'm gonna take a look at that name.

PATIENT X306
Just called her and asked her.

DOCTOR X306
That's alright.  

PATIENT X306
Some kind of antibiotic.

DOCTOR X306
Sometimes you know.

PATIENT X306
Maybe I spelled it wrong.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.

PATIENT X306
Yeah it was a generic actually.  Big white pills.

DOCTOR X306
Hard to swallow.

PATIENT X306
Hard to swallow.

DOCTOR X306
Could you, can I see that again?

PATIENT X306
Yeah, I just spelled it wrong.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Maybe there was something different on the end.  I know it's a B or maybe it's a D.

DOCTOR X306
Oh Bactrim.  That's an interesting drug for uh.  Do you have any allergies?

PATIENT X306
Yeah I've got a history of.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Seasonal allergies.

DOCTOR X306
Okay but not to medications.  Hmm.  That does, it's just not a the first line drug I would use for sinusitis.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
@@@.

PATIENT X306
Well I just finished it on, what was it, Sunday.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
But I've got sore throat back again.

DOCTOR X306
Oh okay.

PATIENT X306
That's why it's coincidental to this visit but that's always my history.  Throat starts getting sore and I got postnasal.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.

PATIENT X306
It's.

DOCTOR X306
And then you start getting the headache again.

PATIENT X306
Yeah and the headache.

DOCTOR X306
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X306
No, never had any.

DOCTOR X306
Anything productive like a green sputum or anything?

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Yellowish, green and I was really get rid of a lot of it with blowing the nose a lot and cleaning a lot of it out.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.

PATIENT X306
But it just kept coming you know.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
It didn't cure it.

DOCTOR X306
And no fever?

PATIENT X306
No.

DOCTOR X306
No chills, night sweats, no fevers.  Any headache now?

PATIENT X306
Just a little, it's here and it's right at the top at the crown of the head.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  Okay and any cough?

PATIENT X306
It doesn't seem to be in the chest no.  It's just a sore throat.  A cough because of the stuff in the throat.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  Okay and otherwise what's going on, anything else?

PATIENT X306
Well there's two other things.  One I've noticed, this elbow aches.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Periodically and I think it's related to, I'm doing a lot of stuff on the computer.

DOCTOR X306
Could be.

PATIENT X306
And so I'm sitting right on the edge of the desk and this edge would be right on the elbow.

DOCTOR X306
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X306
And then it kind of aches when it starts almost like a numb feeling.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.

PATIENT X306
In the thumb.

DOCTOR X306
That's where the ulnar nerve.

PATIENT X306
That I've been noticing.

DOCTOR X306
@@@.

PATIENT X306
I feel like it's a nerve.

DOCTOR X306
To your elbow right here.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
Um arm and when you cup it like this.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
You get like shooting @@@.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
@@@ actually kind of avoid that, maybe put some pad.

PATIENT X306
Well I did put a padding on it.

DOCTOR X306
Or something, did that seem to be helping?

PATIENT X306
Well what helps is if I keep it straighter or if I don't put pressure on it but it aches all the way down like through here.

DOCTOR X306
Even if you don't put pressure?

PATIENT X306
Well after it starts aching it aches.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
For a period of time.  Excuse me um I'm trying to avoid doing that on the computer but I'm left-handed so I.

DOCTOR X306
So it @@@ okay.

PATIENT X306
But now that I use that.

DOCTOR X306
It's not unusual okay.  It's fairly a simple @@@.

PATIENT X306
I think it is related to that computer thing.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah and it's definitely, it sounded like it's your ulnar nerve, the nerve that curves around the elbow and then it supplies basically this part of the hand.

PATIENT X306
Yeah cause I can.

DOCTOR X306
So let me see what's there.

PATIENT X306
That little finger every once in a while gets a little numbish.

DOCTOR X306
Okay, let me take a look here.  So what was the third thing?

PATIENT X306
Third thing was I just got, it's an injury I just got on Thursday.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
I play soccer.

DOCTOR X306
Oh okay.

PATIENT X306
And when I was in the service I had a blunt trauma injury to this leg.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
And it actually, what'd they call it, a herniated @@@.

DOCTOR X306
Oh okay.

PATIENT X306
The muscle underneath was popping up.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
It was bubbling up.  Now over time and strengthening that has gone back down.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
But I didn't get hit or anything but it started right like here and now it's just.

DOCTOR X306
Acting up again?

PATIENT X306
Now its right up into this area and it's tender.

DOCTOR X306
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X306
And I don't, it's not bruised.

DOCTOR X306
And you haven't recently injured it?  When was the first injury?

PATIENT X306
Well it would have been probably 1969.

DOCTOR X306
Oh.

PATIENT X306
When I was in Vietnam.

DOCTOR X306
That's like a femoral.

PATIENT X306
Herniated @@@ femoris.  

DOCTOR X306
@@@ femoris okay.

PATIENT X306
Yeah that's in the record somewhere.

DOCTOR X306
@@@.  Now it is acting up?

PATIENT X306
Yeah and it's pretty.

DOCTOR X306
Do you think that physical therapy would help?

PATIENT X306
I don't know.  I just, I just, maybe I just need to lay off of it.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah have you been and you said this was, has been a factor more recently.

PATIENT X306
Well it just happened on Thursday.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
And towards the end of the game all of a sudden I felt the pain here, it's like right above the knee but when I got up, yesterday I was bent down on my knees on the ground and when I got up it was just shooting pain all the way through here.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
But um.

DOCTOR X306
And no specific trauma that you remember?

PATIENT X306
There was no trauma from it when uh.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  And then do you usually play soccer?  You play soccer all the time.

PATIENT X306
I play twice a month, twice a week.  So that wasn't unusual.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.

PATIENT X306
It wasn't like.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
But what's funny is I can almost feel, I can feel that lump.

DOCTOR X306
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X306
Coming back here where it was.

DOCTOR X306
Oh you can.

PATIENT X306
I've got shorts on if you want to.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X306
Take a look at it.

DOCTOR X306
I will definitely, definitely.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
Let me shut the door and I'll have you.

PATIENT X306
Well I've actually got gym shorts on.

DOCTOR X306
Oh good okay.

PATIENT X306
Cause I.

DOCTOR X306
Figured that.

PATIENT X306
Figured you might want to take a look at it cause it wasn't uh, you can see there's no bruising but when I do this and it might just be the muscle.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  Let's see what it's doing here.  Now do that with this side, yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
The pain is just.

PATIENT X306
The pain is right in this vicinity right here.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  What about when I push down, do you feel the pain?

PATIENT X306
No.

DOCTOR X306
Okay so it's more when you move it.

PATIENT X306
It's more when I stretch it.

DOCTOR X306
This way, more when you bend your knee.  I mean it definitely seems like a musculoskeletal thing.

PATIENT X306
Yes.

DOCTOR X306
For now I can do like ibuprofen and hot packs.

PATIENT X306
And I have been doing that.

DOCTOR X306
Has that helped?

PATIENT X306
Alternating cold and hot.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
And it does seem to help and I think I just need to probably lay off of it.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah that's what I would do.  I mean if it seems musculoskeletal, I'm hoping that'll go away soon, if it doesn't.

PATIENT X306
Initially it felt like it was in the bone.

DOCTOR X306
Oh really.

PATIENT X306
Now that sounds strange but it felt deep, the pain.

DOCTOR X306
Right.

PATIENT X306
And so I laid off for two days, Thursday was when it happened.  Thursday night I didn't play again until Sunday afternoon, then I started to play and it just goes like a real sharp, tearing pain in here.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
So it's fairly recent I've laid off of it.  I just wanted to make sure that um you know.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.

PATIENT X306
Get your opinion on it.

DOCTOR X306
And treatment yeah.  And then I would definitely lay off of it, do the hot packs.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
And ice and we'll go from there.  If it doesn't get better.

PATIENT X306
Sure.  How long do you think this should take?

DOCTOR X306
Give it a few weeks.

PATIENT X306
Couple weeks at least.

DOCTOR X306
Sometimes buckle injuries are bad.

PATIENT X306
I used to have hamstrings so.

DOCTOR X306
Yes.

PATIENT X306
So toes and ankles but.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah sometimes it's just.

PATIENT X306
Something's bizarre again.  It came out of no where, it was at the end of the game.  So maybe I was tired though and I just strained something.

DOCTOR X306
@@@.

PATIENT X306
This is the only things that I can think of.

DOCTOR X306
(Someone comes to the door)  Sorry about that.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
Um so yeah and the other thing yeah so for this I'd probably just stay off of it, hot packs, cold packs, sometimes it takes 3-4 weeks for this all, so lay off of it and let's kind of see how it goes.

PATIENT X306
I can do that.

DOCTOR X306
If you persistently have pain then we can talk about imaging and that kind of thing.

PATIENT X306
Yes.

DOCTOR X306
Now your elbow, so let's see here, does this cause some of the symptoms at all?  Any numbness here at all?

PATIENT X306
I can feel it here on the little finger.

DOCTOR X306
Does it do it all the time or does it do it when I'm.

PATIENT X306
No just uh, not when you're pushing.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
It was doing it before I came in here today.

DOCTOR X306
And anything when I do that?  Okay can you go like this?  Okay.  So actually, so it's called an ulnar nerve entrapment basically.  Like an ulnar neuropathy where when you're having, just exactly what you're saying.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
It's getting spastic when you're leaning like this.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
And you have nerve pain in this nerve and then you start to get numbness.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
All along this area.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
So there's, you know there's conservative therapy.

PATIENT X306
Just stop doing that?

DOCTOR X306
Yeah basically.  Conservative management is stopping leaning on that elbow.  There's also surgical management but I don't think that at this point we need to do it.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
Sometimes people get it really severe where this muscle will be wasting away and this finger will actually physically get smaller than the other fingers.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
Um I don't think you're at that point yet but I would really just avoid.

PATIENT X306
I can do that, consciously do that.

DOCTOR X306
Cause you're at risk and I would just you know, try to just be cognizant of it um.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.  It's probably like an ulnar nerve entrapment basically and it seems like.  I can show you this picture actually.

PATIENT X306
So the nerve runs close to that bone and I'm putting pressure on it.

DOCTOR X306
Exactly.  So let me just, oh that's not what I want.  I wanted to show you the elbow; oh this is not what I want.  It's actually this nerve but it goes around your elbow.

PATIENT X306
Well somewhat, I'm guessing it's somewhat similar to the sciatica if you.

DOCTOR X306
Very similar.

PATIENT X306
I've had that.

DOCTOR X306
Right very similar.

PATIENT X306
I've pulled that before.

DOCTOR X306
A year ago so this is the ulnar nerve root.  If you look.

PATIENT X306
Nerve root.

DOCTOR X306
I just lays behind your elbow going right there and then like you can imagine.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
If you're kind of leaning on it you're gonna impinge it right here and then everything down here, it supplies mainly it supplies your pinky and then your ring finger.

PATIENT X306
Yeah and that's where I feel it.

DOCTOR X306
You're having numbness there.

PATIENT X306
And outside of the palm.

DOCTOR X306
But that's kind of what we're seeing right now.

PATIENT X306
So stay away from that position okay.

DOCTOR X306
And then can I have you have a seat up here sir and we'll check everything to make sure.

PATIENT X306
Yeah my throat is really my biggest.

DOCTOR X306
Have a seat right there.  Okay can you open your mouth and say ah?

PATIENT X306
Ah.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  And do it one more time.

PATIENT X306
Ah.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  So I didn't see exudate or anything like that.

PATIENT X306
A who?

DOCTOR X306
No exudates, no um like mucous or anything there.

PATIENT X306
Oh you don't see anything.

DOCTOR X306
Any ear pain at all?

PATIENT X306
Uh uh.  Just wax.

DOCTOR X306
Hmm.  Now this side, looks good.

PATIENT X306
It's predominately my right side.

DOCTOR X306
Where you're feeling it?

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh, that's where.

DOCTOR X306
This @@@.

PATIENT X306
Things just start yeah.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.  Right now it actually seems like more of a viral syndrome.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
And you've had the Bactrim so I actually wouldn't add on any antibiotic unless you really are having a lot more symptoms and I might add something like Augmentin or something like that but @@@, that would probably just.  I think it really seems more viral at this point.

PATIENT X306
Yeah it was twice a day, 10 days.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
So.

DOCTOR X306
So yeah, I had, like whatever it was it should treat it.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
And we'll go from there.

PATIENT X306
What about the throat, just some lozenges?

DOCTOR X306
Yeah lozenges, that kind of thing and it's just kind of a symptom added usual thing.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
Sorry about that @@@.  Deep breath please.  And the only other thing, I want to recheck your blood pressure.  It was 138/80 before which is a little high.

PATIENT X306
That's higher than normal yeah.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah so let's take it uh, sometimes you know when people are in here and it's like cuff sizes we use are different. 

PATIENT X306
A couple of times in the last three weeks, four weeks maybe.

DOCTOR X306
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X306
When I stand up, I get a little, little dizzy.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Which might just.

DOCTOR X306
Really okay.

PATIENT X306
I've had that before.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
But um.

DOCTOR X306
You could maybe dehydrated?

PATIENT X306
Yeah it's a possibility; I don't drink probably enough water.  

DOCTOR X306
You're pretty active.  You've just got to remember to kind of keep hydrated.

PATIENT X306
Yeah, especially outside because.

DOCTOR X306
Now especially with the weather getting warmer.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
And how's the ankle?  I know last time that was bugging you.

PATIENT X306
No I just, ice it when I need it.

DOCTOR X306
Do you exercise it?

PATIENT X306
I sit when I need to.  It’s getting much better.  

DOCTOR X306
Well 140/80.  It's still a little high actually.  I'm getting high too.

PATIENT X306
Well what size of this do you have?

DOCTOR X306
Well you know one of the.

PATIENT X306
It's tight.  I've heard that before but it's usually in the 130s.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
133, 134.

DOCTOR X306
Let me see what it was the last time you were here.  Yeah I mean it was like 132/74 last time you were here too, but I wasn't inclined to start any medications.  Let's see so, you really aren't on any medicines.

PATIENT X306
Uh uh.  The only thing I'm taking is Allerest.  I was doing that statin, what was it?

DOCTOR X306
Oh yeah are you still taking that?

PATIENT X306
Oh yeah, until I run out.  

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
I've got about another five weeks worth.

DOCTOR X306
Here you are, so I'm just looking at your labs from today.  No diabetes.

PATIENT X306
Well that's good news.

DOCTOR X306
You're white count is good.  You know that lump on your chest as well, is that?

PATIENT X306
Oh I had, I went and had the mammogram.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah I remember.

PATIENT X306
And they called me back and think its fatty tissue.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah, so there's really nothing to do about that.

PATIENT X306
Nope, nope.  That one's fine.

DOCTOR X306
You just kind of monitor it.  Sometimes.

PATIENT X306
I found out incidentally my uncle has had several.

DOCTOR X306
Oh those fatty cysts?

PATIENT X306
Fatty things and they always thought it was some sort of tumor but it wasn't.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.

PATIENT X306
Yeah on his stomach and his back.

DOCTOR X306
You know it's really harmless unless it's bugging you and you know a lot of people do get it surgically removed.

PATIENT X306
No it's not a problem.

DOCTOR X306
Um but you know, it's one of those things if it bugs you and that kind of thing.  Well okay, good so your labs actually look pretty good.  Your lipids look good.  I don't even think we need to start you on anything.

PATIENT X306
And this, I've been doing fairly well.  I'm actually fine um is there anything diet-wise or anything that can change it?

DOCTOR X306
Yeah I mean the one thing that I would say, as far as your blood pressure.

PATIENT X306
I don't eat any red meat.

DOCTOR X306
That's good.  Um what about like increasing vegetable intake and what's your alcohol use been?

PATIENT X306
Oh I have a glass of wine at dinner.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Red wine.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
Somebody said that's supposed to be good for you.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah it can with time.  Um.

PATIENT X306
On occasion I'll have a couple of beers but.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah I mean, nothing concerning.  You seem like a pretty healthy guy.  You're active.

PATIENT X306
Yeah.

DOCTOR X306
You know and sometimes you know lifestyle changes don't do enough.  I mean let's see; now you play soccer a couple times a week.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
What else um.

PATIENT X306
That's probably about the extent of the physical stuff cause I'm retired now so.

DOCTOR X306
Good.

PATIENT X306
Now in the summertime I will be outside more.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
And.

DOCTOR X306
And it might just help and I would say, I'm gonna wait.  I'm gonna have you come back and we'll check your blood pressure again.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
I mean if @@@ any medicine change and you know.  I want to see if we can get this down to kind of more activities.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
@@@ you know play soccer maybe you can do another activity like the other days maybe walk on the treadmill or take a walk outside.

PATIENT X306
Oh I'm gonna start walking now that the weather's nice.

DOCTOR X306
Yes.

PATIENT X306
So we're going out a couple of miles treks.

DOCTOR X306
Good.

PATIENT X306
Every day so that should help.

DOCTOR X306
Good.  And then we'll recheck your blood pressure and we'll kind of see where you can go from there.

PATIENT X306
Do I have to come down here to get this blood pressure checked?

DOCTOR X306
You know we can actually set you up and they can check it manually.

PATIENT X306
Okay cause it's like an hour and a half drive.

DOCTOR X306
I know, I know.  So you can even call in uh with your blood pressure readings in a couple weeks and just let me know what they've been.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
And that kind of let's me see this.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
And then we can go from there.  So I'll order you a blood pressure cuff and I think you can pick it up today while you're here uh let's see here.

PATIENT X306
Now this blood pressure cuff is different than what you're doing?

DOCTOR X306
Oh no, it's the same except it'll be.

PATIENT X306
Does it itself.

DOCTOR X306
Be a manual reading.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah you don't have to read it.  You don't need a stethoscope.  It's kind of like the ones at the supermarket.

PATIENT X306
Oh yeah, on those machines.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah it's very similar to that.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
It'll give you a visual reading.  It'll give you your heart rate as well.  

PATIENT X306
Are those pretty accurate?

DOCTOR X306
Uh yeah they should be.  Sometimes they @@@.

PATIENT X306
Taking the one I go with is a jewel.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah.  As long as you're doing it right and you're not moving and you stay still.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
And you're sitting down and your arm is like kind of like a table like this.

PATIENT X306
Yeah sitting on something.

DOCTOR X306
xxxt like this and you have the cuff it should be pretty accurate.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
Whenever you move around and stuff it's not gonna work but if it's in the correct spot above your elbow.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
Make sure you're rolling up your sleeves, no clothes under it then it should be working just fine.

PATIENT X306
Well that might be the problem in the store because.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah if you always have your long sleeves on it's kind of.

PATIENT X306
Sweatshirt and something like that.

DOCTOR X306
It's not as accurate as it can be.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
So okay um otherwise.  So what I will do now is I look on your labs um and you're on a daily aspirin sir?

PATIENT X306
Yes low dose.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.  And then let's see so you got your tetanus shot and then did you get your flu shot this year?  We didn't even have them available.

PATIENT X306
No I didn't.

DOCTOR X306
Okay.

PATIENT X306
I've never had the flu shot.

DOCTOR X306
Oh okay.  So I will go talk with my attending and I'll be right back.  Otherwise, and then really today we'll just probably have you get the blood pressure cuff but everything else.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
I think you're doing good.

PATIENT X306
We're good and then the question now, when I go back, lay off a couple of weeks on the leg.

DOCTOR X306
Yes I would.

PATIENT X306
Okay, uh any idea when I go back if it hurts I just.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah I mean if it's still hurting when you stop and I mean if it's really getting severe we need to get like a MRI or some kind of imaging and see what's going on.

PATIENT X306
But a couple of weeks should give it.

DOCTOR X306
Sure a couple of weeks should give it.

PATIENT X306
Now if we're out walking during the day.

DOCTOR X306
Yes.

PATIENT X306
Like I say with my wife that shouldn't.

DOCTOR X306
That shouldn't affect it.

PATIENT X306
I don't need to wrap it or anything?

DOCTOR X306
I don't think so.  I mean it may help.  If you wanted to go to Walgreens and get one of those wraps I mean.

PATIENT X306
I've got plenty of those yeah.

DOCTOR X306
Maybe at some point.  I mean if it helps, if you feel like it helps use it.

PATIENT X306
Oh I'll try that.

DOCTOR X306
But no because it's more muscle pain, it doesn't seem like @@@ I don't know if it'll be that helpful.

PATIENT X306
Yeah I think it's all in the soft tissue up here.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah exactly.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
Alright, well I will be right back.

PATIENT X306
Super, thanks.

DOCTOR X306
No problem.

(DOCTOR OUT: 71:07  DOCTOR IN:  84:44)

DOCTOR X306
Alright sir, you're all set but I should be able to tell you where to go.  I think it's on the third floor where you can pick up a blood pressure cuff um but I'll have you follow-up in six months.

PATIENT X306
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X306
If you can call in two weeks and just let us know what your blood pressure is.

PATIENT X306
I can give you a call.

DOCTOR X306
That would work.  Um they'll give you the number outside.

PATIENT X306
Oh okay.  That's probably where I came in.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah where you check out.

PATIENT X306
Oh I have to check out?

DOCTOR X306
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X306
I didn't know that.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah so you check out uh right around here.  Just so they know when to schedule you.

PATIENT X306
Okay.

DOCTOR X306
And everything.

PATIENT X306
And I have to tell you I'm really impressed that you remembered my ankle.

DOCTOR X306
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X306
That's pretty good detail.  I totally forgot about it.  Oh this is what I give to them.

DOCTOR X306
Yeah this is for you and I just need you to go around this corner.

PATIENT X306
Thanks a lot.

DOCTOR X306
Oh no problem.

PATIENT X306
Bye now.

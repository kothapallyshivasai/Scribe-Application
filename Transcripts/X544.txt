Follow-up and then uh I got some, well I spoke to DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X544

For @@@ uh @@@ and some wheezing.

DOCTOR X544

So he had, you know, he did the tests.

DOCTOR X544
Yes.

PATIENT X544
And the results coming back.

DOCTOR X544
Oh.

PATIENT X544
He said he wanted this one first cause he's been following me, prescribing different things and he wanted to give me the right stuff.

DOCTOR X544
Alright.

PATIENT X544
But he wanted to listen to my lungs first.

DOCTOR X544
Let me check his last note alright.

PATIENT X544
Hey uh do you guys actually um, do you write prescriptions or do you have the uh the VA process?

DOCTOR X544
Well we write prescriptions through the um.

PATIENT X544
Do that through the computer right?

DOCTOR X544
Yes sir.

PATIENT X544
But you can't write, hand write?

DOCTOR X544
No huh uh, why do you ask?

PATIENT X544
They get expensive, the co-payments that's why.

DOCTOR X544
Through the VA?

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Cause the medicines I can get a lot cheaper so that's why I was asking you that you know.

DOCTOR X544
Well I mean, I'll have to ask.

PATIENT X544
You have to ask DOCTOR?

DOCTOR X544
Yeah or DOCTOR.

PATIENT X544
Okay.  I wrote down the prescriptions that I want, written down on a list.

DOCTOR X544
So let's look, so to get through here expensive for you?

PATIENT X544
Yeah the co-payments.

DOCTOR X544
Let me see @@@ what you're taking first of all.

PATIENT X544
I can tell you which ones I'm talking about that work right here.  I been taking that @@@.

DOCTOR X544
@@@.  For the most part your lungs are pretty good.

PATIENT X544
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X544
Because there may have been a little spot, what we call a mild obstructive defect okay.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Um so obstructive defect, are you a smoker or were you ever a smoker?  Okay, there's no history of asthma or any history of asthma?  Do you have a history of reflux or GERD what we call like a burning over the chest after you eat like at night, stuff like that?

PATIENT X544
Yeah so I have to see if we're making some improvements.

DOCTOR X544
Okay you do.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
You're taking medication for that?  No okay.

PATIENT X544
No.

DOCTOR X544
Um.

PATIENT X544
It's just like you know sometimes uh it's kind of like @@@ or uh wheezing when I lay down.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  When was the last time you saw DOCTOR?

PATIENT X544
Uh about a month ago, the last time I was here.

DOCTOR X544
Cause I just, its last year in May you saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT X544
Uh it was I saw DOCTOR and let's see DOCTOR in July.

DOCTOR X544
In July.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
July what?

PATIENT X544
I guess sometime around this time.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Mid July.

DOCTOR X544
I have the nurse; I don't see the note from DOCTOR.  I see the PFT Report and that was in July, the function tests.

PATIENT X544
Okay.  They didn't add anything.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Cause uh there wasn't really nothing for them to do.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  Okay I see.

PATIENT X544
You see it?

DOCTOR X544
Yep.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Okay I see it.  Okay so you have a couple issues.  It looks like the diabetes is also a major issue correct?  Okay.  Let me just @@@.

PATIENT X544
So far it's been pretty good.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
I been testing myself.

DOCTOR X544
Now what are you on for your diabetes?

PATIENT X544
Um I @@@, glypid, glyper, G I don't know how to pronounce it.

DOCTOR X544
Glipizide?

PATIENT X544
Glipizide and um, oh the metformin yeah.

DOCTOR X544
You're on metformin.  Good and there was a reason DOCTOR said you were having some trouble with the metformin?

PATIENT X544
Yeah I was.

DOCTOR X544
But.

PATIENT X544
But it went away.  I was experiencing headaches with it.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
But as it got into my system I wasn't experiencing any more headaches and I been testing myself and uh been pretty good.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Like when I get up in the morning I test myself and sometimes it's like 95, 115.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Good.

PATIENT X544
And I you know I been testing myself like a few hours after I eat.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
It's like 140.

DOCTOR X544
Really?

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
That's not bad.

PATIENT X544
Yeah I know so.  It's been @@@ cause I was going on my meds.  He had told me to take uh, he told me to take a half a pill, half of it, so I took half.

DOCTOR X544
So you're taking half of.

PATIENT X544
No I take a whole one now.

DOCTOR X544
So you take okay.

PATIENT X544
I take a whole one.  Well that glipizide I was wondering is that necessary to take along with that metformin?

DOCTOR X544
It should be and I think the reason they did that was because your sugar wasn't very well controlled.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Uh and that's why so last time.

PATIENT X544
But he no this I was taking the glipizide and he said because my sugar was uncontrolled he added the metformin.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.  So you're taking metformin, you're taking glipizide, you're taking 20 twice a day right?  20 mg?

PATIENT X544
Well actually I'm taking only 10.

DOCTOR X544
Okay 10 okay.

PATIENT X544
I'm taking 10.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Along with the metformin.

DOCTOR X544
Okay and uh metformin what 500 twice a day okay.

PATIENT X544
Right, right.

DOCTOR X544
And then and you're taking that every day?

PATIENT X544
Yes.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Every, every day without fail and your blood sugars when you wake up in the morning are around?

PATIENT X544
They tend to.

DOCTOR X544
What number?

PATIENT X544
Fluctuate maybe 95, 115 or so I guess.

DOCTOR X544
So that's very good.  Is that better than it has been in the past?  A lot better cause it.

PATIENT X544
Cause when I was waking it was like 150.

DOCTOR X544
Okay, okay.  Now you said two hours after you eat it's how much?

PATIENT X544
It's um, it's about 140.

DOCTOR X544
140 okay.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Um that's fine uh any problems with low, low blood sugar?

PATIENT X544
The lowest I ever went was, I tested myself one time and it was like uh 85.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
That's not, that's not that low is it?

DOCTOR X544
85 is not that low.

PATIENT X544
But when I get below 70.

DOCTOR X544
Then you start feeling it?

PATIENT X544
Well I haven't got below 70 yet.

DOCTOR X544
Okay, alright well that's good.  So then you're not going too low.  Um when was your last eye appointment?

PATIENT X544
I have one coming up.

DOCTOR X544
You do okay.

PATIENT X544
Yeah it's September 23rd.

DOCTOR X544
How about your foot, any foot appointments?

PATIENT X544
I have to make one but I been taking care of my feet.

DOCTOR X544
You haven't?

PATIENT X544
I have.

DOCTOR X544
Okay good, that's good.  And you do any exercise?

PATIENT X544
Yes.

DOCTOR X544
And your dieting?

PATIENT X544
Yeah I uh eat no white food at all.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
No white you know only whole wheat or whole grain and I exercise too.

DOCTOR X544
Alright.  Now your last cholesterol was in May as well.  You're good cholesterol was 124 or sorry your bad cholesterol was 124; your good cholesterol was 40.  Now DOCTOR I think changed your cholesterol medication at that time too right?

PATIENT X544
Uh yeah he did.  He changed it.  Yes.

DOCTOR X544
Now there are a couple, there are a couple of notes here okay.  First of all the @@@ problems, okay.  Now DOCTOR had increased your glipizide from 10 to 20.  Did that ever happen?  The glipizide to twice a day to 10 mg?

PATIENT X544
Yeah that's before the uh metformin.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  But then you start the metformin and then you just kept on the 10 is that correct?

PATIENT X544
Uh I started doing 20.  I mean I was going 20 and then I got on the metformin okay and then I found out that I went back down to 10 of the glipizide and did the metformin and my sugar got better.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  Alright, alright so what we need to do at this point so and you've been taking your cholesterol medication regularly correct?

PATIENT X544
Right.

DOCTOR X544
Okay um and it looks like your cholesterol medication was actually changed at one point.

PATIENT X544
Well they started what simvastatin, yes simvastatin.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah so when was that changed?

PATIENT X544
Oh that was changed when I first, let's see when was it changed; let me think back, it was changed about three or four months ago.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  Well if it was changed three or four months ago.

PATIENT X544
It should be in my chart somewhere.

DOCTOR X544
Well we need to repeat it okay.  Now this says on 06/10 so it says, this note said you're on simvastatin 20 mg okay.  It says they wanted to increase but they were going to re-discuss it on your visit to the uh pharmacist.

PATIENT X544
Yeah we were supposed to do some more tests on it.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
I believe before we increased it to see how my, see how my cholesterol is.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Since I been on the uh the simvastatin.

DOCTOR X544
You haven't been taking that regularly, were you having trouble not taking that regularly?

PATIENT X544
I took I uh actually take half of it.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  Okay but you're doing that every day?

PATIENT X544
Yeah I have it every day.

DOCTOR X544
And but before your cholesterol was last checked in May.  Were you taking it kind of sporadically then like every once in a while or were you taking it consistently?

PATIENT X544
I take my medicine consistently.

DOCTOR X544
Okay it's all good.  Well I mean maybe something we do need to increase is.

PATIENT X544
What?

DOCTOR X544
The simvastatin.

PATIENT X544
Why?

DOCTOR X544
Well because your cholesterol wasn't goal, so a lot of people with diabetes.  Diabetes have certain goals okay and they're with regard to sugar control okay because we know that blood sugar can affect vessel disease, especially small vessel disease and then we also aim to control a lot of other stuff like blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking okay.

PATIENT X544
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X544
Cause you know that can affect heart disease and it turns out diabetics can have hosts of heart disease, vascular disease so anything we can do to limit that is good.  Now all these studies of people that live over the years tend to show that we're
being good doctors if we meet these goals and we decrease the risks of this happening if we meet these goals.  So that's kind of why we have you on it is because we know that if we get your cholesterol to a certain goal, being a diabetic, that will help you live longer.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
So that's why we, that's why we kind of encourage that, we kind of push you to do that stuff.  Um and that's why DOCTOR wanted to increase your simvastatin alright from 20 to 40 cause he wanted to see your bad cholesterol, the LDL, should be around 100.

PATIENT X544
But should we uh do a test to make sure?

DOCTOR X544
Well it's bad so the last time we checked was in May right?

PATIENT X544
I believe so, I can't remember.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.

PATIENT X544
To be honest with you.  You see the lab?

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.  So the last time we checked your cholesterol was in May.

PATIENT X544
Right well that's when I did the blood tests right.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.

PATIENT X544
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR X544
And it was okay but it wasn't quite, it was 124, it should be around 100.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Okay and that's kind of the same for your A1c wasn't at goal either and that's why we added your metformin so okay.  So.

PATIENT X544
So that A1c is a actual test, a test over a period of time right?

DOCTOR X544
Yes.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Yes.  Um yeah and it checks to make sure how well your sugar's controlled.  It should be checked every three months.

PATIENT X544
Okay so @@@.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.  So how about this?

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Cause why don't we check your cholesterol.

PATIENT X544
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X544
Okay, alright.  If your cholesterol is still elevated let's go increase your medication.

PATIENT X544
Well okay.

DOCTOR X544
Alright.

PATIENT X544
Because I think it's what it is, 25 mg.

DOCTOR X544
You're at 20 mg.

PATIENT X544
And I'm doing 10.

DOCTOR X544
You are doing, at least by this; you're doing 20 mg so you get a 40 mg tablet.

PATIENT X544
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X544
And you're cutting them in half.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  So by this you're taking 20 mg so we would increase to the 40 mg alright.

PATIENT X544
That's a whole pill.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.

PATIENT X544
But you're gonna do the test right correct?

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.  If that's what it takes to get you to increase yeah I'll do that.

PATIENT X544
Yeah because I want to make sure.

DOCTOR X544
Alright.  Have you been eating today, you been fasting?

PATIENT X544
Uh, I had one of those bars, one of those Nature Valley Bars.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Cause I forgot.

DOCTOR X544
Oh okay.  Deep breaths, again, deep breath.  Your pulse is a little bit fast today.  Is it always a little quick?

PATIENT X544
Well I'd had been in the gym for about an hour.

DOCTOR X544
Oh you were in the gym?

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
You were working out okay.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
I was gonna say.

PATIENT X544
@@@ yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Hey that's wild.

PATIENT X544
My blood pressure was kind of high cause I had just got done at the gym.

DOCTOR X544
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X544
I'd been at the gym about maybe.

DOCTOR X544
Before you came up here?  Yeah.  And you're gonna set up an eye appointment when you go up front?

PATIENT X544
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X544
Okay so I think that's what we're gonna do alright.  We'll repeat your cholesterol but you need to be fasting so you have to come back and do it okay.

PATIENT X544
Okay.  Have to come back?

DOCTOR X544
Yeah you can do it, I don't know do you come to the gym here or?

PATIENT X544
No I go to @@@.

DOCTOR X544
Okay close by?

PATIENT X544
Huh?

DOCTOR X544
Is it close by?

PATIENT X544
Close by my home.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  How often to get up here?

PATIENT X544
Oh off and on.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  We'll repeat your cholesterol.  The next time you can come back and I'll put it in for like in the next week.

PATIENT X544
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X544
For you to come back in okay.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Any time between now and next week should be good.  Uh I'll put it in for tomorrow morning and you can just get it in the morning.

PATIENT X544
Well what's you gonna do about this wheeze?

DOCTOR X544
Well right now your lungs sound pretty clear okay.

PATIENT X544
Cause I think it's in here cause I have to uh any time I have to use that albuterol.

DOCTOR X544
You use the albuterol inhaler?  You really have to avoid certain foods that gives you um.

PATIENT X544
Well like uh, like if I eat something like pasta with tomato sauce.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.

PATIENT X544
@@@.

DOCTOR X544
Yes.

PATIENT X544
Then I get it, I can't help it.

DOCTOR X544
Right.

PATIENT X544
I like real starchy foods.

DOCTOR X544
Do you have coffee?

PATIENT X544
Yeah sometimes in the morning.

DOCTOR X544
Okay does that set you off?

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Um sometimes people that have, acutely due to reflux or an inflammation in the esophagus from like the stomach acid.

PATIENT X544
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X544
What we can do is you're taking the albuterol; you get what wheezing mostly at night right?

PATIENT X544
Yeah when I lay down.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah.

PATIENT X544
Uh I have shortness of breath.  Now when I get on the treadmill uh you know I have like shortness of breath.

DOCTOR X544
You do have shortness of breath?

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  Any swelling now?

PATIENT X544
Any swelling?

DOCTOR X544
Yeah in your legs or anything like that?

PATIENT X544
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X544
Um how about when you walk regularly?  No?

PATIENT X544
No.

DOCTOR X544
Chest pain?

PATIENT X544
No.

DOCTOR X544
Alright um.

PATIENT X544
You got, can't you give me something for this wheezing though?

DOCTOR X544
What's that?

PATIENT X544
Well can't you give me something for this wheezing?

DOCTOR X544
Depending on what's causing the wheezing.  You know if you're telling me when you're on the treadmill and your short of breath do you mean you're not able to exercise as much as you can or?  How many flights of stairs can you go up before you get short of breath?  Or is that a problem for you or not a problem at all?

PATIENT X544
It depends.

DOCTOR X544
Do you wheeze when you get on the treadmill?  No.  Do you get short of breath still?

PATIENT X544
The only time I wheeze is when I'm laying down.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  And what's this with the treadmill thing?

PATIENT X544
Well when I get off the treadmill sometimes I got to like kind of catch my breath and I don't hear the wheezing.  Like my wife says sometimes when I be talking to her she'd say I hear you wheezing.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  It may be that sometimes if it's worse at night, you know this wheezing it could be just the reflux that's maybe causing this uh your.

PATIENT X544
The wheezing?

DOCTOR X544
Yeah I mean it could be.  So maybe suppress some of the stomach acid a little bit, that might help it too and we could try it.

PATIENT X544
Put this on hold again.

DOCTOR X544
Well obviously I can give you something for it.  I can give you something for it, what do you think?

PATIENT X544
You say you didn't see any problems with my lungs or anything?

DOCTOR X544
Your PFT showed you may have a mild obstructive defect okay.  Now the albuterol should help that.  Does your albuterol help the wheezing that you have at night?  Have you tried it at night the albuterol?

PATIENT X544
Yeah sometimes I can try it.

DOCTOR X544
Sometimes, does it help?

PATIENT X544
Uh yeah it does.  But you know I spoke to DOCTOR and he said that the albuterol is not doing any good and that's what he told me.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
Um he tried to tell me there's no problems with the lungs.  

DOCTOR X544
Yeah well right now it doesn't look like there is okay.  What I'm saying is that sometimes if your stomach acid at night, you lay back and that irritates your lungs cause it can.  It can cause a little constriction and can cause that wheezing.  Your lungs sound clear on exam right now, so there's no problem.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
So what if we try and just suppress the stomach acid alright.  You should take the pills, take twice a day, we'll check it, we'll try it for a month, four to eight weeks, see if that helps at all alright.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Especially at night and then if it does we have our answer.

PATIENT X544
Okay.

DOCTOR X544
Alright.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X544
Can you uh, give me something to enhance my sexual performance?

DOCTOR X544
(Laughter) You just add it on right at the end don't you?

PATIENT X544
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X544
Um man you did good, this is why, no I'm just kidding.  Um yeah we can talk about that too I mean.  I think getting your blood sugars under control that story is fine.  Can we talk about that when you come in more?

PATIENT X544
I was hoping that you'd give me some today.

DOCTOR X544
Alright well I'll see what I can do.

PATIENT X544
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X544
In the meantime, there's another thing, you need a new appointment.

PATIENT X544
Well I want to get the important stuff out first.

DOCTOR X544
Alright, alright, alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:00  DOCTOR IN:  41:10)

DOCTOR X544
Alright.  So you're able to actually get an erection?

PATIENT X544
Uh yes, a little.

DOCTOR X544
What's the problem?  Is it I mean.

PATIENT X544
I want it better.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  So what do you mean better?  You mean you want harder?

PATIENT X544
Yes.

DOCTOR X544
You want it to last longer?

PATIENT X544
Yeah I want it to last longer and I want it better.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  Now are you able to ejaculate?

PATIENT X544
Yes.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.  Is it, do you ejaculate too quick?

PATIENT X544
Sometimes.

DOCTOR X544
That's a different story okay.  But you are able to achieve an erection?

PATIENT X544
Yeah but it's not hard enough.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
My wife want it harder.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
@@@.

DOCTOR X544
How's the, how's stuff with your wife, is it alright?

PATIENT X544
What?

DOCTOR X544
Here's what I'm saying okay is it, yes Viagra could help you.

PATIENT X544
But that's kind of dangerous isn't it?  What about Cialis?

DOCTOR X544
Oh Cialis, Viagra kind of work in the same way okay.  Now both are dangerous if you're on medications that can lower your blood that like a nitrite or salt that lowers your blood pressure if you have heart disease right.

PATIENT X544
Yeah.

DOCTOR X544
And I don't think that you have, you don't have any indication of heart disease right now.  You're not getting chest pains; you're not on any medications like the nitrates okay.  Those are contraindications.  There are a couple of things that are worrisome right that they can cause you know this you know your erections not being so great okay.  So one is vascular disease with someone who has uncontrolled diabetes.  We always worry about the vessels down there being a factor alright.  So that's one thing that's the reason you need to control your diabetes right.  The other thing to worry about is just psychological stuff.  Like sex is psychological as we know.

PATIENT X544
Yeah it is.

DOCTOR X544
Yeah and if you're not as attracted or you've been married a long time, things maybe aren't going as well.

PATIENT X544
(Laughter) There's could be a reason huh?

DOCTOR X544
Well it could be, I mean you tell me.  I mean do you think is this kind of a tough time right now in the relationship or?

PATIENT X544
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X544
Okay.

PATIENT X544
No.

DOCTOR X544
You think there's a psychological component to it?

PATIENT X544
It's part of the psychological I mean that's part of the physical as well.

DOCTOR X544
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X544
So what you're saying that I shouldn't take it so?

DOCTOR X544
What I'm saying is if you want to, I don't know if I can give it to you without, I mean you need to take all the steps first.  The VA wants to get like a urine test, get a blood test right, check into your prostate and make sure that's okay, alright.

PATIENT X544

DOCTOR X686
PATIENT. 

PATIENT X686
Hi.  How are you?

DOCTOR X686
Good.  Nice to meet you.  

PATIENT X686
We got lost.

DOCTOR X686
Oh okay.  Is that it?  

PATIENT X686
Thank you.

DOCTOR X686
Alright, so how's things been?

PATIENT X686
Well I feel much better than I've felt in a long time.

DOCTOR X686
Good.

PATIENT X686
@@@.

DOCTOR X686
Very good.

PATIENT X686
I felt bad all summer you know.

DOCTOR X686
Alright, right.

PATIENT X686
You know so.

DOCTOR X686
You're doing better now.

PATIENT X686
Yeah I'm feeling better.  I mean I still you know get lightheaded after I walk for about a mile and a half.

DOCTOR X686
Oh okay.

PATIENT X686
I mean, I don't know if it's lightheaded or wobbly or whatever but and uh I still have that left eye feels like something is pushing out of it but you know I don't know that is swelling or getting dry or something.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
I've had all that checked and they can't find anything at all.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
You know he looked in my ears.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.

PATIENT X686
A couple of weeks ago.

DOCTOR X686
Good.

PATIENT X686
And there was an irritation in there but they didn't.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
They didn't, I mean when they touched it, it was uh, there was a little spot that was real sore but they didn't make anything of it or anything.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Alright, you're gonna go back and see the neurology doctors it looks like.

PATIENT X686
I cancelled that because it's like I mean, they just, I mean it's just the same thing over and over so I'm just so I cancelled that and I cancelled my, I had a rheumatology because my arms and everything was shaking but.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Uh since I've started doing yoga it feels better.

DOCTOR X686
Good.

PATIENT X686
And there are certain things I have been doing to exercise with my arms so I just think that maybe that was part of it.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
And uh my, the quick burst of headaches that I was having.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.

PATIENT X686
They are gone away, for the most part.  Every now and then I might have a quick burst but.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
It's gone you know.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
The only thing that's really bothering me now is for some reason I get pain down in my lower abdomen.  

DOCTOR X686
@@@.

PATIENT X686
I'd say my bladder but I don't know what it is like to my right side and then down to my abdomen so.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Sometimes and that doesn't happen all the time but when it does it's just kind of quick and intense.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
And one time it did stop me from moving for a while after I used the washroom I couldn't move.

DOCTOR X686
I see.

PATIENT X686
So but that's, you know that's it.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  So it's uh, okay when was the last time you had it?

PATIENT X686
Uh actually it feels sore now.  It happens a few times a week.  I don't know.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
But the first time that it happened was about a month ago I think and I'd used the washroom, I was out and I used the washroom and I went to, I walked out of the washroom and a pain hit me and I could not move.  I had to stand there for a while so.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
And then it you know it just uh comes and it goes.  It's nothing, I've noticed no blood.  There's no discoloration of my urine, it's a light yellow and.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
You know, so I don't know if maybe I'm holding my urine too long or.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Um is there any burning when you urinate?

PATIENT X686
No there's no burning.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
@@@.

DOCTOR X686
Are you urinating more frequently than normal?

PATIENT X686
No.  I mean if I drink more water I will.

DOCTOR X686
Right, right, yeah.

PATIENT X686
But you know, but no.

DOCTOR X686
Um okay, um so this belly pain, it's on the, starts up on the right side and then.

PATIENT X686
It's right here, it's almost like, it's right, it's right here on my left side and I've had problems with this on and off, this side here.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.

PATIENT X686
And then look and this is where it really hurts.

DOCTOR X686
It hurts down there.

PATIENT X686
Down underneath my bladder like.

DOCTOR X686
When did that start?

PATIENT X686
Um the first episode I had was about, see I don't know if I had been having slight pains before when I had that bladder infection or whatever infection I had but I don't recall it so it must not have been that significant.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
But when I, about a month ago, when I used the washroom and then I went out and I went to walk and it's, after I washed my hands I stepped out the washroom and wow that pain hit me, so I said wow. 

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
It was sharp and intense.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
So and.

DOCTOR X686
Okay, just when you were using the restroom?

PATIENT X686
Yeah, but that time but it comes like if I'm sitting down.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.

PATIENT X686
Or something and I get up, I might feel it or something so.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Cause actually I feel it right now in my left side but it's, it's not like intense, it's just you know.

DOCTOR X686
Okay and is it just at the time when you're urinating or is it just like when you're like sitting down or?

PATIENT X686
Well sometimes I'm, it seems to like it's more like when I'm sitting down and I get up or something.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Um.

DOCTOR X686
Exactly.

PATIENT X686
You know but, you know it's, you know but it's, it doesn't come that.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
You know it comes but it's not like regular or all the time or constant I should say.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
But uh and the only other thing I wanted to mention is I got these little white moles coming in my face now, in the last couple of months.

DOCTOR X686
Moles you're saying?

PATIENT X686
Yeah there's one, it's real hard too.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah I see it.

PATIENT X686
And then I was looking, I thought this was a crumb or something.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah, I see.

PATIENT X686
And I start wiping it.

DOCTOR X686
And it doesn't wipe off.

PATIENT X686
Right and then I tried to you know burst it but it won't.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
It's really hard.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
And I say what the heck is that now?

DOCTOR X686
Like what's going on yeah.

PATIENT X686
Yeah and those just appeared, this one just appeared, the one by my mouth just appeared about a month ago.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
And the other one was maybe two or three months ago.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X686
So I know you get old all kinds of things start popping out so.

DOCTOR X686
Sounds good right.  Let me see, if you brought @@@ the last time.  @@@ outside appointment at that time.

PATIENT X686
Yeah that's, that's getting better.

DOCTOR X686
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X686
That's getting better I had uh.

DOCTOR X686
What are you using now?

PATIENT X686
Yeah but, thank God that part is over.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
And it seems like my face is getting better on this side so it may have had something to do with my lips.  Every now and then I get a little numbness.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Uh and I do have another tooth over there that they got to work on but.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
But I'm trying to put that off as long as I can.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  I got it.

PATIENT X686
You know I broke my bridge so that's number one now, I gotta get that fixed.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
I'm getting an implant and uh.

DOCTOR X686
Oh okay.

PATIENT X686
It's probably because of, see I @@@ the front tooth is gone.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
So I'm gonna get an implant there.  Let me stop talking so you can do whatever.

DOCTOR X686
Oh no, I'm just taking a look see if it's uh, cause I know you just saw the, I mean just back in to see all the GI doctors.

PATIENT X686
Yeah.

DOCTOR X686
Other than that, it looks really good.  Okay you still taking the omeprazole?  The acid blocker?

PATIENT X686
No I don't take any of that anymore.  

DOCTOR X686
You aren't.

PATIENT X686
I stopped taking that man.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X686
A long time ago, I quit you know.  I don't want to get caught up in it, you know I just try to not eat late and not go to bed.

DOCTOR X686
Good.

PATIENT X686
On a full stomach and stuff that I can do to kind of help it you know.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
And so for the most part that's okay.  Every now and then I might eat something that makes me a little bit nauseated but.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
Other than that you know but.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Now when's the last time you've seen the Women's Health?  Do you go see them?

PATIENT X686
I haven't been up there ever since last year but it is coming up.

DOCTOR X686
About that time yeah.

PATIENT X686
Time for me to order uh, for them to order a mammogram.

DOCTOR X686
Yes exactly.  I can put that in.

PATIENT X686
Probably takes a long time to get that appointment maybe like two months or something.

DOCTOR X686
Right.  Correct.

PATIENT X686
I mean to get the mammogram set-up; it takes a long time cause I go to the University of Illinois.  They don't do them here.

DOCTOR X686
Oh okay you go over there to U of I.

PATIENT X686
Yeah.

DOCTOR X686
Okay, do you see Women's Health here or do you go?

PATIENT X686
Yes but I have to see Women's Health here.

DOCTOR X686
Got it.

PATIENT X686
And then they refer me to the U of I.

DOCTOR X686
Got it, okay.

PATIENT X686
Cause they just started doing the mammograms.

DOCTOR X686
Alright, okay uh alright, take what patient files here.  Your blood testing looks great.  You started yoga which is awesome.

PATIENT X686
Uh-huh, yeah, I do that pretty often.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
You know doctor uh my blood pressure, I know that its, people always tell me the blood pressure's great but it's kind of sporadic to me and I don't know what that's about.  Like I, when I went to get my implant.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.

PATIENT X686
They examine for that, do you want me to take this off?

DOCTOR X686
Yes please.

PATIENT X686
Okay, when I went to get that examined uh he, my blood pressure was like 106/88, which is a weird number.

DOCTOR X686
Right, um.

PATIENT X686
88 that 88 being so high like that.

DOCTOR X686
So that's, okay.  You know the thing is there's a pretty wide variation in blood pressure cuffs and blood pressures so honestly like.

PATIENT X686
Yeah.

DOCTOR X686
We do it.

PATIENT X686
Maybe something was wrong with their cuff, cause that's weird.

DOCTOR X686
The only time we get excited about blood pressure being too high is when you're consistently elevated for like multiple readings over like the course of a month.

PATIENT X686
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X686
Okay, so I mean if you had an isolated ready that's high, it could just be @@@, do you use a cuff?

PATIENT X686
What?

DOCTOR X686
Sorry a blood pressure cuff.

PATIENT X686
Oh I'm sorry.  But I'm think I'm happy I'm not taking blood pressure medicine.

DOCTOR X686
Right, right.

PATIENT X686
Cause @@@ is bad enough.

DOCTOR X686
Deep breaths in and out.  And again.  And again.  And again.  Go ahead and lie back for me.  So belly pain comes off and on, usually when you're in the washroom sitting down.

PATIENT X686
Well not necessarily in the washroom sitting down but when I'm sitting, like if I'm in the living room sitting and I get up.

DOCTOR X686
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X686
I can feel it down here.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.

PATIENT X686
And it's on the right side, it's not, the left side somewhat but it's on the right and right here, just a little bit.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
But I said man there must be a line or something going from here to here.
DOCTOR X686
Alright.

PATIENT X686
Causing that cause now it's more to the right.  I didn't say I didn't mean the left; it's more to the right than it is to the left.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Can you go ahead and just pull your shirt up a little bit just so I can see your skin.  Any relationship to food whatsoever?  You know.

PATIENT X686
No I haven't noticed any of that.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
That's a little tender.

DOCTOR X686
Okay, got it, okay.  @@@ down there?

PATIENT X686
No.

DOCTOR X686
A little painful there now?

PATIENT X686
It's a little.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Any tenderness over here?

PATIENT X686
No.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Just a little bit of tenderness @@@.  This one here at all?

PATIENT X686
No.

DOCTOR X686
Any problems with diarrhea?

PATIENT X686
No.

DOCTOR X686
So are you just ticklish or painful?

PATIENT X686
Painful.

DOCTOR X686
Over here.

PATIENT X686
When you press on it right here.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Sometimes I feel like a pressure like at my naval, under my naval.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Alright.  No problems with bowel movements?

PATIENT X686
No.

DOCTOR X686
Fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting or anything like that?

PATIENT X686
No I'm just hot and cold all the time, that's.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
That's hormones things.

DOCTOR X686
Right, got it.  

PATIENT X686
And I'm doing my exercises and even if I get tired I keep going.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
And I'm trying to get, you know I'm trying real hard to lose weight but that gets me in trouble.

DOCTOR X686
Right.  

PATIENT X686
But I'm trying to eat @@@.  I'm you know making fruit smoothies and stuff.  

DOCTOR X686
Have you ever had your gallbladder out?

PATIENT X686
@@@.

DOCTOR X686
Have you ever had your gallbladder removed?

PATIENT X686
Um no, no.

DOCTOR X686
When you had that uh the aneurysm in your aorta.

PATIENT X686
That's real good.

DOCTOR X686
Okay, you had uh a mesh placed or a repair?

PATIENT X686
No, it's @@@.

DOCTOR X686
None of the above, we just were watching it.

PATIENT X686
Right.

DOCTOR X686
Alright.

PATIENT X686
The last time they it was three months ago in April.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
I think they said they want to do another one in six months.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.

PATIENT X686
After that but I, @@@.

DOCTOR X686
@@@.

PATIENT X686
Pardon.

DOCTOR X686
Are you having any back pain?

PATIENT X686
Uh just low back but I attribute that to uh right along in here, I attribute that to my yoga poses.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Cause what I do is I do uh twists.

DOCTOR X686
Lean forward @@@.

PATIENT X686
No I do twists; you know I do twists where I'm twisting by contorting my body.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
And made sure that it was okay to keep doing all that stuff.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  

PATIENT X686
I mean I'm twisting my upper torso one way and the lower part of my body the other way trying to exercise my spine.

DOCTOR X686
Right.  Right.

PATIENT X686
And so then after I do that and then some of the uh the standing yoga poses where you, forget the name of them, it's a common one where you stand with your legs opened and your knees slightly bent and you @@@ backwards, slightly backward stance.

DOCTOR X686
Oh yeah, I'm not sure the name of it either.

PATIENT X686
I forget the name of it, God I can't believe I forget the name of it.

DOCTOR X686
I don't know.

PATIENT X686
Um you know it hurts a little bit and I have to uh do something to loosen it up.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.  Okay.  I'm just trying to figure out if we should get that CAT scan.  They wanted to do that repeat CAT scan uh to keep an eye on that aorta uh but I don't think that we.  You know now that you're having pain, you might want to get that, get it repeated a little sooner because we'll see uh.  

PATIENT X686
No I just assumed that if I had a problem with the aorta that my back would be, I would have sharp intense pains in the upper part of my back.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah.  It's definitely @@@ factor, you're absolutely right.  It's kind of atypical.  Um do you think you strained a muscle or something doing the yoga?  Is that possible?

PATIENT X686
No I can tell when I strain a muscle.

DOCTOR X686
It's not like that?

PATIENT X686
No it's not, it's not a muscle strain and I wondered I said man am I passing uh, the calcium that comes in there, cause I was taking so much calcium but I decided to ease up off of that calcium and actually I've been lax with taking my vitamins.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
But I eased off the calcium cause I said man I'm taking all this stuff and uh there was a study that was on the news where they say calcium really doesn't do that much good and I'm saying, you know the calcium pills.

DOCTOR X686
Right @@@.

PATIENT X686
I'm saying oh my goodness.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
For 40 years I been taking calcium and it's not doing any good.

DOCTOR X686
Right.  Well let me take a look see here.  So it looks like you have good kidney function.

PATIENT X686
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X686
So that's a good thing.  Uh.

PATIENT X686
Probably another thing something I want to make sure that my uh, I'm having problems getting my cholesterol medication because the last time it was just, the prescription was renewed for just 30 days.

DOCTOR X686
Oh okay.  So you need a longer prescription on it.

PATIENT X686
Yeah cause at the Women's Clinic they initially renewed it every 90 days but then I would go in and get my blood checked every six months.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
So they just would give me a 90 day supply.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
And it was uh where you can get three or four refills.

DOCTOR X686
Right okay, yeah I can put that in for that for you.  You do not feel like it's a urinary tract infection correct?  But you had one of those before?

PATIENT X686
Yeah they said I had one this summer.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
They said that was probably one of the reasons I was feeling bad.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
Cause I felt bad all summer.

DOCTOR X686
Let's uh go ahead and get another urine sample from you today.  Um.

PATIENT X686
Do you know if Lipitor is better than the statin?  Is Lipitor a statin?

DOCTOR X686
Yeah, it's uh.

PATIENT X686
Somebody told me that uh the Lipitor doesn't cause the muscle problems.

DOCTOR X686
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X686
Or something that the side effects is not as bad with Lipitor as with uh Zocor.

DOCTOR X686
Oh, @@@ yeah.

PATIENT X686
Have you had that or anything?

DOCTOR X686
Uh you're talking about the muscle problems?

PATIENT X686
Yeah uh with, that's why I was kind of curious.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah, I actually don't know.  I'm gonna have to talk about it with somebody.

PATIENT X686
Yeah cause I been taking that a long time.  I can't seem to get my cholesterol down and I eat healthy but I do go overboard.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Okay.  

PATIENT X686
With all the exercise I do, I mean I do two or three hours of exercises a day for about three or four days a week, sometimes five, sometimes six.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
I say man, I try to mix it up, I go walking, I ride my bike, stationary, I do yoga, I do cardio swim now, I do another exercise tape.  I do all kinds of stretches.  

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Let's do this, let me go DOCTOR know about you okay.

PATIENT X686
Okay.

DOCTOR X686
And then we'll go from there.  I'll be right back in just a minute.

PATIENT X686
Okay, okay, thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  102:3  DOCTOR IN:  107:20)

DOCTOR X686
Alright now, so a couple of things.  We just want you to give a urine sample.

PATIENT X686
Okay.

DOCTOR X686
To make sure there's nothing going on with your bladder that um also cause you're kind of having some tenderness in your belly kind of in funny places so we'd like to check some labs on you um and go from there.  Um this is happening kind of intermittently in the last several weeks is that right?

PATIENT X686
Right.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
But the first time was about a month ago.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  So if this worsens at all, don't hesitate to come back here.

PATIENT X686
Okay.

DOCTOR X686
You can either @@@ or you can come to the ER.

PATIENT X686
Yeah.

DOCTOR X686
Um and if the labs are normal, we might just have to pursue some imaging okay but uh like a CAT scan or something.

PATIENT X686
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X686
I don't think we need to go that far, I think just like I think the urine is kind of where the money is.

PATIENT X686
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X686
Um especially cause you had the you know some infection this summer so um I think we'll start there um and go from there.  Then we'll have you follow up in the Women's Health Clinic as well, just to kind of set you up with your routine screenings.

PATIENT X686
Okay.  And did he say anything about the @@@ that.

DOCTOR X686
Okay let me take a look see.

PATIENT X686
It's hard.

DOCTOR X686
That's right.

PATIENT X686
It's right here.

DOCTOR X686
Now did you say is it painful?

PATIENT X686
No.

DOCTOR X686
It doesn't hurt.

PATIENT X686
No it's just hard.

DOCTOR X686
Got it, okay.

PATIENT X686
That came about four months ago and it came about a month ago here.

DOCTOR X686
Have you ever had this problem before @@@?

PATIENT X686
No and I got a ring worm too.  I put some uh.

DOCTOR X686
Some cream on there?

PATIENT X686
Yeah I put some hydrochloride or something.

DOCTOR X686
Okay got it.

PATIENT X686
I got it from a hotel I'm sure.

DOCTOR X686
You did okay.

PATIENT X686
Yeah.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah, alright.  Do you want some terbinafine cream?  Is that.

PATIENT X686
I got some.

DOCTOR X686
Is the cream working?

PATIENT X686
Yeah it's working.

DOCTOR X686
It's working okay good.

PATIENT X686
Yeah I did make up some soda and Vaseline but then I went and bought some.

DOCTOR X686
Okay.  Cause it could be the beginnings of a @@@.

PATIENT X686
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X686
It could be that.

PATIENT X686
Okay.

DOCTOR X686
Um if you have, I think there's a fancy name for it but everybody knows it as the xxx xxx @@@.

PATIENT X686
Oh okay well it you don't think that is anything to worry about.

DOCTOR X686
No, I absolutely, nothing like @@@.

PATIENT X686
Yeah it's just; yeah it just looked like a bread crumb.

DOCTOR X686
Right.

PATIENT X686
And I @@@ you know when someone tells me to wipe my mouth.

DOCTOR X686
If they get worse or like if there's new ones that are popping up or if they become painful.

PATIENT X686
Okay.

PATIENT X686
So what am I gonna, so don't forget the cholesterol stuff.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah so look okay, I'll put in all the refills for everything and yeah we'll extend it out so that you can get like.

PATIENT X686
Yeah all I have to do is call it in and get it.

DOCTOR X686
Exactly.

PATIENT X686
On the phone.

DOCTOR X686
Uh what I could do too is I'll put in all the lab work for you to make sure you're not having any problems, so just stop by the Lab.

PATIENT X686
Oh you know what I might be able to do that now, I mean.   What do you want me to do now?

DOCTOR X686
Oh just some blood and then urine.

PATIENT X686
Okay.

DOCTOR X686
That's the only thing and then you're done.

PATIENT X686
Okay.  What's your blood for?

DOCTOR X686
Uh blood is for your belly.

PATIENT X686
Okay.

DOCTOR X686
We want to make sure there's nothing going on.

PATIENT X686
So you don't think while you're at it that my cholesterol should be checked again or don't you?

DOCTOR X686
So here's the deal, you had.  Let me take a look here I wrote it down.

PATIENT X686
I think, I don't know when the last time I had it.  I think it was, may have been in June.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah we can do you in every year so you're not due for another like six months.

PATIENT X686
Oh okay, they were doing it every six months.

DOCTOR X686
Yeah, I'm happy with how things look with your cholesterol.

PATIENT X686
Okay, great, okay.

DOCTOR X686
I want you to just hand that to the clerk right here and they'll schedule you for Women's Health.

PATIENT X686
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X686
Okay. 

PATIENT X686
Thank you so much.

DOCTOR X686
Very good, thank you ma'am.

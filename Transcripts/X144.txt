DOCTOR X144
Nice to meet you, how you doing?

PATIENT X144
Hmm, I'm doing alright.  @@@
 
DOCTOR X144
Just have a seat over there.  I understand you saw DOCTOR a few days ago?  

PATIENT X144
Yes.

DOCTOR X144
A few days ago, um and she diagnosed with plantar fasciitis.

PATIENT X144
Uh I actually knew that before.

DOCTOR X144
Okay and it flared up?

PATIENT X144
Uh it was bothering me so I went in and asked her to see if there's anything else to be done with it.

DOCTOR X144
Okay.

PATIENT X144
Here's the original x-rays and report on it.

DOCTOR X144
Okay, I kind of reviewed them already, thanks for bringing them in.  Um now when would you say you have your pain?

PATIENT X144
Whenever I try to pick the foot up.  I mean I try and walk on the ball of the foot.  Every time I take a step it feels like there's a balloon in the heel.

DOCTOR X144
Okay.

PATIENT X144
And it crushes.

DOCTOR X144
Alright so let me examine you.  You know what I'd like to do is send you to see Podiatry to see if there is something.

PATIENT X144
I already have an appointment August 2nd.

DOCTOR X144
Alright so they may be the ones to kind of help do the best and they might be able to give you a special shoe and also get x-rays and discussions and things and they'll go over all this stuff with you too.  Otherwise, it looks like you've never really been here in the system.

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
Okay.  So I do have a few questions just to kind of go over and make sure we cover everything else.  We're going to repeat your blood pressure too; it was almost a little high.

PATIENT X144
Okay.

DOCTOR X144
Um do you have any past medical history that you know of or that a doctor has ever told you about or anything like that?

PATIENT X144
No I've had the first right rib taken out.

DOCTOR X144
Okay.  Um and then are you a drinker or smoker?

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
Have you ever been in the past?

PATIENT X144
Um when I was 7, 8 years old I was smoking.

DOCTOR X144
So when did you quit?

PATIENT X144
When I was like eight years old.

DOCTOR X144
How much did you smoke?

PATIENT X144
Probably 2-3 cigarettes a day at that time.

DOCTOR X144
The reason why I ask is we need to see if we need to run some tests to see @@@ arteries.  How long did you smoke, a year, two years?

PATIENT X144
Yeah probably a year.  It was the excitement stealing them from my brothers and sisters and I never really had any alcohol issue.

DOCTOR X144
Any street drugs?

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
Have you ever used @@@?

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
@@@.

PATIENT X144
Uh my mom and dad are both deceased.  Um.

DOCTOR X144
@@@.

PATIENT X144
Uh my father just got old and his body gave out on him.  My mother uh, that cause they don't know.  I know she fell and hurt her knee.

DOCTOR X144
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X144
And I took it as an embolism cause when I got back the doctor said he was talking to her, he turned to write on her chart and when he turned back she was dead.

DOCTOR X144
No problem.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
No.

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
I highly recommend it.  You don't have do it but it's one of those things I @@@.  So they give you a bunch of labs to order for that okay.  And that skin medicine that she's given you.  

PATIENT X144
@@@.  They said it was inflammatory.

DOCTOR X144
I disagree with that one.  I think there's a better one I'd like you to try.

PATIENT X144
As long as it's not narcotic.  

DOCTOR X144
It's not.

PATIENT X144
Okay.

DOCTOR X144
I see @@@.  @@@ I just give you the one that I would give you and recommend it okay.

PATIENT X144
Uh.  The reason I said about the medicine I'm going through @@@ xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X144
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X144
And I have to report all the medicines and they're kind of iffy on some medications so.

DOCTOR X144
Well I don't think @@@.  Um I want to @@@ blood pressure, go ahead and have a seat.  Have you been enjoying the weather?

PATIENT X144
I try.  Well I try and get out and ride the bike.

DOCTOR X144
@@@.  So of course @@@.

PATIENT X144
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X144
Gained some weight @@@.

PATIENT X144
@@@.

DOCTOR X144
Right.  But unless you're competing on your bike.  

PATIENT X144
Actually @@@.

DOCTOR X144
That's definitely something.  Another thing is diet.  The VA has a program called the MOVE Program and they'll help you work with, if it's something you're interested in.

PATIENT X144
Oh it's just something I'd be interested in but where I'm going, I have no control over the diet.

DOCTOR X144
Right.

PATIENT X144
Like whatever they have.

DOCTOR X144
Yeah.  

PATIENT X144
@@@.

DOCTOR X144
@@@ Social Work and everything.

PATIENT X144
Yeah I just got into the @@@ Program last month so.  I'm trying to do everything they ask me to do.

DOCTOR X144
So would be willing to have the colonoscopy?

PATIENT X144
I don't even know what it is.

DOCTOR X144
What a colonoscopy is is they place @@@ into your @@@.  The reason why @@@.

PATIENT X144
@@@.

DOCTOR X144
Ah I forgot @@@.

PATIENT X144
@@@.

DOCTOR X144
So basically what it is um @@@ uh the process @@@ they sedate you, you'll be lightly sedated but you'll still be able to feel some @@@.  They go from behind and um they look to see if there are any lesions in your colon.

PATIENT X144
Oh okay.  

DOCTOR X144
Um the reason why is to make sure you don't have any.  Now if @@@.  You probably get @@@.  Now if we find something.

PATIENT X144
They can treat it.

DOCTOR X144
If we don't find something you don't have to go through it for another ten years.  I will warn you though it is a painful process because of the preparation.  Unfortunately in our bowel you have a lot of stool and that stool blocks their view @@@.

PATIENT X144
Blocks the view.

DOCTOR X144
Of what we're looking at.  So we have to cleanse all of the bowel and make it @@@.  Okay.  And that is @@@ worried about.  So basically the night before you're going to be sitting on your toilet all night long.

PATIENT X144
Alright.  @@@.

DOCTOR X144
Okay.  I'm just saying I still think it's something to do.  But I mean, you wouldn't have to be on the toilet all night long, @@@ bathroom.  @@@.  Does this hurt?

PATIENT X144
Yeah a lot there. 

DOCTOR X144
You need to you take your shoe off okay?  Where's the pain?

PATIENT X144
Right there.

DOCTOR X144
How about here?

PATIENT X144
No there's nothing @@@.

DOCTOR X144
In the heel?  Does this hurt?

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
How about this?  

PATIENT X144
No.

DOCTOR X144
Does it get better through the course of the day or does it kind of get worse?

PATIENT X144
Well it's one of those things that in the morning it's just stiff.

DOCTOR X144
Alright hold on, in the morning.

PATIENT X144
Yeah and then @@@ it continually gets worse.

DOCTOR X144
And then it gets better through the night?

PATIENT X144
Yeah.

DOCTOR X144
When you're not using it?

PATIENT X144
Right.

DOCTOR X144
Right.  So that unfortunately sounds like.  I actually have this myself, @@@.  But there are some stretches that you can @@@.

PATIENT X144
Well.

DOCTOR X144
It's painful so @@@ basically it's doing this, @@@ okay.  And that's to work the entire muscle down below.  I would do it as tolerated okay.

PATIENT X144
Okay.

DOCTOR X144
I try to do it, when I'm having a flare I'll do it, you know I try to do it like ten times an hour.

PATIENT X144
Yeah.

DOCTOR X144
@@@.  Okay.

PATIENT X144
Where does this come from?  Is it just.

DOCTOR X144
Unfortunately some people over use, there's a muscle tendon there @@@ and @@@ in theory could be @@@.  You just take it once a day, that's why I @@@ ibuprofen, you can take it up to three times a day.  @@@. But you know sometimes it’s worse.  Yeah probably in the morning when you're not walking on it.

PATIENT X144
Yeah every once in a while I land on something with the heel.  I try and walk so everything is in line but @@@.

DOCTOR X144
That would be my advice okay.  Um you can hop up there.  Alright.

PATIENT X144
Something's not right, that's just rubs me all the time.  That's the one I was more worried about.  

DOCTOR X144
Um, @@@.  Do you want to pick up your medicines down in the Pharmacy?

PATIENT X144
Yes.

DOCTOR X144
Give me a second, I need to @@@ okay.  @@@.  Alrighty, I'll be back in a few.

PATIENT X144
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  82:49  DOCTOR IN:  89:01)

DOCTOR X144
Well alrighty.  I'll give you a call @@@.

PATIENT X144
Okay.

DOCTOR X144
@@@ okay.

PATIENT X144
Okay.

DOCTOR X144
@@@.  He wants to follow up @@@.  And if you're @@@ not getting any better I want you to call me.

PATIENT X144
Okay.

DOCTOR X144
Here you are.  @@@ talking about @@@.  So basically uh what @@@.  If you come to the hospital and need to see the doctor, I'll advise who I think is right so you don't have to @@@.  Another thing, there are two things a Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney.  What that means is if something happens to you and you're not able to talk, say you got in a car accident and @@@ and you're not able to communicate, we will know what your wishes are.  The Living Will will say that.  Now basically what that means is if something happens @@@ and things like that.  Another thing is uh Durable Power of Attorney.  That means that if you're not able to talk to us, that would be a friend or family member who will speak for you on medical issues.  And @@@ tell them what you want.  Anything can happen.  Of @@@ but it's just a precaution kind of thing okay.  Um @@@ what I need here is I'll have you sign this and have you ever thought, like would you want to do that?

PATIENT X144
It would probably good; I mean I don't have anyone to speak for me so.

DOCTOR X144
So with um, here you go, so what I would do here is uh if you want to make a Living Will uh, there @@@ form @@@ okay and then @@@.  I'll have you sign right here.  Anytime you want to make a change or anything to modify anything, @@@ come by.  Now I'll mention to you one more time @@@.  You might get a different doctor okay.

PATIENT X144
Okay that's fine.

DOCTOR X144
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X144
Well.

DOCTOR X144
Try to stay warm and dry it's supposed to rain tonight.  Are you ready to go?

PATIENT X144
I @@@.

DOCTOR X144
Alright actually I'll have you do a bunch of lab.  @@@.  They'll call you @@@.  Take a right and that'll be where you check out okay.

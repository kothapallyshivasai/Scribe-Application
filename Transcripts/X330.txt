PATIENT X330
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X330
A polyp.

PATIENT X330
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR X330
That's why so it's one of those things that we'd like to follow up because it could go into a cancer and I think after like three years you should probably have it checked.  @@@ if we checked it now and it's not there then you can go back and say okay we'll back off a little bit but I think it's one of @@@.

PATIENT X330

That'll be fine, good.  It's a one time deal so you don't have to do it ever again, ever again.

PATIENT X330
Okay.

DOCTOR X330
@@@.  Are you still taking the pill, the glipizide pill?

PATIENT X330
Yes.

DOCTOR X330
Okay.  Along with the insulin?

PATIENT X330
Along with the insulin.  So I'm supposed to take two in the morning and two in the evening, sometimes I take one in the evening.

DOCTOR X330
We could almost stop and just use all insulin.

PATIENT X330
Okay.

DOCTOR X330
@@@.

PATIENT X330
Okay.

DOCTOR X330
If you want to stop those pills.

PATIENT X330
Yeah.  That means I would have to go to the fast-acting one?

DOCTOR X330
Oh no, all you have to do is the insulin @@@.

PATIENT X330
Okay.

DOCTOR X330
You just do the insulin by itself.

PATIENT X330
Yeah that'd be fine.

DOCTOR X330
Okay.  Let's see, how about what we do is uh, 20 b.i.d. of the glipizide.  Let me see what the pharmacist gave you last time.  So let's keep it on and we'll talk with her and then um we'll titrate it down.

PATIENT X330
Okay.

DOCTOR X330
@@@ get off of it.  

PATIENT X330

DOCTOR X330
That'll work for you?

PATIENT X330
That'll work.  I haven't even used it, I've never used it.

DOCTOR X330
So basically what you do is um take it like um half an hour before you have the desire and you got to give it a little time.

PATIENT X330
Right, right.

DOCTOR X330
And let me know, as long as it's working.

PATIENT X330
Right.

DOCTOR X330
Um @@@ if your blood pressure is low don't take it.

PATIENT X330

PATIENT X330
Well I'm trying to cut out the @@@ bread and stuff.  So sometimes I eat fries I shouldn't be eating.  

DOCTOR X330

PATIENT X330
Right.

DOCTOR X330
Don't take everything away but don't eat as much @@@ stuff.

PATIENT X330
Right.

DOCTOR X8

PATIENT X8
Yep.

DOCTOR X8
@@@ I'm DOCTOR.  I think it was DOCTOR clinic.

PATIENT X8
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR X8
@@@.  How's everything today?

PATIENT X8
Okay, pretty good.  I've already @@@.  When I'm alone, when I don't talk for a couple of days I lose my voice.

DOCTOR X8
Oh oh.

PATIENT X8
If you can believe that.

DOCTOR X8
How come you haven’t been talking for a couple days?

PATIENT X8
No I live alone, you know.

DOCTOR X8
I see.

PATIENT X8
I don't have a lot to say.  That's my biggest problem.  I don't know, you know since I lost a couple of family members.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
And then one of my biggest problems is that I don't sleep.  They did give me the amitriptyline but sometimes nothing helps.

DOCTOR X8
@@@.

PATIENT X8
Okay.


DOCTOR X8
Do you feel like um you're depression is better?

PATIENT X8
Yes.

DOCTOR X8
Or do you think its?

PATIENT X8
I think its worse.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
I thought within a year it'd be a little better.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
But @@@ talking about.  That seemed to be a big problem.  @@@ I think I feel very good until every once in a when I lift stuff I take uh, I can feel my blood pressure and I think I feel really good physically.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
Mentally, that's another story.

DOCTOR X8
Tell me what all you've done as far as, how do you make yourself feel better?  What have you tried?

PATIENT X8
Well, I try to keep very busy you know, involved working with the VFW being the commander, so it took a lot of responsibility @@@.  That was when my wife passed.  So then while I was commander I lost a son, yeah two months, from MS.

DOCTOR X8
And does it, has it ever gotten better.  Have you gotten to where you feel okay?

PATIENT X8
Yeah I guess you know, yeah, I guess you know but.  I have too many bad days @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
But uh you know really I just need try to @@@ this thing.  I'm doing pretty good.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT X8
@@@ everything.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah but I don't really think @@@.

PATIENT X8
Oh, that's the problem uh yeah.

DOCTOR X8
You know.

PATIENT X8
You know, I don't know.  You know my wife had so many medications.  When she passed away she was on dialysis and a whole lot of things but I think they you know a lot of the medications kind @@@ side effect @@@.  @@@ really try that, a wonderful @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Um, have you ever seen Mental Health here?

PATIENT X8
No and I don't think I should you know.  I don't get the, I don't know how to interpret that (laughs).  

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
I don't think its mental problem.

DOCTOR X8
Well, it's called Mental Health, it's really, I mean it's for any kind of depression.

PATIENT X8
Depression and all kinds of things.

DOCTOR X8
It's feeling well, you know.

PATIENT X8
Right.

DOCTOR X8
They can um, they can see you or I can see you and just make it, @@@ you know.  So it's up to you.  I think you maybe need a little bit more time than you know, to kind of help with the therapy aspect too.  You know I can give you medication and sit with you for 30 minutes.

PATIENT X8
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X8
But as far as you going on healing and somebody says tough love @@@ that day.

PATIENT X8
Well, @@@.  A couple of these I've never refilled you know.  I think, I think there is @@@ one.

DOCTOR X8
There is.  Are you taking the triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide?  That's the blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT X8
Yes I take that and the simvastatin.  I take.

DOCTOR X8
The formoterol.  

PATIENT X8
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X8
How about.  Are you needing to do a @@@ too?

PATIENT X8
@@@.  I just never refilled it.  And then.

DOCTOR X8
And you're taking amitriptyline right?

PATIENT X8
Yes.  Uh but now @@@ more I try to @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
@@@ some of it.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.  How about, do you have to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT X8
Yes I do.  You see that's the worse thing, I get up another time, I have severe constipation.  I cut that down to just one tablet a day instead of two because I started using @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
And then ran out.

DOCTOR X8
How about the vitamin D?

PATIENT X8
@@@ constipation so I only take one.

DOCTOR X8
Okay, so you're taking it once a day or once a week?

PATIENT X8
Once a day.  I did, @@@ but I don't think, I know it was two a day but I cut it down to one a day for, due to constipation problems @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Okay.

PATIENT X8
And the ergocalciferol.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
That one I never did try I know there was that one week or a month or so, I never did try it.

DOCTOR X8
Okay.

PATIENT X8
But the rest I take.

DOCTOR X8
How long did you take ergocalciferol?

PATIENT X8
I tried to take it but I don't know, but I really didn't @@@.  I tried for once a week @@@.

DOCTOR X8
But not.

PATIENT X8
@@@.

DOCTOR X8
I can give you another vitamin D that is daily so it might be easier to @@@.

PATIENT X8
Do I really need it?  @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Well yeah so, I can tell you your vitamin D level was low the last time it was checked.

PATIENT X8
Oh I see.

DOCTOR X8
It's mildly low.  Normal is @@@.  Um so we can do nothing and recheck it or we can restart the vitamin D.  I would feel fine either way.

PATIENT X8
Well, what if you just start the @@@, folic acid.

DOCTOR X8
That's vitamin C.

PATIENT X8
That's the C.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
Okay, then the other one then was uh let me see.

DOCTOR X8
Those are the only ones that I have.

PATIENT X8
@@@.  I didn't think the D, no one a day of D.  Now this thing, these are the vitamins I was taking, I cut down to one a day.  I know one of them; the white one is the @@@ pill I take.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
I'm trying to think what they, how come the other one didn't work so good?

DOCTOR X8
Here's the problem.

PATIENT X8
Huh.

DOCTOR X8
This one?  Is it just the multivitamin?

PATIENT X8
That @@@, from the pharmacy, @@@.  Non-VA type thing.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
Yeah so that was given here.  I'm surprised it's not on the list.  I just noticed that, huh.  Cause I've been taking that for.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah but I mean the only ones that I have are folic acid, the @@@, the one you take @@@.

PATIENT X8
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X8
And uh the one for your cholesterol.

PATIENT X8
Uh-huh, yeah.  I was taking those two vitamins, @@@.  The ascorbic acid that's put in a vitamin isn't it?

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
Okay.  And the folic acid, what's the other one.

DOCTOR X8
@@@.

PATIENT X8
I'll @@@ bottle.  One is like a green that I take you know also.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.  Would, I mean you were on the vitamin D, the one that you is supposed to be takeing once a week.

PATIENT X8
One that I also take, it's always the green one there, twice a day.  I probably just need @@@.  I'm almost out of @@@ vitamin @@@.  In fact I thought it was @@@ stuff.

DOCTOR X8
It may, it may be the vitamin D that, that you take once a day.

PATIENT X8
@@@, although again those @@@ twice a day.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
But I cut them down myself.

DOCTOR X8
Okay.

PATIENT X8
I did that due to constipation.

DOCTOR X8
Well let's figure out what that was um.

PATIENT X8
Too bad I didn't bring the bottle.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
I just refilled it not long ago, so I probably just you know.

DOCTOR X8
I don't see it.  

PATIENT X8
@@@.

DOCTOR X8
So the ones that weren't refilled, were the atenolol, triamcinolone and simvastatin?

PATIENT X8
Yes @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
Must be those are the important ones.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.  Um, so let's talk about what we can do to make you feel better.

PATIENT X8
If you could do something with the sleep thing, it could really help.

DOCTOR X8
I'm not sure.  What you're telling me is that you are depressed.

PATIENT X8
Yes I am.

DOCTOR X8
And you're not sleeping is one of the main side effects of your depression.

PATIENT X8
Yep, yes.

DOCTOR X8
So we can get rid of the amitriptyline that you're taking at night and start you on a new medication.  I could send you to the Mental Health Clinic where they can follow you a little bit closer.

PATIENT X8
Ah not right now.

DOCTOR X8
Okay.

PATIENT X8
To tell you the truth, I'm you know, through my Christianity, I try to get help @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh. Yeah.

PATIENT X8
It's the mental part of it.

DOCTOR X8
I understand.

PATIENT X8
You know so.

DOCTOR X8
You know sometimes we need a little help here.

PATIENT X8
No, no, I've been told @@@ involved.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
But like doubling up on the amitriptyline @@@.

DOCTOR X8
No and to be honest amitriptyline that's probably going to help you sleep but it's not the best medicine that we have for depression.  So you do know you can try something new?

PATIENT X8
@@@ to try something and of course I look at the side effects and other things.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah that's too hard.

PATIENT X8
Well you know I hate that.  You know read those side effects, like I say @@@ my wife @@@ she had literally 12 medicines 24 hours a day.

DOCTOR X8
Hmmm.

PATIENT X8
You know, type 2 diabetes and of course dialysis @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah and that's hard.

PATIENT X8
I know a lot of those medicines.

DOCTOR X8
Dialysis is very hard I mean.

PATIENT X8
Yeah, you know two or three days in a row she'd be on it.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
It's a terrible condition.  But that's my biggest problem because I think the depression thing.  At my age @@@ you know.  I move around well.

DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
At this age, a lot of people my age you know.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
I'm grateful for that.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.  Well I think we've gotten your body in control.  Let's get your mood better.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

DOCTOR X8
And then I'll get you feeling a little bit better.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

DOCTOR X8
And you think about coming in @@@.

PATIENT X8
Okay yeah, @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Okay.  Do you want to hop up here and I can take a look.  And you don't feel like you're gonna hurt yourself?

PATIENT X8
No, that's the first thing @@@ asked me.  I'm not, yeah I know exactly what.  First thing you were told, what about @@@.  But you're not there from a religious standpoint that's wrong, no.  I've got that under control.  

(Examining patient)

DOCTOR X8
Are you moving your bowels okay?

PATIENT X8
Yes outside of those little bouts of the constipation but when I take the Docusate the over-the-counter thing, that's helping me.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.  Okay.  Are you still doing things that you enjoy?  Um.

PATIENT X8
Uh yeah.  I am very active once I stay, you know I @@@ coming over a lot and @@@.  A lot of work.

DOCTOR X8
@@@.

PATIENT X8
Yeah I move around very well @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
Well really.

DOCTOR X8
What about social clubs?

PATIENT X8
Well yeah.  I'm pretty active with the VFW and really do a lot, they have me going to conventions, helping @@@ and weekly things so.  They're pretty good, you know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X8

PATIENT X8

DOCTOR X8

PATIENT X8
Oh just one of the kids and one of my boys is gonna pick me up and we're gonna for @@@.  

DOCTOR X8

PATIENT X8

PATIENT X8

DOCTOR X8

PATIENT X8

DOCTOR X8

PATIENT X8

DOCTOR X8

PATIENT X8

DOCTOR X8

(DOCTOR OUT: 52:32  DOCTOR IN:  57:49

SECOND DOCTOR X8
(DIFFERENT VOICE male doctor)  Hi.

PATIENT X8
How are ya?

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Hello, I'm DOCTOR.  How are you doing?  What have you been up to?

PATIENT X8
Not much.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
@@@.

PATIENT X8
Well as I was telling the doc, you know @@@ on a weekly basis, pretty good and then I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
How big of family?

PATIENT X8
Oh I have six kids.  I lost one recently.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
How recently?  A year ago?  Uh how close or far away are your kids from you?

PATIENT X8
One lives around the corner.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
So you definitely @@@.  Do you have @@@.  (first doctor answers question.  You got a whole Army of people @@@.

PATIENT X8
Oh sure, no quite a few kids, even grandkids.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
So, DOCTOR tells me that you're not doing too well the insomnia, so staying awake at night.  What's happening when you're staying awake?

PATIENT X8
@@@.  You know.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Are you staying awake to pee a lot, to urinate?

PATIENT X8
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Are you staying awake because of a headache?

PATIENT X8
Heartburn.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
That's what it is.  And when was the last @@@?  And then how long were married for?  @@@.  I think that's awesome, that's terrific.  So three years ago, you know, I'm not a person to counsel you about @@@.

PATIENT X8
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
But uh, maybe @@@ but so @@@ symptoms that DOCTOR was telling me about it's just like you @@@ more like you're depressed from a mourning period @@@.

PATIENT X8
Yeah. @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
How about the amitriptyline does it help you at all?

PATIENT X8
@@@ it seems like some days it worked and other days like, I don't want to use the word over power but I'm so active @@@ it just had no effect on me.  I never fall asleep maybe 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and needless to say I wake up enumerable times.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Why is that?

PATIENT X8
I have no idea.  Maybe you know, being alone and every little noise maybe, I don't know if it's you know.  It's different when you're by yourself.  If you've got other people, you could knock the door down @@@. 

SECOND DOCTOR X8
@@@.  Are you thinking a lot.

PATIENT X8
Oh sure, oh sure.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Your mind is going over and over.

PATIENT X8
Oh sure, yeah, in the bed yeah.  

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Well there's a couple of ways to go about this.  Amitriptyline is an old drug um, really old.  Not older than us, but old enough and it work, it's @@@ when the problem is going from 25 mg to 50, it causes pretty big side effects in someone your age.  Though you're not old but @@@ it's just we're talking about two options.  One is something called Remeron or mirtazapine and with most of your symptoms are at night, it's gonna be @@@.

PATIENT X8
Yeah I would say so.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
And during the day you're out @@@ you're engaged, you're doing stuff right?

PATIENT X8
Yeah, 99% of the time.  @@@.  You know being alone doesn't help and yet I don't want to be with anybody you know.  I could be with somebody.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Well we're gonna give you some Celexa um @@@.  This medicine has properties which are helpful to help with sleep but they're not sedatives, it's not a sedative.

PATIENT X8
Well I always look at the side effects you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Oh any psychiatric medication we use for depression or for any type of psychiatric illness the side effects @@@

PATIENT X8
Well I don't want @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
But much less than the amitriptyline.  

PATIENT X8
Oh well.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
So.  Maybe try you on a low dose of Remeron or mirtazapine at night.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Take just an hour or so before you go to bed and then @@@ dose.  You might not feel any different.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
And then we're gonna increase the dose as you tolerate it and you have to talk to you, at least three times, over the next three months.

PATIENT X8
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
@@@ you have to do DOCTOR.

PATIENT X8
Oh okay, over the next three months.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
So @@@ will see our notes and @@@.  So two weeks from today, after you start the medication, we'll order to pick it up, come back and see our nurse and make sure you're doing okay.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
And the same day you come in and see the nurse, just remind her that DOCTOR and DOCTOR will come and see you and then NURSE will call you probably in a month, month and a half as well to check up on you and I want you to stop the amitriptyline.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Don't take the two together.  Sound great?

PATIENT X8
Sure, @@@, yeah sounds great.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
The other medications like Celexa, Zoloft or uh Paxil they're very good for anxiety and for daily all the time depression but they actually can keep people up at night.

PATIENT X8
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
So I think this is a safer, more @@@ approach.

PATIENT X8
Are you gonna make it @@@ . . . 

SECOND DOCTOR X8
So at times of being like clinically depressed, @@@ interacting @@@ but you definitely are telling me that three years later you should feel way.

PATIENT X8
Well my son passed too, that was, he was . . .

SECOND DOCTOR X8
That didn't help.

PATIENT X8
40 years old.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Wow, @@@.  

PATIENT X8
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Did it help?

PATIENT X8
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Alright, @@@ headaches, @@@, you aren't sleeping well, then the only thing I could do is @@@ and then if sometimes it's almost a month and it happens every year just when winter started and somebody @@@.

PATIENT X8
Now see I thought the @@@ was well qualified as an automobile mechanic, you know really feel guilty, never get a lot of association with any @@@ or carbon monoxide, that's what really threw me for a loop, @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X8
@@@ so that really.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Well I guarantee if you @@@.

PATIENT X8
But maybe if, like you say, a little at a time, @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Don't go up on it, we'll see.  Your @@@.  You @@@ a lot to me.  Well listen, we're gonna see if we can help.

PATIENT X8
Okay @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Well we never want to cause any harm so there are any problems you let us know.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X8
Alright.

PATIENT X8
I like @@@.  Not a gift.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah.

PATIENT X8
I mean, we can give that a try.

DOCTOR X8
Okay.

PATIENT X8
But that still doesn't make me happy.

DOCTOR X8
Exactly, exactly.  You know you've had a lot to deal with @@@.  Uh-huh.  I know it's hard, it doesn't seem fair.  So I want you, you know I @@@ window.

PATIENT X8
Oh go pick it up here?

DOCTOR X8
@@@ and then you can start it tonight um and like he said you may not feel the effects overnight.

PATIENT X8
Oh sure, yeah I know.

DOCTOR X8
So I want you to come back in a couple weeks and talk to the nurse, let her see how you're doing and I'll be here in two weeks too.

PATIENT X8
Uh-huh.


DOCTOR X8
Um doing the same thing you know.  I'll come say hello, talk to you, make sure she lets me know that you're here.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

DOCTOR X8
Okay.

PATIENT X8
@@@ if I have these, I don't want to this one @@@ all the time.

DOCTOR X8
We're okay.  I mean.

PATIENT X8
@@@.  Wherever it's an anniversary, @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah, well I mean any, any time you feel this way, it's a bad time.

PATIENT X8
Oh yeah.  @@@ November so, it's been bad @@@.

DOCTOR X8
Yeah, @@@ can with it.

PATIENT X8
Oh yeah, uh-huh.  @@@.

DOCTOR X8
@@@.  

PATIENT X8
@@@.

DOCTOR X8
I don't know.

PATIENT X8
@@@  I mean I was sad, it feels good, I'm a lot better than @@@.

DOCTOR X8
@@@.

PATIENT X8
Okay.

DOCTOR X8
@@@.

PATIENT X8
Sure.  @@@.

DOCTOR X8
I know.

PATIENT X8
That's good.

DOCTOR X8
Alright, we'll just have you come back in two weeks and then you know after I talk to you in a couple of weeks, if I feel like you're doing well then you can go up on the dose and I'll keep in touch with you.

PATIENT X8
Yeah, no I'll be fine.

DOCTOR X8
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X8
Thank you so much.  

DOCTOR X8
Take care okay.

PATIENT X8

DOCTOR X478
Hi PATIENT, how you doing?

PATIENT X478
Okay and you?

DOCTOR X478
We haven't seen you in a while.

PATIENT X478
No you haven't.

DOCTOR X478
I wonder how long it's been since we've seen you um oh January.  Oh my God, has it really been that long?

PATIENT X478
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X478
No May 30th, yeah.

PATIENT X478
I was gonna say, I thinking it was a little sooner than that.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah that was since you saw me, @@@.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
@@@.

PATIENT X478
Oh that's what happened, you had a baby.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah the middle of May.

PATIENT X478
Oh I bet you're glad to be back to work.

DOCTOR X478
Well, I've been back to work for a long time now.  Okay, so let's take a look.  I saw you in May.

PATIENT X478
Girl or boy?

DOCTOR X478
Girl.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
Alright uh we talked about some.

PATIENT X478
Congratulations.

DOCTOR X478
Thank you.

PATIENT X478
@@@.

DOCTOR X478
But that's been a while @@@.  Um we were talking about some of these seizures.

PATIENT X478
Yes and they started to get a little worse actually.

DOCTOR X478
Alright so the problem with your seizures is that it looks like um let's see Neurology it looks like Neurology saw you since I last saw you.

PATIENT X478
Yes they have seen me.

DOCTOR X478
They're just saying you did an EEG @@@ but you tell me that you feel like you're having seizures.

PATIENT X478
I don't feel like I'm having seizures, I am having seizures.

DOCTOR X478
Neurology follow-up.  You saw Neurology earlier?

PATIENT X478
Uh-huh.  If that bolt of light that I'm seeing is called a seizure, then I'm having seizures.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.  So you're having these bursts of light.

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

DOCTOR X478
They increased the topiramate to 200 right?

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

DOCTOR X478
And then they sent you to the Eye Clinic, they did an MRI, imaging, MRI.

PATIENT X478
That burst of light is a seizure right?

DOCTOR X478
Uh you can also get those with headaches.  People can have headaches that will do that too.  Complex headaches could do that definitely.  So your MRI looks pretty normal.  Your MRI of your brain.

PATIENT X478
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X478
Looks essentially normal and the Eye Clinic saw you.

PATIENT X478
My MRI was normal?

DOCTOR X478
It's essentially normal yeah.  I mean it shows sinus congestion, some sinusitis in your sinuses but they didn't see anything uh @@@ of your brain.  Now the test was only meant to look at the blood vessels in your brain.  That's what it was looking for and it said that your brain is getting sufficient blood in all the areas so that's good.  We don't want it to be abnormal.

PATIENT X478
No I don't anything to be abnormal.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah and then they sent you to the Eye Clinic but it doesn't look like you've seen them yet.

PATIENT X478
Yeah I seen the Eye Clinic.

DOCTOR X478
Like since they sent you in February?

PATIENT X478
Yeah I just came from the Eye Clinic.

DOCTOR X478
Right now?

PATIENT X478
No.

DOCTOR X478
Um.

PATIENT X478
I just.

DOCTOR X478
I'm just checking this out sorry.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
Looks like the last time you saw an Eye Clinic was December 26, 2008.

PATIENT X478
No I've been since then.

DOCTOR X478
You have, let me see, there's the Eye December 26th note, Optometry, February 25th, alright.

PATIENT X478
Right.

DOCTOR X478
Uh for Eye Clinic right, I just clicked this @@@ to get the results.

PATIENT X478
Right.  Well they didn't see anything that was abnormal.

DOCTOR X478
@@@, mild cataracts.

PATIENT X478
I have mild cataracts?

DOCTOR X478
Mild cataracts.

PATIENT X478
Oh great, that's all I need is to get a cataract.

DOCTOR X478
@@@.  They found the cataracts.  They found something but they didn't find the reason for why you have the flashing light.

PATIENT X478
No.

DOCTOR X478
And they said you need to go back to Neurology @@@.  But you still been looking at, are you still having the flashing lights?

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

DOCTOR X478
How often?

PATIENT X478
I have them at least, even with the medication of going up 200.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
I still have them maybe three or four times a day.

DOCTOR X478
Really?  Uh do you kind feel like you get confused at all when you have them?

PATIENT X478
I don't lose consciousness but it causes the confusion.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478
And it causes me to, it blinds me.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  With just one eye or both eyes?

PATIENT X478
Both eyes.  I lose complete sight.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
And I have total blackness.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478
For at least three or four seconds after the burst of light.

DOCTOR X478
Hmm.

PATIENT X478
They took away my driver's license because of it.

DOCTOR X478
I'm not surprised.  @@@.

PATIENT X478
And now you're trying to tell me that nothing is wrong.

DOCTOR X478
Well I can tell you; all I can tell you is that the specialists have seen you about this issue.  Your neurologist and eye specialists haven't found, it doesn't mean you have nothing wrong we just haven't found that which is wrong yet okay.  Now there are things called complex headaches that can actually have flashing lights associated with them so with your neurologist is aware of that and that would be a big help if they knew what's going on.

PATIENT X478
Okay.  I'm telling you, this isn't headaches because there are times.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
When I shake so bad I can't even hold a glass of water in my hand.  But I see, I was sitting up at a restaurant.

DOCTOR X478
Is it one arm or one that's always happening, just any arm?

PATIENT X478
It's usually on the left side because I'm left-handed.

DOCTOR X478
Both arms?

PATIENT X478
I'll be sitting up in a restaurant eating.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
And people will be looking at me because I'm shaking like I'm an old drunk.  They think I'm old drunk.

DOCTOR X478
I see.

PATIENT X478
Because I shake like an old drunk.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  Yeah I understand.

PATIENT X478
I'm having some type of neurologic.

DOCTOR X478
Neurologic problem.

PATIENT X478
It's something.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  I wish I could tell you the answer but of all people, I'm not your neurologist.

PATIENT X478
I understand that.

DOCTOR X478
I know.  I understand it's really frustrating @@@ and you're not scheduled to see the neurologist again for a while are you?

PATIENT X478
No not yet.

DOCTOR X478
So they saw you in February and they wanted to see you, actually they wanted to see you this month.  They said come back in March @@@.

PATIENT X478
Okay.  I'll have to call and make an appointment.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah they want you to come so.

PATIENT X478
This is not in my head, trust me.

DOCTOR X478
I understand and I completely, I understand this is not something you're imagining.

PATIENT X478
Even with the increase in medications.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
The increase, I know the medication is helping.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
But it's not erasing the problem.

DOCTOR X478
I see.  Did you notice less of it after they increased the medication?

PATIENT X478
It's less because I was having about 20 of these a day.

DOCTOR X478
Oh I see.

PATIENT X478
So it helps.

DOCTOR X478
Right.

PATIENT X478
But it's not curing the problem right.

DOCTOR X478
Is that the only seizure medicine you're on?

PATIENT X478
That's the only seizure medication I'm on yes.

DOCTOR X478
So we may even need to put you on two seizure medicines.  Some people actually, you know statistically only 2/3 of the people who have seizures get controlled with one medicine.  You need, many people require two medicines to get control of their seizures and it's very, very common if people need more than one medicine.  So it's not you, it's not that the drug is bad it's that seizures are difficult to control with one medicine.

PATIENT X478
Okay.  As long as you understand that the medication has side effects on its own.

DOCTOR X478
The side effects, all medicines do have side effects @@@.

PATIENT X478
One of them is the impotency.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478
And you have like, I had weird sensations down my arms and legs, like a weird type of tingling sensation.

DOCTOR X478
Tingling sensation okay.  So that's on your left side?

PATIENT X478
Well I don't think it's just down my left side, it's on both sides but I've noticed it more on my left because I'm left-handed.  I use my left arm.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
And I use my left side more.  Especially since after the operation on my arm.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
My arm is a lot better.

DOCTOR X478
I see that's good, something's better.

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

DOCTOR X478
That's good.

PATIENT X478
Right that is good.  Because now I can actually use my arm again.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  That's good then, also I'm just going through your last labs to make sure that we.

PATIENT X478
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X478
Have everything.  Now your cholesterol was still too high.

PATIENT X478
Cholesterol is still high yeah.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah.  You have, I saw you in May of 09 and last year it's still @@@.  Yeah this was @@@.  Oh we haven't actually @@@ your cholesterol @@@.

PATIENT X478
I just had some type of test back in.

DOCTOR X478
That could be in February.

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

DOCTOR X478
That could be your neurologist sent you for blood tests but they only checked like two blood, I mean they only literally checked two numbers.

PATIENT X478
Why?  Why didn't do the full thing?  Why did they do it?

DOCTOR X478
I don't think.  I don't know.  Usually it's better to just order everything just so you have to get it done.

PATIENT X478
Well why didn't they?

DOCTOR X478
I don't know.  They only ordered two tests which are useful that I need but the last time you had a full set of tests was @@@ 8.

PATIENT X478
Yeah.  I mean if they're gonna do that, why only order two?

DOCTOR X478
Yeah I think, @@@ check something um, yeah I ordered labs on you in May.  I ordered a couple of things on you in May so the work @@@.  Okay.  Some of these are from 07.  Let me just check a couple of these things.  You've got orders in here from 2007, there you go.

PATIENT X478
@@@.

DOCTOR X478
And nobody's going to @@@ though I @@@ you have orders.

PATIENT X478
No, why there's no reason for all that.

DOCTOR X478
I agree.

PATIENT X478
I think that causes people to get confused when they look at all that.  All those @@@ and nobody cleans all that up and they @@@.

DOCTOR X478
I'll take care it.

PATIENT X478
Yeah, please do.

DOCTOR X478
@@@ there you go.  All cleaned.  So we'll just start from scratch okay.  We'll get fresh labs for this year, for you today.

PATIENT X478
Right.  You can't do it today because my ride is going to be here at 4:30.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.  So are coming back to the VA?  It looks like March 25th you've got an appointment @@@.

PATIENT X478
Yeah but that's from my, I have a weekly appointment here.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478
And that's all @@@.

DOCTOR X478
Well if you're gonna be here, we could draw the labs then.  If you're gonna be at the VA you could still have labs done that day.

PATIENT X478
Well, actually that's not a good time.  Actually on Thursday.  Can we do it on a different day?

DOCTOR X478
Well you could do it any day you want.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
Just remember to come in whenever you want.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
It could be any day you're gonna be here.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
@@@.  Um just any time before our next visit would be good.

PATIENT X478
When will my next visit be?

DOCTOR X478
You can @@@ we'll see you probably in a couple of months for your blood pressure and cholesterol and things like that.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
Depending on how well controlled.  Your blood pressure is real good today, 110/64.  Which is really good.

PATIENT X478
That's really surprising.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
Surprising.  I wasn't in such a good mood by the time they get that.

DOCTOR X478
Well your mood is going to go up depending on what you do with your blood pressure.

PATIENT X478
I'm glad to hear that.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
I really am.

DOCTOR X478
And so your blood pressure's good and you're taking the prostate medicine with the prostate to help you pee easier.

PATIENT X478
Yes.

DOCTOR X478
And that actually also helps control the blood pressure too, that medicine so.

PATIENT X478
I'm glad to hear that.

DOCTOR X478
So @@@.

PATIENT X478
Because I don't need any of those right now but uh the one for, the sexual problem.

DOCTOR X478
Oh the Cialis.

PATIENT X478
Can I have a refill on that?

DOCTOR X478
Sure, you @@@.  And you should have ten refills on that one.

PATIENT X478
@@@.

DOCTOR X478
@@@.

PATIENT X478
Cause one of them was coming automatically and then all of a sudden it just stopped.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah but they're supposed to be mailed.

PATIENT X478
Well nobody's mailed anything in the last two months so.

DOCTOR X478
So I just resent the prescription so they should send you three @@@.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
It's um, it has refills on it.

PATIENT X478
That's why I don't understand why they stopped.

DOCTOR X478
I don't know.  So we have a lot of people who to the VA where it's coming and all of a sudden it stops.

PATIENT X478
It stopped.

DOCTOR X478
We don't know what happens.  Uh and then let's try.

PATIENT X478
And I made a refill for the, the seizure medication.

DOCTOR X478
Oh actually that's diclofenac, you have six refills on that.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
You can actually go to the Pharmacy and pick it up.

PATIENT X478
Well I can't today cause my ride's gonna be here in a little bit.

DOCTOR X478
So they haven't sent it to you?

PATIENT X478
Huh?

DOCTOR X478
They haven't sent it to you?

PATIENT X478
No.  That's what I'm saying, I just think it stopped.  I wanted Neurology to just.

DOCTOR X478
So I could put it in here, I mean whatever you need; I'll reinsert it to make sure that this.

PATIENT X478
Yeah would you?

DOCTOR X478
That it @@@ back in but um, you have six refills on that one.

PATIENT X478
Yeah.  That's why I don't understand why they just stopped.

DOCTOR X478
I don't know.

PATIENT X478
Cause I know my refills were active.  I don't understand why it just stopped.

DOCTOR X478
Right.  I just don't know.  Um and it looks like you have colon cancer in the family.

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

DOCTOR X478
You got a colonoscopy two years ago.

PATIENT X478
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X478
And you were just @@@.

PATIENT X478
As a matter of fact they just removed a polyp in November.

DOCTOR X478
They did go in and do an endoscopy?

PATIENT X478
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X478
Um and when do they want to see you again?

PATIENT X478
Uh, I don't know.  Things got kind of messed up after that.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.  November uh.

PATIENT X478
I don't think there were any problems with it.  They said it was really, really small so.

DOCTOR X478
And then.

PATIENT X478
They didn't give me a date to come back though.

DOCTOR X478
Did they, after you had the procedure, did you see the stomach specialist afterwards?

PATIENT X478
No.

DOCTOR X478
Because when they did the procedure in November they wrote in their notes they wanted to see you in four weeks to review the results.

PATIENT X478
Okay and then they cancelled the appointment.

DOCTOR X478
Oh is that what happened?

PATIENT X478
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X478
Uh Gastroenterology consult and @@@.  So let's take a look at the results then uh @@@ checking the colon okay.  So they did a biopsy, looks like they found a little ulcer when they did the test, when they did the scope.  It looks like they found a little ulcer and then they did the biopsy of that and it looks like what it says, sometimes when people take a lot of nonsteroidal medicines like ibuprofen, Motrin, Naprosyn, things like that, it can damage the lining of their stomach.  Usually it happens in the stomach uh; however, I know sometimes maybe it can happen further down like in the colon and the rectum so the results of this says that there's a little ulcer, maybe it's related to somebody who takes a lot of these medicines but I don't think you do.  You don't take a lot of Motrin or ibuprofen.

PATIENT X478
Well I was then because of the uh, the shoulder.

DOCTOR X478
So you were.  So if you @@@ like there was a little ulcer, @@@ stomach ulcer.

PATIENT X478
Right.

DOCTOR X478
I personally never heard of anybody having ulcers in the colon from @@@ because they have similar linings but I don't see why not, it's probably very plausible.  Uh versus areas of poor blood flow and I don't think that pattern.  So the important thing is that uh something that uh the stomach doctors initially wanted to see you in four weeks to discuss these results and this is @@@ for your health because I @@@ ulcers in the colon because @@@.  Uh so let's see if we can get you to see them for a follow-up okay.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
And see when, if they want to see you again, how often they want to follow you up regarding that.  Uh @@@.

PATIENT X478
Well what are you saying; I've got like an ulcer in my colon?

DOCTOR X478
Yeah they saw, sometimes people will have uh ulcers in their stomachs and sometimes they'll have ulcers in their colon.  I've never, uh I wasn't there when they were doing a colonoscopy and I don't know if it was a tiny piece of @@@ biopsies or if it was something bigger, so @@@ see the doctor who took care of it because they're the ones who give you the follow-up @@@.  So I could tell you that what the report says it could be @@@.  So let's, uh it's not cancer.  Most importantly it's not cancer which is why we do the test and why you were checked because you had a family history of colon cancer.

PATIENT X478
Right.

DOCTOR X478
And so it's not cancer but to completely explain to you the results of it, I think the GI doctors should do that.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.  So @@@.  Okay so we'll send you to @@@.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

DOCTOR X478
And Neurology wanted to see you this month as well, let me put this in.

PATIENT X478
Right.

DOCTOR X478
Um and we can only do certain clinics.  We can't do all clinics here.

PATIENT X478
Right.

DOCTOR X478
Uh we can do many of them, but I don't think Neurology is in there, I don't think we can do the Neurology Clinic.

PATIENT X478
Right.

DOCTOR X478
Um and then let me check this note okay.  Okay, let's listen to your heart and lungs.  Can you take off your jacket and your shirt?

PATIENT X478
@@@.

DOCTOR X478
What do you need?

PATIENT X478
@@@.

DOCTOR X478
@@@.

PATIENT X478
Well not with but you know, some of the people that I know, I @@@.

DOCTOR X478
Right, well let's find it, let's try to find it.

PATIENT X478
Hmm.

DOCTOR X478
Let's see, you don't need @@@.

PATIENT X478
Oh.

DOCTOR X478
I sent @@@.

PATIENT X478
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
@@@.

DOCTOR X478
Take some deep breaths for me.  One more, one more, one more.  Breathe normally.  Uh I can definitely here it, that's good.

PATIENT X478
Oh good.  Oh I know what else I need you to fill out.

DOCTOR X478
Yes.

PATIENT X478
On my uh.

DOCTOR X478
Your inhaler?

PATIENT X478
Yes.

DOCTOR X478
Were you using the inhaler?

PATIENT X478
I need the one.

DOCTOR X478
What do you need one for?

PATIENT X478
Uh bronchitis.

DOCTOR X478
Bronchitis.

PATIENT X478
I have the one with the orange top but I can't.

DOCTOR X478
Well @@@ for a while because I don't see any recent prescriptions.

PATIENT X478
Now I just got one in January.

DOCTOR X478
Let me see @@@.  Okay.  I'll put some refills on that.

PATIENT X478
They should be sending it to me automatically.

DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
@@@.

DOCTOR X478
@@@.

PATIENT X478
I'll need the capsules too.

DOCTOR X478
The mometasone capsules?

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

DOCTOR X478
You have like 11 refills on that.

PATIENT X478
Well then why did they stop coming then?

DOCTOR X478
I don't know.  I can't tell you that.

PATIENT X478
Well I have refills too.

DOCTOR X478
Okay.  I'll order it.  I'll be back in just a couple minutes okay.

PATIENT X478
Okay, thank you.

DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
I have the pills, they just stopped coming.

DOCTOR X478
I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  146:30  DOCTOR IN:  155:00)

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Hello.

PATIENT X478
Oh right here.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT X478
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
You're taking medicine for your prostate?

FIRST DOCTOR X478
@@@.

PATIENT X478
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Yeah do you think that's working?

PATIENT X478
Yes it is working.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  Were you on @@@ or was that the first month on this?

PATIENT X478
Well I was on a higher dose but then it worked like too well so we went back to the regular dose.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  Were you ever on a low dose @@@?

PATIENT X478
Well uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Did you take it and then it didn't work @@@?

PATIENT X478
No uh, this is uh 5 mg, I was on, they put me on 10 but it was like it worked too well.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
I see.

PATIENT X478
So they put me back on 5 again.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  Tell me about the flashing lights you see.

PATIENT X478
Okay.  It's like; it's like a flash of a camera before your eyes.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
It blinds me for about three or four seconds.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Do they move around or the?

PATIENT X478
What do you mean do they move around?

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Well do they move, does the light like moving or is it just like?

PATIENT X478
No it, you get an effect that goes from like from right to left but you, it flashes before your eyes that it blinds you.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
How long?

PATIENT X478
About three or four seconds.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
You say it goes white or it goes black?

PATIENT X478
It goes black.  Just like the flash, you get the aftermath like if you flash a camera before your eyes, like you get that flash.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh, sort of like if someone flashed a camera right in your face and you can't see.

PATIENT X478
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
@@@.

PATIENT X478
Right.  It lasts about three or four seconds and then it's over.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
So when you're actually seeing it, it will be black, not white.

PATIENT X478
No it's not white, it's black.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.  So you can't, so when you see there's nothing.

PATIENT X478
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
It's nothing moving around?

PATIENT X478
No you see nothing.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
And then it comes back.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
And when does that happen?

PATIENT X478
It can happen at any time.  I can just be sitting up in bed watching TV or reading a book or anything.  It's not a specific thing that I'm doing.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Do you think this probably happens in the mornings?

PATIENT X478
Uh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
When?

PATIENT X478
I can't give you a specific time as to when.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Last year, last month?

PATIENT X478
Uh probably about three or four months ago.  

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478
It's happened before but it's gotten more regular before but I was taking medication and that brought it back to there.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh, so it's getting better with the medicines.

PATIENT X478
Yeah it is better with the medication.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay.  So that prostate medicine, did that make it worse you think?

PATIENT X478
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
@@@ anything.  When you started the @@@ were you having it?

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
You were still having those things before you started it?

PATIENT X478
I had it before I started the medications.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
And was it the same?  @@@.

PATIENT X478

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478

(DOCTORS VISIT BETWEEN THEMSELVES REGARDING PATIENT'S TREATMENT)

PATIENT X478
When these first started.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
I had to tell them that I was having seizures.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Yeah.

PATIENT X478
I've had two.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Right.

PATIENT X478
I mean I said real @@@ seizures cause I tried to tell them that I was having seizures for about two or three years before they actually even looked at the fact that I was having seizures, they ain't doing @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
But this doesn't sound like a seizure to me.

PATIENT X478
Okay but I can't see.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
I understand that.

PATIENT X478
Okay.  I tried to tell them that I was having seizures and they didn't do anything.  Then I was in uh, with DOCTOR one day and he told me I was having a seizure and that's when they actually started giving me seizure medication.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X478
And I was on a different type of seizure medication and they actually didn't do anything.  They didn't really, it helped but it didn't really help.  It was like Depakote.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Oh okay.

PATIENT X478
And then they gave me another different type of seizure medication and that didn't do anything either and then they tried to give me this type of medication and it actually helped.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Well we can change medicines around to see other seizure medicines but we should also get @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X478
An MRI was just done.

PATIENT X478
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X478

PATIENT X478
They were telling me that they didn't see anything.

FIRST DOCTOR X478
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X478

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay, well that shouldn't.

PATIENT X478
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay.  Um alright.

PATIENT X478
But they're telling me that my MRI looked normal.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Good.  Good.  @@@.

PATIENT X478
I'm not, I'm not trying to tell them that they're wrong or anything but I'm telling them because sometimes people will be talking to me, I can hear it.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Right.

PATIENT X478
But it's like I'm in Never Never Land, I can't answer them or I can't respond to them and I have like uh, a neuropathy, it's like some type of repetitive movement that I can't stop.  Like some type of.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478
It's hard to explain, you'd have to see me when I do it and I have this strange shake.  I shake so bad sometimes I couldn't even hold a glass of water.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay.

PATIENT X478
And I even, when I eat, it's the same thing.  Again.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Well I think we, it sounds like.

PATIENT X478
It's some type of neurological.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Well whatever it is now, you're having less seizures so it's not something I mean I'm just trying to say that each, it's still a problem.

PATIENT X478
I'm not saying that it's not normal people.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Yes.

PATIENT X478
I'm just saying uh what they're saying to do with it would not, doesn't seem like we're going about it at the right rate for some reason or another.

SECOND DOCTOR X478
Okay.  So let's see if we can just run through the medication.  You're on Depakote?

PATIENT X478
No I'm on.

SECOND DOCTOR X478

SECOND DOCTOR X478

SECOND DOCTOR X478

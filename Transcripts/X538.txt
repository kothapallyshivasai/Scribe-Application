What about that one, they once give me four pills and that's really to regulate that funny heartbeat I supposed to have.  It's called a monotone or something.

FIRST DOCTOR X538
Amiodarone.

PATIENT X538
Amiodarone yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X538
Is that it?

PATIENT X538
And he wouldn't give me enough he gave me two, all the other doctors they give it to me, now he won't give it to me.

FIRST DOCTOR X538
Who prescribed you that, I don't see it in here?

PATIENT X538
Well it came, really actually from xxx again.

FIRST DOCTOR X538
Oh, oh.

PATIENT X538
But the heart doctors preferred that I have it, do I need it?

FIRST DOCTOR X538
If you're not having an irregular heart beat I don't think you need it.  But this is a good thing because you're gonna see the cardiologist within a couple days.

PATIENT X538
Yeah.

DOCTOR X538
So when you see them, they're the guys that really know about the amiodarone, they know about the heart more, they're the heart docs so if they wanted they can assess if you need it.

PATIENT X538
So in other words don't mess with it until I.

DOCTOR X538
Don't mess it until you've seen the cardiologist.

PATIENT X538
Cause he was saying something about it's a dangerous drug or something.

DOCTOR X538

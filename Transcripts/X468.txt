DOCTOR X468
PATIENT?

PATIENT X468
Yo.

DOCTOR X468
@@@.  

PATIENT X468
It never fails, whatever side I sit on the doctor come out the other side.  

DOCTOR X468
How are you doing today?

PATIENT X468
Well I'm not so good.

DOCTOR X468
We can talk about it.

PATIENT X468
Okay.  I got it.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X468
Put my stuff over here?

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  What's going on?

PATIENT X468
Well, it's to be expected.  I have cancer of both lungs.

DOCTOR X468
Right.

PATIENT X468
And I'm on chemo.

DOCTOR X468
Right.

PATIENT X468
So there gonna be some good days and some bad days.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.

PATIENT X468
This would be one of my bad days you know, a little dizzy but no pain or anything like that.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.

PATIENT X468
I'm not falling down dizzy you know.

DOCTOR X468
Do you feel.

PATIENT X468
Sort of like you feel after you have three shots you know.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  I think that, I was just looking through your chart.  I think we can stop one of your blood pressure medicines.  So the blood pressure is pretty well, has it ever been high since we started the chemo?

PATIENT X468
Uh no.  In fact, a couple of times.

DOCTOR X468
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X468
It has, you know its hit bottom.

DOCTOR X468
Right.

PATIENT X468
Has been in the 90s.

DOCTOR X468
In the 90s yeah.

PATIENT X468
Yeah.

DOCTOR X468
I think we should, if it's alright with you, try stopping the blood pressure medicine, the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X468
Oh that's the little yellow pill.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
It makes you get up sometime at night.

DOCTOR X468
The water pill right.

PATIENT X468
Right.

DOCTOR X468
Um I'll talk with DOCTOR but I think and that'll help you from being, so you were losing water by taking that and so.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
That causes some dizziness and some low blood pressures.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
But maybe we could try.

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
Cause I don't think you need it anymore.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
For a long period, as long as my blood pressure been down.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
Yeah.

DOCTOR X468
It's going, let me just check and see.

PATIENT X468
Well I feel, well I still have my nifedipine.

DOCTOR X468
You still have the nifedipine?

PATIENT X468
Yeah.

DOCTOR X468
What's that uh, let's see.  How much of that are you taking?

PATIENT X468
Thought it was 90 right?

DOCTOR X468
Right, it's 90.

PATIENT X468
90 mg.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.  Let's talk with DOCTOR.  I think we should go down on one of these blood pressure medicines.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
Either the nifedipine we can, since that's a pretty strong dose maybe we could just cut it to 60 instead of 90.

PATIENT X468
Hey good.

DOCTOR X468
Or we could get rid of the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X468
Completely.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
Until further notice.

DOCTOR X468
Right, right.

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
I'll, I'll talk to him and see what he thinks is the.

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
Better thing to do.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X468
Uh no.

DOCTOR X468
No.

PATIENT X468
Uh.

DOCTOR X468
Any trouble breathing?

PATIENT X468
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X468
Just the dizziness.

PATIENT X468
Yes, you know just the dizziness.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.

PATIENT X468
I was dizzy.  @@@.

DOCTOR X468
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X468
I had chemo three weeks ago.

DOCTOR X468
Right.

PATIENT X468
And right after you know, the body said hey what's this you giving me.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
And uh and I been doing pretty good you know.  I no longer getting the blood-streaked sputum you know.

DOCTOR X468
That's good.

PATIENT X468
I hope it is.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  And then did they talk to you about how many cycles of chemo you have to get or?

PATIENT X468
Uh right now they said, not to hold them to it, it all depends on the tests they take.

DOCTOR X468
How you're doing.

PATIENT X468
And what have you but they said approximately.

DOCTOR X468
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X468
Six three weeks apart.

DOCTOR X468
Three weeks apart each one.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  You're going good.

PATIENT X468
Well I'm hanging in there.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  So do you live with anyone then or?

PATIENT X468
Huh?

DOCTOR X468
Do you live by yourself or do you have someone to kind of help you out?

PATIENT X468
Uh I live in a building with 150 apartments.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.

PATIENT X468
And uh.

DOCTOR X468
Your neighbors are pretty nice?

PATIENT X468
I know people and sometimes they come in.  Once you get past 75 you can, you know the neighbors you know.  So they always want to know where you been and all that and you know when you came out, those type of neighbors.  Pretty @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X468
Right, right.  So nobody stays like with you in the house though?

PATIENT X468
Uh no.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.  Do you that, would you like to if I could get it set up that a visiting nurse come by and just check on you @@@?  Just so you know if you need anything you know she could help get it.  I'll have to see if I can get that set up but you probably would qualify if you think that would help you.

PATIENT X468
Oh BNA?

DOCTOR X468
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X468
Yeah.  Okay.

DOCTOR X468
Do you have that already or?

PATIENT X468
No.

DOCTOR X468
No okay, yeah.  I think it might be helpful at this point in time.

PATIENT X468
I believe it is.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  I'll see if I can get that set up.

PATIENT X468
Oh she can make suggestions you know.

DOCTOR X468
Sure, yeah.

PATIENT X468
You know maybe you should go to the hospital.

DOCTOR X468
Exactly.

PATIENT X468
You know.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
Lighten up on the crown or you know things like that.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X468
But I think it'd be a good idea.

DOCTOR X468
I think so too.  I'll see if I can, it'll take a while for it to get to but.

PATIENT X468
I know.

DOCTOR X468
But we'll get that started and um did you need any refills on any medications or anything?

PATIENT X468
Well, if he cut the hydrochlorothiazide to say 60.

DOCTOR X468
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X468
I mean to @@@ the nifedipine to say 60, I would need to get that refilled so I don't take the old 90 mg.

DOCTOR X468
Sure.  We will uh.

PATIENT X468
And only hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg would probably lower the cost.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  Well I'll ask him and see which one is better to do.

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
So.

PATIENT X468
Okay.  Yeah he's a good man.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah I mean either one is probably fine so.  I'll ask him.  Let me just take a listen to you and you want to sit up here okay?

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
@@@ oh you can finish your coffee.

PATIENT X468
Of course.  I'm gonna be here all day.

DOCTOR X468
Oh yeah, you have something else today?

PATIENT X468

PATIENT X468

DOCTOR X468
When was the last time you've seen the dentist?

PATIENT X468
You know I like the way you do things.  Oh about ten years ago.

DOCTOR X468
And do you have trouble eating or anything?

PATIENT X468
Uh no I eat soft food you know.

DOCTOR X468
You eat soft food.

PATIENT X468
And uh, according how this chemical thing works out you know if the process should go in remission or something then I worry about the teeth.

DOCTOR X468
Sure, no I understand.  That's more important right now.

PATIENT X468
Yeah.  So why worry about uh.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
Putting dentures in the gun.

DOCTOR X468
Deep breath for me.  Good, good.  Did they tell you had @@@ cause I don't hear anything.

PATIENT X468
I'm gonna ask you a question doctor.

DOCTOR X468
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X468
See my feet.

DOCTOR X468
Yes.

PATIENT X468
They are so colonized like the raptor.

DOCTOR X468

PATIENT X468
A raptor, a bird of prey.

DOCTOR X468
Oh sure.

PATIENT X468
You know.

DOCTOR X468
You mean just like how it's like @@@.

PATIENT X468
No it's @@@.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah you know that's kind of uh one of the signs of, it's called clubbing.  Has anybody told you that?

PATIENT X468
No. 

DOCTOR X468
It's like um, it'll happen for a lot of different reasons.  Two of the most common ones are when people smoke a lot.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
They can get discolored like the bottom side @@@.

PATIENT X468
@@@ very much.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah its part and usually when that happens it's because people smoke a lot and then you worry about cancer, so the cancer causes the problem.

PATIENT X468
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X468
So it's uh nothing, we can't really do anything to change it.  You could just um you know clip your nails but they don't look that long I mean.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.  I clipped them last night.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah so but yeah it's just part of the.

PATIENT X468
Part of the, part of the situation.

DOCTOR X468
Right, right.  

PATIENT X468
I have a power port on the right side.

DOCTOR X468
Now what is it?

PATIENT X468
A power port.

DOCTOR X468
Oh power port, yeah I wanted to ask you where you get your chemo from.  Okay so yeah it didn't hurt to see it.

PATIENT X468
Huh.

DOCTOR X468
Looks good.  I'm just checking with you.  

PATIENT X468
Yeah okay, no problem.

DOCTOR X468
Everything looks great.  Let's see.  Good.  Just lay down for me and I'm gonna take a look at your feet @@@.

PATIENT X468
My skin is dry.  Always has sort of a crustiness of it.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.  You put any lotion or anything on it?

PATIENT X468
Up until the last couple of days.  When I'm coming to the doctor I don't put any lotion on the day before that.

DOCTOR X468
I see.

PATIENT X468
So I can be more natural.

DOCTOR X468
I don't know, does that hurt you when I do that?

PATIENT X468
Uh no.

DOCTOR X468
Okay great, good.  Yeah that should, you should put some lotion on it.

PATIENT X468
And I wouldn't do that generally as a man.

DOCTOR X468
Oh I know.

PATIENT X468
My feet are not so.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
They just big.

DOCTOR X468

PATIENT X468
Oh uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
Alright, you can have a seat back there.

PATIENT X468
Alright.

DOCTOR X468
Alright, let me go talk to DOCTOR.  I think the main thing today is to kind of go down a little bit on your blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
And then everything else looks alright.

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
Okay let me just go talk to him okay.

DOCTOR X468

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.  

DOCTOR X468
I think so; I don't know that much about those things.  @@@.

PATIENT X468
That's the end of the world you know.

DOCTOR X468
That's right I remember you telling me that last time.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh on the Mayan calendar.

DOCTOR X468
The way you look right now I think you'll make it.

PATIENT X468
Yeah I'm gaining a few pounds and I was you know hoping that wasn't permanent because.

DOCTOR X468
I understand you.

PATIENT X468
On this procedure they don't want you to bloat up.

DOCTOR X468
Right, right.

PATIENT X468
You know, it good to gain a few pound but you start bloating up and swelling in the feet and all that.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
It's not good.  Okay doc.

DOCTOR X468
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:09  DOCTOR IN:  51:42)

(Knock on the door)

PATIENT X468
Come on.

DOCTOR X468
He said to just cut out the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X468
Okay.

DOCTOR X468
To keep the nifedipine at the 90.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
Um and cut out the @@@.

PATIENT X468
The lisinopril okay.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X468
So we remove more pills.

DOCTOR X468
Right.  Right and if your blood pressure goes high you can start taking it again but I don't think it's gonna go high right so.  Alright and then I'll put in for the nursing to come visit you and that could get set-up over the next couple of weeks okay.

PATIENT X468
Uh okay.  They've got my phone number right?

DOCTOR X468

DOCTOR X468
NUMBER okay, sounds good.

PATIENT X468
Would you check one thing else for me?

DOCTOR X468
Uh-huh.  What's that?

PATIENT X468
Uh when I was in the GU Clinic three weeks ago.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
They took a PSA on me.

DOCTOR X468
It was 6.12, so it's good.  You just having @@@.

PATIENT X468
Cause it had jumped from 4 to 6.

DOCTOR X468
You know that's uh, yeah 4 to 6 but it's been 6 before in like 2008, it was 6.47.

PATIENT X468
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X468
And it was like 5 in May.  It kind of jumps around you know, that's not a big difference.  What you worry about is if it goes up by a lot, like if it doubles or triples.

PATIENT X468
Or keeps inching up.

DOCTOR X468
Yeah.

PATIENT X468
You know each time a little worse okay.

DOCTOR X468
Okay.

PATIENT X468
Cause I was just wondering about that.

DOCTOR X468

PATIENT X468
I was in the GU, he seemed pretty, oh your PSA was 6, that's not good, okay.

DOCTOR X468
Oh it's not the, it's not anything to worry about.

PATIENT X468

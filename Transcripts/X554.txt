PATIENT X554
Yeah I get away from it.  I get away from it and it's like I'm going to do this month, it's all @@@ I just, I don't know.  I have like uh. What I say aggressive thoughts.

DOCTOR X554
Did you get the flu shot today?

PATIENT X554
No I don't do that stuff no.

DOCTOR X554

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X554
Yeah I need all my medicine.

DOCTOR X554
Let me just check your blood pressure medication, you're taking the amlodipine and the hydrochlorothiazide?  Oh @@@.

PATIENT X554
Well those are all good.  It's probably @@@ cause I hadn't nothing for so long.

DOCTOR X554

PATIENT X554
No nothing today, uh uh.

DOCTOR X554
I put them in last time @@@ right.

PATIENT X554

DOCTOR X554
We can keep an eye on it.  Um how's your diet?

PATIENT X554
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X554
So how about the, feeling depressed do you think it's because of the same colonoscopy thing or it's something else?

PATIENT X554
I think it's that.

DOCTOR X554
So is it depression or is it anxiety?

PATIENT X554
Well I think its depression because.

DOCTOR X554
Why are you depressed?

PATIENT X554
Because I'm just, I have a brother with colon cancer.

DOCTOR X554
And how old is he?

PATIENT X554
And he's 49.

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X554
I don't know.

DOCTOR X554
So is that why you @@@ colonoscopy @@@.

PATIENT X554
That and the procedure itself I mean, I'm bad for all of that crazy stuff I don't know.

DOCTOR X554
Yeah well obviously @@@.

PATIENT X554
Yeah.

DOCTOR X554
Yeah.

PATIENT X554
Yeah but I understand.

DOCTOR X554
It's not like you have to have this process @@@ you know.

PATIENT X554
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X554
Now you're gonna, hopefully you'll @@@ colostomy @@@ you know.

PATIENT X554
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X554
But I mean do you think you're just anxious cause you're afraid of it or stuff like that?

PATIENT X554
Yeah, I'd say just afraid of it you know.  Cause I was fine right before we got into this month.

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X554
And now, I don’t know, it’s just @@@.

DOCTOR X554
I mean it's understandable.

PATIENT X554
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X554
@@@ it's definitely understandable that you might be a little scared when you think about this but you have a brother that's not that much younger than you are.

PATIENT X554
Yeah my brother is 49.

DOCTOR X554
Did he have surgery for it?

PATIENT X554
Yeah.

DOCTOR X554
How's he doing?

PATIENT X554
He @@@ at all.

DOCTOR X554
Did he end up getting chemotherapy or anything yet?

PATIENT X554
He's already, he doing chemo and he on dialysis too.

DOCTOR X554
From the cancer or from something else?

PATIENT X554
No he was on dialysis before the cancer.

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.  Is he a diabetic?

PATIENT X554
No I think it was the drinking.

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X554
And uh he's doing chemo now.  Some days you can't @@@ for him so.  He's a little bitty guy, I mean he's a little guy.  He might weighs 105 pounds.

DOCTOR X554
So I mean, but you have your health @@@.

PATIENT X554
Yeah, yeah, @@@.

DOCTOR X554
Right now if they find something, if you have you know, if you haven't had problems with any complications @@@ chances are that if they find something they should be able to @@@ you know without having to go @@@.

PATIENT X554
Well I understand the process but I don't have those.

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X554
I don't.

DOCTOR X554
And that doesn't mean if they go in there they're going to find anything but there's always the chance of them you know, sometimes cancer starts like you know a little pimple.

PATIENT X554
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X554
And then it starts growing.  But if they find something like that they'll just take it out.

PATIENT X554
They'll just.

DOCTOR X554
And then send it out for analysis to see whatever it is.

PATIENT X554
And then there's the chance it ain't nothing.

DOCTOR X554
Yeah.  There's a chance that you'll fall asleep.

PATIENT X554
Oh.

DOCTOR X554
And if they don't see anything then you're clear for ten years to come.

PATIENT X554
There's no other symptoms, no problem.

DOCTOR X554
But sometimes, sometimes you don't need to have symptoms, while you do it, @@@.  You and me, anyone can have it starting @@@ without even knowing it.

PATIENT X554
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X554
It's better to prevent something than to be sorry later.

PATIENT X554
@@@.

DOCTOR X554
So were you ever on antidepressants @@@ in the past?

PATIENT X554
Uh no I was taking some uh, well I take some @@@ meds now.

PATIENT X554

PATIENT X554
Yep, well I hope that's the case.  @@@.  I don't know which is why I don't like the way I'm feeling with this thing.

DOCTOR X554
Yeah I'm sure it's mild.

PATIENT X554
And uh I've been away from that for a while.  Well.

DOCTOR X554
How about a tetanus shot, have you had a tetanus shot?

PATIENT X554
You know I don't think, I had one in @@@.

DOCTOR X554
You're probably due.

PATIENT X554
So let's go do it huh.  What we are gonna do with this @@@.

DOCTOR X554

DOCTOR X554
Neuralgia.

PATIENT X554
As far as I know.

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X554
It's not a form of arthritis?

DOCTOR X554
@@@ no.

PATIENT X554
Oh.

DOCTOR X554
I'll just the @@@.

PATIENT X554
Okay, cause if I'm under the cover it really sets it off.

DOCTOR X554
When you have something on top?

PATIENT X554
No when I got nothing like when I'm sleeping and @@@ under the cover.

DOCTOR X554
When you go under the covers?

PATIENT X554
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X554
Yeah.  And that is because you are stimulating the nerves on the skin.

PATIENT X554
Oh.

DOCTOR X554
Which are the nerves that are affected.  So just anything that irritates the nerves and that triggers.

PATIENT X554
Is that gonna be a lifetime thing?

DOCTOR X554
Probably.  You've had that for a while.

PATIENT X554
It's been a while yeah.  I've had three episodes of Bell palsy and that's the nerves.

DOCTOR X554
Yeah the peripheral nerves and the @@@ nerves.

PATIENT X554
Yeah.

DOCTOR X554
Are you the only one in your family with them?

PATIENT X554
Yep.  @@@.

DOCTOR X554
You won the lottery huh.

PATIENT X554
I don't want the lottery for that.  Yep.

DOCTOR X554
Any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers?

PATIENT X554
I've been having uh, what's that name?  I was in the hospital uh @@@ chest pain.

DOCTOR X554
And what did they say?

PATIENT X554
They did all of the testing everything and they said I didn't have no heart attack or nothing.

DOCTOR X554
Was it like heartburn?  Did they tell you what had @@@ that or?

PATIENT X554
Oh, that's why I @@@ important.  It might have been something different me cause I had a rash across here and across my back and uh.

DOCTOR X554
What kind of pain was it?

PATIENT X554
Oh it was a running pain, sharp running pain.

DOCTOR X554
Sharp?

PATIENT X554
Uh it was running but I didn't get no numbness in my arms.

DOCTOR X554
But if you like, did it feel like, @@@.

PATIENT X554
Yes, yes, yeah, just like that.  It was a sharp pain.

DOCTOR X554
Hmm.  Have you had it again?

PATIENT X554
No I haven't had it no more.

DOCTOR X554
Okay.

PATIENT X554
No more but it seem like after I use the albuterol it clears a lot of that.

DOCTOR X554
What do you use the albuterol for?

PATIENT X554
Cause sometimes I get uh where I just can't breathe.

DOCTOR X554
Okay.  Do you have asthma?

PATIENT X554
I don't feel like I have asthma.

DOCTOR X554
Um.

PATIENT X554
@@@.  I'm more in that way in my mind; I keep being told I'm on the borderline as a diabetic.

DOCTOR X554
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X554
Now either I am or I ain't.

DOCTOR X554
Well some people have a problem with insulin intolerance so say you produce enough insulin but sometimes the body you know @@@.

PATIENT X554
Exactly.  Exactly.

DOCTOR X554
So.

PATIENT X554
But I thought that's what might even be is @@@.

DOCTOR X554
@@@ helps for the nerve and the blood levels but the insulin, the sugar doesn't make any difference.

PATIENT X554
Okay.

DOCTOR X554
But let me see.  Okay.  Let me take a look.  Do you have numbness right now?

PATIENT X554
Uh just right here.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
How often do you get it?

PATIENT X554
I've only had it three or four times throughout the year.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
When do you get it, what are you doing when you get it?

PATIENT X554
Uh, probably pick up something or carrying groceries or something or @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Later on you mean, not while you're.

PATIENT X554
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
It's probably just musculoskeletal I would think.

PATIENT X554
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Alright um and do you have any numbness or tingling anywhere else right now?

PATIENT X554
No, no where else.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Just uh, just on your legs.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
And the other side too or just mostly here.

PATIENT X554
Both legs, it's over here and @@@ take the pressure off.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Does that help when you do that?

PATIENT X554
Yeah, yeah and @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
I don't know what to say.  I don't know what's going on.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Yeah.

PATIENT X554
And it like went away for a while.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Hmm.

PATIENT X554
And I got that electric shock.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
It still could be @@@, still could be mononeuritis multiplex.  It really could be you know usually there's an explanation for that.  Um you know it could just, it could be like you know, I don't know it; I know all these things are common.  It could just be a bad coincidence that we have all these like things like the Bell palsy and the neuralgias, I know that's three different things I know.

PATIENT X554
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Yeah.

PATIENT X554
@@@.  What was?

SECOND DOCTOR X554
You know it could be.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
It could be viral too you know I mean it could be like uh, um.  We, well maybe did you check for like, just to be really complete, did we check for all this stuff including HIV and all that, did we do that?  The HIV level.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
I don't see.

SECOND DOCTOR X554

SECOND DOCTOR X554
I'd get them both.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Get them both okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Yeah, yeah the same thing.  Yeah, I don't know, like I said.

FIRST DOCTOR X554

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
And he's on amlodipine and @@@ low dose okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Yeah I thought, I wanted to see @@@.  Alright very good @@@ okay.  Sorry I don't have any good answers for you, sometimes we don't.  And it's really frustrating, as frustrating as it is for you it is for us um.

PATIENT X554
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X554
Yeah uh, some of these nerve things you know we just don't know why they come about but we did a pretty extensive work-up.  We checked uh, to be sure we checked a lot of things and we sent you to the neurologist and they're assessing it so um @@@ I walk by there.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
So with everything, I'm going to increase the amitriptyline.

PATIENT X554
What's that?

FIRST DOCTOR X554
The one you take at bedtime or the trazodone.

PATIENT X554
Oh yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
I'm going to increase the dose so you can sleep better okay.  Do you want to pick these up at the window or do you want them mailed?

PATIENT X554
Uh I need to pick up my albuterol at the window.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Anything else?

PATIENT X554
And everything else can come in the mail.  If you see anything that's developing or new um.  I have some cream too that works well to keep your skin from being dry I was wondering if it could be prescribed over here.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Like a @@@.

PATIENT X554
Not that @@@ stuff, not that.  This is kind of like @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Does that help?

PATIENT X554
Well it kept me from being dry and scratching it you know I mean.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Okay.

PATIENT X554
It's kind of like a salve.  Can I get refills on Levitra?

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Oh.

PATIENT X554
Then I'll stay happy.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
As long as you don't end the colonoscopy appointment, I'll renew them.

PATIENT X554
Alright I'll go to the appointment.  Just be brave.  So do you, there's a chance @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Hmm.  What the leg?

PATIENT X554
You think this.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
It's the same cause as this.

PATIENT X554
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Same cause as this.

PATIENT X554
So it's getting worse.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
It doesn't, no, uh uh.

PATIENT X554
Cause I @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
No um I can’t tell you that this might happen again.

PATIENT X554
Right, right.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
But if it gets worse it doesn't mean @@@.

PATIENT X554
Oh okay, okay, alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Okay, perfect.  So I've renewed everything.  Let me make sure you can pick this one at the window and mail them and then I'll see you back in four months um.  But if you want, you can come in like a month just to get your blood pressure checked, just to make sure it's really not this high.

PATIENT X554
But don't take those two pills, just keep taking one.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
@@@.

PATIENT X554
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
Except for the amitriptyline and you're gonna see that the dose is doubled.

PATIENT X554
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X554
But instead of 25 mg you're gonna do 50 mg.

PATIENT X554
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
PATIENT.  Hi how are you?  I'm DOCTOR it's nice to meet you.  Come on back.  Hi how are you?  Are you his wife?  Oh she can come in.  Nice to meet you, I'm DOCTOR.  Come on over here okay.  Have a seat.  She can sit over there.  I ran all this stuff back so it's the only place there is.  Okay.  How are you doing?

PATIENT X716
Um I have a few issues that I need to address.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.

PATIENT X716
I had a couple of appointments that I didn't make this past year.

DOCTOR X716
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X716
That will probably need to be rescheduled.  

DOCTOR X716
No problem.

PATIENT X716
I had a sleep study and I haven't see an endocrinologist yet um.  I'm having trouble at night sleeping.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah.

PATIENT X716
Uh it's usually waking up feeling out of breath.

DOCTOR X716
How often does that happen?

PATIENT X716
Uh this has been going on for what?

SECOND PERSON X716
It happens every night um.
PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
Does he snore?

SECOND PERSON X716
He does.  And you know I thought he was holding his breath at first but no, not really.  Sometimes he does.

DOCTOR X716
Do you ever notice like he'll kind of.

SECOND PERSON X716
Yep.

DOCTOR X716
Okay you need a sleep study then, I'll order it.

SECOND PERSON X716
He'll get up, so he's probably been holding his breath, that's why he feels he can't breathe.

DOCTOR X716
How long has this been going on for?  Years, months, days?

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh only six months.

DOCTOR X716
Cause you mentioned it to DOCTOR correct?

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Um let's see.

PATIENT X716
But it wasn't this bad then.

SECOND PERSON X716
Not as bad yeah.

PATIENT X716
And I've been waking up and I came in uh about a week ago.

SECOND PERSON X716
But doctor if he's really retaining, he feels that he's retaining a lot of fluid, its worse.  When you know, when the fluid gets off of you, like you ran out of your blood pressure pills and then when they came he started taking it again, it got the fluid off again, sleeping was a little better but that's not the case now.  It's just.

DOCTOR X716
Have you ever had an ultrasound of your heart?

PATIENT X716
No.

DOCTOR X716
Okay cause the other thing that concerns me is it could be your heart.  It could be various things.  Um you're overweight so you need to lose weight so it could be obstructive sleep apnea where basically what's happening is air is getting trapped in your body and you're not able to breathe it out okay.  That's one issue.  The other thing it could be is heart failure.  Your heart, if it's not pumping appropriately, you're not getting the blood flow out and that actually can cause leakage of fluid into your lungs okay which can cause the ataxia @@@.  You're telling me fluid off, fluid on, all of that could be from your heart okay.  So we just need to get a study.  We'll do a few studies that we'll set you up for okay.  Um let me look at a couple of things okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
But you know since he's put on just a little bit more weight that's when it got worse.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
And you have family history of heart disease in your mom and dad huh?

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
What kind of heart disease?  What'd they have?  You don't know.

PATIENT X716
Um my father I know that he had heart attacks.  He had two heart attacks and @@@ and my mother has congestive heart failure.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah.

PATIENT X716
My grandfather and his father had congestive heart failure.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah I'm gonna set you up for it.

PATIENT X716
Mom has @@@ too, both in my granddaddy and grandma.

DOCTOR X716
Okay have you ever had a heart attack?

PATIENT X716
Not that I know of.

SECOND PERSON X716
But didn't you notice, well I've noticed since he's put on a little bit of weight that's when this problem started.

DOCTOR X716
The breathing.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.  The sleeping, the not being able to sleep all the way through.

DOCTOR X716
How much can you walk without shortness of breath?  Do you have trouble breathing when you walk?  No.

PATIENT X716
I get a little.

SECOND PERSON X716
If he exerts himself.

DOCTOR X716
How much though?  Like can you walk a mile?

PATIENT X716
I'm sure I can walk a mile.

DOCTOR X716
And you're able to breathe, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that?

PATIENT X716
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
Like he says yeah.

DOCTOR X716
I'm still gonna do these tests but it just leads me to think one thing or another that's all.  All these tests are going to be done because it's important just to make sure.

PATIENT X716
Well it's difficult for me to fall asleep.

DOCTOR X716
You sleep in the middle of the day?

SECOND PERSON X716
You see when you get up.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X716
He's very active in his sleep.  He's very animated.  He popping up because he needs to breathe and he's still asleep so he had an incident, was it last week, where you hit your head.

PATIENT X716
Yeah that's @@@.

SECOND PERSON X716
And he had like a well DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X716
DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X716
Said that he probably had a slight concussion.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah I saw that.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X716
I did that a couple of times before.

SECOND PERSON X716
You do that a lot because you're so sleepy when you pop up to you know breathe that you get so sleepy.

DOCTOR X716
During the day.

SECOND PERSON X716
Well when he wakes up.

DOCTOR X716
Oh okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
This is when he sleeps and then he gets up.

DOCTOR X716
@@@.

PATIENT X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X716
Then he's able to sleep better.  He's able to sleep but he @@@ during the day.

PATIENT X716
She's talking to me.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.  So we definitely need that.  We definitely need that study okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
Well why does he sleep so much better during the day?

DOCTOR X716
It's not that he sleeps so much better during the day it's that he got no restful sleep at night.

SECOND PERSON X716
Right, but he doesn't get up and he moves @@@ when he sleeps like in the middle of the day.

DOCTOR X716
Oh that's an important question, do a sleep study.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
To see his sleep pattern and we'll refer you to a sleep doctor and follow up with that okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
We have @@@ in the clinic here and he's excellent.

SECOND PERSON X716
Good.

DOCTOR X716
Um yeah we have some pretty good resources here.  We'll figure out what's going on okay.  We'll take a few tests.

PATIENT X716
Why does my nose feel like it’s always congested?

DOCTOR X716
Okay let's do one thing at a time okay.  I have @@@ I want to make sure I don't miss anything okay.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.  Okay.

DOCTOR X716
When we gave you that um pill last time you were here in April did you take it for your congestion?  Do you know?

SECOND PERSON X716
Every day.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
Did it work?

SECOND PERSON X716
@@@.

PATIENT X716
I mean during the day.

SECOND PERSON X716
It gives him some relief.

PATIENT X716
During the day I'm okay but at night it feels like somebody has stuffed tissue.

DOCTOR X716
Into your nose.

PATIENT X716
In my nose.

DOCTOR X716
How long has that been going on?  I know you were having it in April.

PATIENT X716
It's been like that for.

SECOND PERSON X716
I think since the insomnia you've had this thing.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
Okay and you use the pill and the inhaler and the nasal spray.

PATIENT X716
And I ran out of, I ran out of that.

DOCTOR X716
Was that helping?

PATIENT X716
That seemed to help a little bit but not much.  I mean.

SECOND PERSON X716
And he went to try and get stuff over-the-counter.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X716
Afrin or.

DOCTOR X716
Not working?

PATIENT X716
No Afrin didn't work.  The Vicks opened it up a little bit and then.

SECOND PERSON X716
It's very temporary.

PATIENT X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Okay and are you taking your blood pressure pill?

PATIENT X716
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Okay your blood pressure looks great.

PATIENT X716
Hmm.

DOCTOR X716
Okay um cause DOCTOR um you met, you know I actually got the letter of patients I can see who referred you to be seen in my clinic visit.  Did he ever talk to you about our MOVE Program?  The weight loss program?  @@@ kind of give you skills and diets and so it's kind of a.

SECOND PERSON X716
@@@

PATIENT X716
@@@

DOCTOR X716
Huh?

PATIENT X716
@@@.

DOCTOR X716
Is that something you would be interested in?  Like I said they have a lot of great resources here.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
Okay good.  If she's not here today I'll certainly get you in with her okay.  Um you're 45 so you don't need screening for colon cancer or anything like that yet okay.  Um your, the other thing I wanted to talk to you, I know you've got a few complaints with um, you know for your breathing I want to do two things okay.  I want to get a sleep study; I also want you to get to see our Pulmonology as well.  

SECOND PERSON X716
What do they do?

DOCTOR X716
I want you to see both of them and get the ball rolling, get the appointments as you probably know.  We'll get you in to see the endocrinologist.  You do have a history of um hyperthyroidism, so actually you had the ablation.

PATIENT X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Okay um and you're on Synthroid right now.

PATIENT X716
Yes.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.  Your last thyroid study was done in March and it was fine, okay.  Um we'll probably repeat that, well actually it was a little low, yeah and we'll get you in to see them.  And one of the other thing is um your kidney function is minimally declining okay.  Um it, my guess is the reason it's a little bit damaged is in the past your blood pressure wasn't very well controlled um and that can damage your kidneys.  Okay having good blood pressure control helps that so I do want to recheck your magnesium today.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
Um and when we do that I'm probably just gonna check your thyroid levels again cause it's been almost a year so when you see the endocrinologist we have all these lab values so they don't have to send you again to the Lab okay um.  So did you get your flu shot this year?

PATIENT X716
No.

DOCTOR X716
Um when.

PATIENT X716
They said something about a tetanus shot too.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X716
He doesn’t want the flu shot.

DOCTOR X716
You don't want the flu shot?

PATIENT X716
Or the tetanus.

SECOND PERSON X716
We don't know if you got the tetanus.

PATIENT X716
I can get both of them, how about that?

SECOND PERSON X716
That's good.

DOCTOR X716
You will, oh good.

PATIENT X716
Yeah I can get them.

DOCTOR X716
Excellent.  I'll order the tetanus right now so the nurse can have it.  Hopefully, so I've been on vacation, I'll be honest um so I have to ask them if they still have the flu shots here okay.  

SECOND PERSON X716
Well the nurse she mentioned it.

DOCTOR X716
She did okay.  I have to trust my nurse because I've never actually gotten a flu shot okay.  Regarding the nasal congestion you don't feel like the spray helps that much or do you get?

PATIENT X716
Not, I mean it opens it up a little.

SECOND PERSON X716
It seemed like the more you use it the, it's like it stops helping it the more you use it.

DOCTOR X716
Okay really okay.  I might end having to refer you to be honest with you.  Okay have a seat over here for me.  Open your mouth for me okay, sorry, lucky wife.  You've got a little congestion in your nose okay.  And it's really at night that it gets to you?

PATIENT X716
Yeah but I mean it's just there all the time.

DOCTOR X716
Okay, okay.  Deep breaths for me please.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT X716
Yep.  I started it again.

DOCTOR X716
Oh God, it's not gonna make anything with your breathing at night better.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
How much do you smoke?

PATIENT X716
Not as much though.

DOCTOR X716
How much?

PATIENT X716
Maybe seven cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR X716
That's too much.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
That is not good.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.  When did you quit?  You quit and you restarted?

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
How long has this been going on?

SECOND PERSON X716
@@@.

PATIENT X716
It'd been three years.

DOCTOR X716
What made you restart?

SECOND PERSON X716
Somebody offered him a cigarette.

PATIENT X716
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X716
Not very happy with that person.

SECOND PERSON X716
No.

DOCTOR X716
I'm sure you weren't either.

SECOND PERSON X716
No uh uh.

DOCTOR X716
Do you smoke?

SECOND PERSON X716
Never have.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
I always tell him I'm gonna start.

DOCTOR X716
You know with his mom and dad having heart attacks.

SECOND PERSON X716
But they all smoked.

DOCTOR X716
You're at, what I'm trying to tell you is you're at an incredibly high risk for heart disease okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Like its, its very high risk.  In fact could I, I don't know if we checked your cholesterol when you were in there, I'm gonna do that again today.  Yeah we didn't, oh no we did, okay.  So your cholesterol's actually good.

PATIENT X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
But that doesn't you know.

PATIENT X716
Excuse me.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.  You need to stop smoking.  We have a Smoking Cessation Clinic.

SECOND PERSON X716
And he wants to.

DOCTOR X716
Do you want me to send a referral for that?

SECOND PERSON X716
He really wants to stop smoking.

DOCTOR X716
I can give you dates and locations.

SECOND PERSON X716
He got up one day, he says I'm not gonna you know.

DOCTOR X716
I mean really.

SECOND PERSON X716
He doesn't want to.

DOCTOR X716
It's not, people think well @@@ but it's so much more than just the cigarettes.

SECOND PERSON X716
Cause I know he felt better.

DOCTOR X716
Yeah and his breathing, the nighttime breathing, that's not gonna be any better you need to quit okay.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Um.  How many pillows do you sleep on at night?

SECOND PERSON X716
Two big pillows.

DOCTOR X716
One?

SECOND PERSON X716
And uh sometimes a neck roll and that seems to really help lift his, helps him be able to lay longer.

DOCTOR X716
Why do you sleep on two pillows?

PATIENT X716
It feels like I can breathe better.

DOCTOR X716
Breathing okay.  So yeah that's another thing that makes me worry about your heart.

SECOND PERSON X716
Like the congestive heart.

DOCTOR X716
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.  Well let me, I think I'm gonna talk to.  There's a lot of things, you know I don't want you to be on the wrong side of all things and because you look like someone you know I'll have you come in to see and what we're gonna do we talked about five different things today um, not to mention just your general health and not just your complaints and because I feel like there's too much, I want to kind of see you a little more frequently now and then we can decrease it over time.  That way we can kind of make sure you're doing everything, you're following up on everything we want you to, we're nagging you about smoking, we're nagging you about exercising, all of that.  Does that sound okay?

SECOND PERSON X716
He loves to exercise.

DOCTOR X716
He does.

SECOND PERSON X716
@@@.

DOCTOR X716
What do you do?

SECOND PERSON X716
He lifts weights.  He's very.  He does put on.

DOCTOR X716
What about cardiovascular though?

SECOND PERSON X716
He used to, I don't know.

PATIENT X716
I used to do the @@@.

DOCTOR X716
And you were able to tolerate it okay, your breathing?

SECOND PERSON X716
Oh goodness yes, he has an incredible endurance.

DOCTOR X716
Good, good, that's, let's try to keep that up.

PATIENT X716
I just haven't done anything in a year.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.  Any coughs?

PATIENT X716
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Is it a smoker's cough or?

SECOND PERSON X716
And that's what I was gonna ask you, is that a smoker's cough.

PATIENT X716
Smoker's cough.

SECOND PERSON X716
But you said it do produce something, a little bit when you cough.

DOCTOR X716
Is it white?

PATIENT X716
No yellow some.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Any breathing difficulties besides at night?

PATIENT X716
Not that I know of, I mean if I exert myself.

SECOND PERSON X716
I haven't noticed.

PATIENT X716
I can get a little.

SECOND PERSON X716
Oh yeah you catch your breath, but you catch your breath very quickly.

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.

PATIENT X716
Just at night.  This nose of mine.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.

PATIENT X716
You'd think something would open it up.

DOCTOR X716
Alright let me see if um, @@@ for your nose, if not that may be a referral as well.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Okay.  Um I will be right back okay.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Sorry, I know this is a little odd, I just.

(DOCTOR OUT:  37:08  DOCTOR IN:  49:47)

DOCTOR X716
Sorry about that.  Okay, okay.  So I'm gonna put in all these referrals.  For the tests you're gonna actually just get a letter with the dates on it, that's usually how they do it.  For the clinics, I want you to go outside today and schedule them okay; the consults will be in there.  So I think it could take a little bit longer here just to schedule for the appointment, we have to put them in the computer so it's just a little bit.  Do you have the time to get your blood drawn today?

PATIENT X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
We'll be sure and draw a few things okay.  I'm gonna try something um, a decongestant for your nose okay.  I want you to try not to take it too much before you go to bed okay.  And it'll probably @@@ it can stimulate you a little bit so I don't want it to be keeping you up at night okay.  I'm gonna try just a little bit and then we'll see how you do with it okay.  Um it like I said it can kind of stimulate you.  Okay.  It's what I use specifically when I have uh congestion and I think it works very well okay.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Um and then you know I want to have you try to get in the clinic within the next month so we can make sure all your, especially your nose, those symptoms are getting better since now we're going to try other things and if everything we try doesn't work we'll refer you to the specialists okay.  Okay.  Okay so endocrine, Pulmonology.  Okay so when you go outside to the front desk I want you to make an appointment to come back to our clinic here, the endocrinologist and the lung doctor okay.  That's three appointments I want you to make and I have ordered for you to get a sleep study and a heart study okay.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
I'm deferring the MOVE till the next time we see you.  I'm not gonna have you meet them in regards to the weight loss program, I'm gonna do that next time okay.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Um I'm gonna let the nurse know we want to get your tetanus.  I think we might be over the risk of the flu.  If they have the flu shot they can give it to you, if not it's okay, okay.  Um and then I want you to get your labs drawn.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
And then also go to the Pharmacy for your meds.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
Sound good?

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X716
Sound like a plan?

PATIENT X716
Okay.  What about uh that, what am I on for the heartburn?

SECOND PERSON X716
Oh.

DOCTOR X716
Ranitidine?

PATIENT X716
No what is it omeprazole?

DOCTOR X716
Omeprazole.

SECOND PERSON X716
Yes.

PATIENT X716
Omeprazole.

DOCTOR X716
Yep.  Do you need that?

PATIENT X716
Um I just had that refilled but it's like something I need.  Sometimes I have to take two.

SECOND PERSON X716
Yeah.

DOCTOR X716
Um so, let me see what dose you're on.  That's actually okay or you can take it twice a day.  The key is, are you taking it 30 minutes before you eat?  That's actually very important for it to even work.

SECOND PERSON X716
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X716
It doesn't work, if you don't take it 30 minutes before you eat and the thing with this medication is you need to take it every day, not just when you need it okay.

PATIENT X716
Oh I take it every day.

SECOND PERSON X716
Is it 30, is it each meal?

DOCTOR X716
No that's before breakfast.

SECOND PERSON X716
Or just before breakfast.

DOCTOR X716
Before breakfast okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
Maybe that's what @@@.

DOCTOR X716
If you need to take it before one more time you can take it before dinner but it's got to be 30 minutes before.

SECOND PERSON X716
Well see that's the thing he runs out of it.

DOCTOR X716
And then it doesn't get active, @@@.

SECOND PERSON X716
Yes okay, yes.

DOCTOR X716
It doesn't get activated @@@, eating activates it okay.

PATIENT X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
So that's the only reason to be taking it otherwise nothing okay.

SECOND PERSON X716
Now is it the prescription for one or is it for more than one a day?  Just so.

DOCTOR X716
I'm gonna give you for one a day for now.

SECOND PERSON X716
Okay.

DOCTOR X716
If you run out you can give us a call but you'll probably be seen by us in time.

PATIENT X716

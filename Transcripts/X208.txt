Okay.  I'll make sure that the rest go to DOCTOR then uh-huh okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
You just, I guess you just have to flip a little lever or something right?  I don't know.

DOCTOR X208
Maybe she was on vacation yeah.  Yeah or if you work the night shift then you don't have clinics during that time.

SECOND PERSON X208
Oh okay yeah.

SECOND PERSON X208

DOCTOR X208
Uh let's see.  This is 5 mg.

SECOND PERSON X208
Cause he takes another one at noon time @@@.  But when he gets the bloody nose his blood pressure went way up, it may have well been because of the @@@, this other drug.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
Anyway.  @@@.

Okay.

DOCTOR X208
Okay, alright.  Your blood pressure's pretty good today.  Have you felt dizzy at all since this one was increased?

SECOND PERSON X208

DOCTOR X208
No palpitations?  Do you ever feel a flutter in your chest?

PATIENT X208

SECOND PERSON X208
He has issues with irregular heartbeat but you don't feel it right?

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.

PATIENT X208
Pardon?

SECOND PERSON X208
Irregular heartbeat, you don't feel that do you?

PATIENT X208
No what I do have is.

SECOND PERSON X208
The atrial fibrillation.

DOCTOR X208
The atrial fibrillation yeah.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah.

DOCTOR X208
We know about it.  We know about your arrhythmia, but do you notice it?  Do you notice it?  Do you notice anything?

PATIENT X208
I'm not sure where we're at.

SECOND PERSON X208
Well when you have the irregular heartbeat, do you notice it at all?  Is it any different for you?

PATIENT X208
You're calling it by some other name than I've heard before.

SECOND PERSON X208
xxx fibrillation.

PATIENT X208
Huh?

SECOND PERSON X208
xxx fibrillation.

PATIENT X208
Right atrial fibrillation okay, now I understand.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.

PATIENT X208
But I've never felt anything with that.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

PATIENT X208
With that in mind.

DOCTOR X208
Okay that's good, okay.  Alright any coughing or coughing up sputum?

PATIENT X208
No.

DOCTOR X208
No coughing?

PATIENT X208
No.

DOCTOR X208
No, okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
He'd only had that @@@ when he went into the hospital.  @@@ when the um was in there you they noticed that he went into atrial fibrillation so the doctor said @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X208
Which he had where they @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@ and a couple days later he was in terrible, terrible pain in his groin.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
And he had a leak.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
I'm sure it was coming from that.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah what did they do for him?

SECOND PERSON X208
Well they put him, they took him down and they found that he was bleeding.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
And so they gave him four units of blood.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.  He had four units of blood.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X208
And um, and that's about all and then they released him to therapy another week later and released him to xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.  So when did he come back from xxx?

SECOND PERSON X208
Uh the, I think it was the 11th of December.

PATIENT X208
I went home, I was released.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah.

DOCTOR X208
So he bled, he needed four units of blood before he went to xxx.

SECOND PERSON X208
Right.

DOCTOR X208
Then he came home and you guys saw DOCTOR and she checked his blood count.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yes.

DOCTOR X208
So his blood count was low compared to where it had been in the past?

SECOND PERSON X208
Wasn't it 9 something?

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah that's what it is here I got.  I also have a report just from um.

DOCTOR X208
So maybe, so you had some that were in the 9s and then one of them was up to close to 13 and then back down to 9.7 again and so.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
Well.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
This one doesn't really need, I mean all of the other were in the same range @@@ than that one but as you can see that maybe a year and a half ago he went up to 11 and 12.  

SECOND PERSON X208
He was at 11 when he went into the hospital.

DOCTPR X208
Okay. 

SECOND PERSON X208
The records shows 11 something when he went into the hospital.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah well we can recheck his blood count today to make sure that it's stable.  Have you had any blood in your stool?

PATIENT X208
They just gave me stool tests.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah you haven't had those, brought those in yet.

PATIENT X208
Yeah I haven't turned them in yet.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@ he had to finish the dialysis.

PATIENT X208
But they're all completed ready to turn in.

DOCTOR X208
Okay from the Dialysis Lab okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
They're going to look at him too.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X208
So we could have them sent to you.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah, could you do that?

SECOND PERSON X208
Yes.

DOCTOR X208
To DOCTOR?

SECOND PERSON X208
Yes.

DOCTOR X208
Okay and then the other thing is, you know, how long have you been on dialysis?

PATIENT X208
Oh long time.

SECOND PERSON X208
Seven years @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Seven years.

SECOND PERSON X208
Seven some years.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.  So you know anywhere between 10 and 12, really is an okay hemoglobin.  Patients who are on dialysis are anemic because they are, you know you have to take a replacement with dialysis and your kidneys help you keep your blood @@@.

SECOND PERSON X208
But he feels so weak.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X208
He still has trouble standing up cause he's weak and I wondered if they brought him his meals because while he's been home.  He's been home since.

PATIENT X208
The 11th.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@ the 11th of December and still has a real hard time standing up because of the severe weakness and I just wondered if @@@.

PATIENT X208
I'm not making any progress.

SECOND PERSON X208
He just doesn't seem to be getting better.  He's still real weak.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.  Is he still getting any rehab?

SECOND PERSON X208
Yes, he gets Home Health.

DOCTOR X208
Home rehab.  

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah home rehab.

DOCTOR X208
How many times a week?

SECOND PERSON X208
Twice.

DOCTOR X208
Twice a week okay and then what is his activity level in between the rehab program?

SECOND PERSON X208
Uh he does the exercises; he has weights and will lift the weights.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
And he also uh, he walks.  He walks @@@ the hallways he walks.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
And we went once to the right there he went to the @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.  But he just doesn't seem to be getting his strength back and it's really tough.

DOCTOR X208
You know it takes some time and then some of that would be the anemia.  I don't know where his counts are now but being anemic makes you feel weak or makes you weak.  You know when you're anemic and having all the previous medical problems that he's had and then you know being so deconditioned where he needs the rehab all of that kind of combines.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah.

DOCTOR X208
And it just takes a long time to get better.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
Plus um, when was the last time that he saw DOCTOR the hematologist?

PATIENT X208
Uh.

SECOND PERSON X208
Not too long before that, probably September or October.  It was shortly before.

PATIENT X208
I haven't seen him since I left the.

SECOND PERSON X208
Not since he's been sick.

PATIENT X208
I went to him.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay this is right after he got out of the hospital and that's from DOCTOR @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
For the dialysis.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

PATIENT X208
That's before I went to them.

SECOND PERSON X208
That's before you went to hospital.

PATIENT X208
Before I @@@ into uh.

SECOND PERSON X208
No that was after you came home, like the 12th or 13th, you came home on the 11th and you had dialysis the next day I think.  @@@ but they do it once a month.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X208
Well I thought I left since I went into.

SECOND PERSON X208
xxx xxx.

PATIENT X208
No, well shortly before I went into xxx but before going to see DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X208
And that's before you went to the hospital.

PATIENT X208
Yeah I saw that.

SECOND PERSON X208
Which one?

PATIENT X208
xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X208
Hmm okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
That's another thing, because he had such bad bloody noses and then he had the breathing problem.  He has a breathing problem.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
Is there any indication that?

DOCTOR X208
No not, he hasn't had any bleeding recently correct?

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
Right.  But outside of that, after he saw the ENT, the nose surgeon.

SECOND PERSON X208
No that's right.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.  So you know once he follows with them, as long as you know he's not still bleeding @@@ and then um his anemia is most likely from his kidney @@@.  (phone rings, doctor answers)  Okay.  I'm just going to do a quick exam here.  

SECOND PERSON X208
Is there anything they can do to build up his blood?

DOCTOR X208
Um.

SECOND PERSON X208
Cause his INR is lower than 2.

DOCTOR X208
So the kidney doctors sometimes recommend for IV iron infusion but um and DOCTOR is a blood doctor too.

SECOND PERSON X208
Oh too.

DOCTOR X208
So I think.

SECOND PERSON X208
So I should try to get another appointment with him?

DOCTOR X208
I think so.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.  Or even with the kidney docs to ask them if they think the IV, getting iron through them.  Because right now, is he on an iron supplement?

SECOND PERSON X208
No.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah so um you know we need to know that the bleeding isn't coming from the rectum and that he's not bleeding internally because @@@ when you treat someone with iron @@@ and the blood @@@.

SECOND PERSON X208
Right.

DOCTOR X208
But you know that's something we can always @@@ to make sure that they're stable.  But if it's stable, if everything is stable and it looks like you know he's anemic because he is chronically ill and on hemodialysis then you know IV iron could be you know an option other than the iron tablets.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@ so he never has gone back up since before he went to the hospital.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X208
And he was given blood; normally it always goes back up.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah, right.  That's why, so if you look at the trends of his hemoglobin @@@.

SECOND PERSON X208
Going back and forth.

DOCTOR X208
It's kind of back and forth.  Over the last you know year and a half is all but even maybe a year ago he was still in the 9s.

SECOND PERSON X208
Oh.

DOCTOR X208
So even though he's 9.7, that's not different from where he was almost a year ago in March of last year he was 9.6.  The big question is here from you know June of 09 to September of 09, @@@ fell down to the 9s in March 2010.  But since March of 2010 @@@ he's been in the same range as the count in September.  This out liner here.

SECOND PERSON X208
It just used to be that he can't get his legs back @@@.

DOCTOR X208
@@@ yeah.  @@@ can really be hard.  But being a kidney patient, being a dialysis patient, you don't really shoot for high goals like that for his kidneys because you have the understanding that he's a kidney patient.

SECOND PATIENT X208
And that controls everything.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.  So you know that's a good question that you have but you know some oral iron supplements or IV iron infusion you know twice a week or something like that could help with his anemia.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
Uh-huh.  Yep, okay.  Can you lean forward?

PATIENT X208
Yeah.

DOCTOR X208
Okay great.  Deep breath.  Okay deep breath.  Okay.  Okay.  Alright.  A little bit of swelling here.  Let's see this one.  

SECOND PERSON X208
The other one really @@@.

DOCTOR X208
When was his dialysis?  The last dialysis?

SECOND PERSON X208
Monday.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.  Alright, let me talk with the doctor.  How much fluid did they pull off?  Do you know?  How much fluid?

PATIENT X208
No I don't know.

DOCTOR X208
Okay, that's okay.  Alright.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.  

SECOND PERSON X208
So and this is also, yeah this is new too, yeah that is new and this scrape is new.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
That happened @@@.

DOCTOR X208
So that's been on there.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yes.

PATIENT X208
I weigh in and I weigh out.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay now there's one thing that I've never questioned at xxx is the blood tests, I'll need those back.

DOCTOR X208
Yep I'm going to bring those right back to you.

SECOND PERSON X208
Um @@@ his cholesterol @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah for his total cholesterol.  We need to look at everything.  I'm @@@; I'm not going to make too many changes without DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X208
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X208
So I'm not going to change that medication.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah.

PATIENT X208
I never really talked to DOCTOR.  I don’t believe.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah you had one visit with him.  @@@.

PATIENT X208
I didn't get a telephone call from him.

SECOND PERSON X208
No we met with him.  We met once with him.  I don't think, why take so many statin drugs if you don't need them you know.

DOCTOR X208
Um but with his history you know just for protection to have those on board.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X208
Maybe @@@ going on.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X208
Could be enough.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah I'll um, just keep taking them as you are and then I'll send DOCTOR a note @@@.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah.

DOCTOR X208
I'll be back shortly.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  58:11  DOCTOR IN:  68:59)

DOCTOR X208
Okay.  Alright.  So we're all done here for the day.  I'm going to have.

SECOND PERSON X208
He needs some more refills on these four.

DOCTOR X208
Okay do you want 90 days or 30?  Let's just do the 90 and that'll last you for a while.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
So this is @@@, here's the new list.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
This is the amlodipine 10 mg.  This came up at 5, because I hadn't signed the order.  When they sign the order then it'll be changed.  All of this I'll give you 90 days on everything.  So like these refills, @@@ 90 days for everything and they'll be mailed to your house.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.  Now there's one, I don't know @@@.  But there's one @@@ except for this one @@@.  Will he be okay without that for a few days?

DOCTOR X208
Do you want to pick it up today?

SECOND PERSON X208
He really should have it right?

DOCTOR X208
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X208
Cause that's the one that @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah, the kidneys okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
Well then let's get it.

DOCTOR X208
Get it from the Pharmacy today okay.

PATIENT X208
Do they close at a certain time?

DOCTOR X208
Yeah that's why um we need you guys heading down there.  So I'll renew everything but that one I'll say that you can pick it up today.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.  Do you need help putting this away?

SECOND PERSON X208
No I'll put it in my bag here so I would.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
So I could carry it.

PATIENT X208
You need to keep those four separated now.

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah I'll put those away.  But it's okay because she's ordering it.

PATIENT X208
She's ordering all four of those?

SECOND PERSON X208
Yeah.  Some of them we don't really need.  Just some of them @@@.

DOCTOR X208
Okay so this one you can pick up right now from the Pharmacy.  

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay when do we come back @@@.

DOCTOR X208
No that's fine.

SECOND PERSON X208

DOCTOR X208
I'll have you go down and pick them up at the window.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay I would like to get that.

DOCTOR X208
Actually you have three refills on the @@@.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
Yeah and it was last filled on December 14th.

SECOND PERSON X208
@@@.

DOCTOR X208
So it should be coming to you in the mail.

SECOND PERSON X208
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X208
Okay.  Alright.  Okay.  So this is for you and when you go up front to check out, they should schedule you with the eye doctor because you missed that appointment and then with DOCTOR in HEMOC, Hematology/Oncology.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay.

DOCTOR X208
And then DOCTOR needs to see him.

SECOND PERSON X208
Okay I wonder @@@.  

DOCTOR X208
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X208
So would we just bring him in?

DOCTOR X208
So that would be @@@.

SECOND PERSON X208
Bring @@@.

DOCTOR X208
No you can actually um go to the Hearing Clinic, the Hearing Clinic so I'll put in a consult for that.

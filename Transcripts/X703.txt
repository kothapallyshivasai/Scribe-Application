DOCTOR X703
Oh.

PATIENT X703
I got 100 different bottles of medicine.

DOCTOR X703
Hmm.

PATIENT X703
And I got a decent idea but I was hoping.

DOCTOR X703
Okay let's go through these all right now because yeah.

PATIENT X703
If you could show me, four or five.

DOCTOR X703
You shouldn't be on that many medicines actually.  

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
One, two, three, four, five.

PATIENT X703
I should be getting four.

DOCTOR X703
Six, seven, eight, nine medicines including aspirin is what you should take every day I think.

PATIENT X703
I thought it was just five.  

DOCTOR X703
Alright.

PATIENT X703
That's why I'm great cause see.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.

PATIENT X703
I brought me a separate bag.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
Of all kinds of pills.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.

PATIENT X703
For my blood pressure.

DOCTOR X703
I bet you some of these are probably repeated so hopefully, are you looking at the bottle every day, you're not taking.

PATIENT X703
Yep.

DOCTOR X703
You're taking one of everything in there or how are you taking it?

PATIENT X703
Uh we got what's up here; I've got one of those weekly medicine bottles.

DOCTOR X703
Oh okay.

PATIENT X703
And I sit at the table and I make me a week's worth of medicines.

DOCTOR X703
But you know which ones to do.

PATIENT X703
That's what I'm gonna find out now hopefully.

DOCTOR X703
But I mean how have you been doing it?  Like out of all these bottles, you know at the beginning of the week how do you figure out which of these you need?

PATIENT X703
I look on there.

DOCTOR X703
Oh you have a sheet oh.

PATIENT X703
That's my sheet there; no you can look at it.

DOCTOR X703
No, no, oh this is your sheet that you gave me.

PATIENT X703
I looked on there.

DOCTOR X703
Oh yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X703
In fact I want you to check.

DOCTOR X703
I was giving you a bad time.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X703
I look over there, find out and checking, and drop one of them in.

DOCTOR X703
Oh okay yeah.

PATIENT X703
But I'm saying, if I don't need the rest of that stuff.

DOCTOR X703
No I get it.

PATIENT X703
The, you won't have it.

DOCTOR X703
Oh yeah, I mean it's not in your computer anymore.  Some of these probably are old ones, you should just remove them.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
If they don't match that list.

PATIENT X703
That's what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.

PATIENT X703
Anything that I don't need I want to put it in that little grey box over there.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.  And you did all these changes here that we talked about?  You know like I got things right here.

PATIENT X703
I started taking a half now and this @@@ pill.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah you did all those changes right, okay.  And you stopped taking the potassium all together?

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
Okay and then the metformin, your diabetes one you cut in half.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
And then the other one.

PATIENT X703
Well you done sent me the 500s already.

DOCTOR X703
Right, right.

PATIENT X703
So I ain't got to cut them in half.

DOCTOR X703
But before you got them I had you cut them in half.

PATIENT X703
I was cutting them in half right.

DOCTOR X703
Okay and then the water pill once you got this combination one you stopped this one as far as you know or?

PATIENT X703
Okay what's the water pill?

DOCTOR X703
That's hydrochlorothiazide.  So this was your old one.  But I said when the new medicine comes stop this one and we'll change it to this one, so that should be one of the things that when you got this one when you read the bottle, should throw out this old one.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
So I don't know, I mean here's the new list so it will be easier  but uh, you know you can  keep this okay, let's just look at that and we'll check mark if it’s here.  So that's there.

PATIENT X703
Okay this is high blood pressure?

DOCTOR X703
Uh cholesterol.

PATIENT X703
Okay I take that too cause I take.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah I'll put them all here and then we'll know exactly what you're taking.

PATIENT X703
A half a tablet of that a day.

DOCTOR X703
Exactly.  This is, yep this is that new one I sent you, take one half tablet by mouth every day yep.  I've got it okay.  Metoprolol this you take one half twice a day for cholesterol, see maybe these are as many as you're supposed to take.  There's those and I think these are all your regular ones actually.  Terazosin, I mean these creams I'm not really counting, I don't really know if you take those anymore so.  The creams, what's this?  Oh this.

PATIENT X703
Okay I got one tablet left in one of those bottles.

DOCTOR X703
So this is a repeat.  This one is just a repeat.

PATIENT X703
Okay.  So everything in that thing I supposed to be taking.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah, use before November 13, 2012, August okay, so you want to take one pill by mouth every day 40 mg, you want to combine these two?

PATIENT X703
Well see my wife tell me I shouldn’t mix the lot together I should empty one before I start on the other one.

DOCTOR X703
You can yeah well you can do that.  They both have good expiration dates, you know neither one of them expired.

PATIENT X703
Okay.  Well doc.

DOCTOR X703
So not me, I don't want to confuse yourself here so.

PATIENT X703
We can pour them together.  Yeah I can get rid of one of them bottles.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah I mean as long as you read it carefully, if they're both not expired and they both say 40 mg and they're the same doses.  They may look different but then maybe if it's different manufacturers or what it may be.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
So, these actually they look the exact same.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
I know they're 40 mg tablets so you can combine these two if you want.

PATIENT X703
Okay, very good.  Thank you sir.

DOCTOR X703
Otherwise yeah these are all your medicines.  So you've actually been doing it right.  Hang on.  These are all your medicines.  Put all these in whatever bag you want to put them in.

PATIENT X703

DOCTOR X703
This is trash.

PATIENT X703

DOCTOR X703

PATIENT X703

PATIENT X703
And you checked on everything that I need to take.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.

PATIENT X703
Thank you, you checked it.

DOCTOR X703
This one, I don't think you're taking anymore, it's magnesium but I'm not still sure you need it anymore.

PATIENT X703
No I don't take the magnesium.

DOCTOR X703
Everything with a check mark.  The only two that aren't are some creams that I don't really know if you need it anymore or not.

PATIENT X703
Right, I don't do that.

DOCTOR X703
Okay so there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight cause the magnesium we're getting rid of.

PATIENT X703
I need to take eight in a day.

DOCTOR X703
Eight medicines.

PATIENT X703

PATIENT X703
With the metformin it's keeping it, you know, I would say every now and then I might cheat and get me a piece of cake or something it might run up to 120 or something but.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
Then boom, you know the next day its back where it's supposed to be.

DOCTOR X703
Okay cause we actually, you know we cut down; we didn't want to be that aggressive even because your sugars were almost too well controlled.  So what they're normally like 120s or something or?

PATIENT X703
Right, they're normally in the 120s.

DOCTOR X703
Okay and you never have any low ones I think you were telling me before.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X703
Here lately.

DOCTOR X703
Alright um.  

PATIENT X703
It's been bad.  I signed up, I did some @@@ probably a year ago but it just doubled since I did that.

DOCTOR X703
Okay, do you want to, you know I know they have different options here.  They have either kind of behavioral therapy, kind of like one to one or something.  I think there may be even someone down here that we can try to set you up with and she can tell you who the best person to go is.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
Or like a group session.  There's also group PTSD.

PATIENT X703
I would rather start out with the one on one.

DOCTOR X703
Okay alright.

PATIENT X703
And with him or her directly.

DOCTOR X703
Okay, alright.  We can see.

PATIENT X703
Maybe direct.

DOCTOR X703
We can see if she's down there even, I think its NAME I think is kind of who deals with that and she can direct you to the right people and everything.

PATIENT X703
Right.  

DOCTOR X703
So we'll do that.

PATIENT X703
Very good.

DOCTOR X703
Remind me before we leave uh let's see here blood pressure today looked good.  No lightheadedness or dizziness or anything like that?

PATIENT X703
Hmm no.

DOCTOR X703
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X703
But here's what I'm saying, I been losing my balance and all kind of stuff lately.

DOCTOR X703
Oh you have.

PATIENT X703
Yes.

DOCTOR X703
Hmm.

PATIENT X703
And then I've got a semi-dizziness going on you know.

DOCTOR X703
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X703
It's not so dizzy that I feel like I need somebody to hold me up or something but like I'm sitting down right now.

DOCTOR X703
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X703
And my head is spinning a little you know it's not, I don't feel stable anymore.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.  You don't okay um.  How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X703
Oh shit, two, three months.

DOCTOR X703
Two, three months okay.

PATIENT X703
But like I say it to me seem like it’s getting worse.

DOCTOR X703
Hmm.  Okay.  Let's see, maybe I mean I'm wondering if your blood pressures are a little too low too cause you had one here that was 96/54.

PATIENT X703
Right that's kind of low.

DOCTOR X703
Uh that's kind of low.  Especially if you're saying you feel a little lightheaded and dizzy at times um okay.  So maybe we can cut down on some of, you're on four different blood pressure medicines, maybe we could get rid of one you know and just kind of see how your blood pressure does.  Let me see how it's yeah the problem is it was high back in September but otherwise it's looking pretty good okay.  And you've been eating well and everything like that?

PATIENT X703
Yeah.

DOCTOR X703
No vomiting or anything like that?

PATIENT X703
No.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.  You haven't fell or anything?

PATIENT X703
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR X703
You haven't fell or anything recently?

PATIENT X703
No.

DOCTOR X703
And this lightheadedness you said you've been having, is that mainly like if you go from sitting to standing or something all of a sudden?

PATIENT X703
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X703
Once you're up and about are you okay or?

PATIENT X703
Right well I you know I'm in bad shape now I don't really stand long, I make sure.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
That I don't have to stand long.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.  Um alright, let's see.  Alright um.

PATIENT X703
And doc if so.

DOCTOR X703
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X703
If you can, I would like an appointment to go see that one on one.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.

PATIENT X703
It's because I had @@@ come out with me today cause I wasn't feeling that well.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
And I don't want to keep him.

DOCTOR X703
Oh.

PATIENT X703

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
You know.

DOCTOR X703
Have you gone to that MOVE thing?  I saw that you had the.

PATIENT X703
No.

DOCTOR X703
Okay but you saw the other guy.

PATIENT X703
And is there anything @@@ feel like I'm just energy depleted.  

DOCTOR X703
Hmm I mean yeah see I'm not sure if it's just a combination of maybe your low blood pressure but it generally it's pretty good.  Today it's the first time it's kind of low um let's see.  I mean we could try to maybe go down on your blood pressure med a little bit, maybe that's causing you to be too low.

PATIENT X703
And maybe just see.

DOCTOR X703
You said your wife, I know, checks it at home.  Do you remember what those numbers are?

PATIENT X703
She just checked it last night too you know.  

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
Cause really when she check it I really don't pay no attention unless she say ooh NAME this is too low or it's too high you know.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
And she tell me it’s okay.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.  And you have that sleep appointment coming up right?

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
Uh in March, yeah it's in March for your appointment okay and you are still using that mask and everything?  That's the other thing that's gonna be important sometimes you know.

PATIENT X703
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X703
Okay, see that can be a big reason if you're tired and stuff if you're not using that properly.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
That's one of those things if you're not using it, you're not breathing well in the middle of the night then you get real tired during the day.  Even if you sleep eight hours it's not gonna be eight good hours of sleep.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
Um so if you're using it you know how much are you using it per night, the whole night?

PATIENT X703
No.

DOCTOR X703
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X703
I may, my DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X703
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X703
She's telling me do it at least two hours.  I might do three or four hours, that's the most.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.  Alright um.

PATIENT X703
But see I'm getting up all night peeing and I can't break, I say I can't I haven't broke the habit of not drinking no liquids after 8 o'clock yet.

DOCTOR X703
Okay you're still drinking them.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
And everybody knows, @@@ that you put that water in there you know it got to come out.

DOCTOR X703
Right, exactly and now and you know you're on the water pill and everything um so let's see.  Okay and let's see, you're not a smoker or anything?

PATIENT X703
No.  I got enough problem with it I don't need those.  I don't need to add to it.

DOCTOR X703
Okay and I want to see if your labs came back today.  Uh your potassium looks a lot better that's good.

PATIENT X703
That's from today and they done got it back already?

DOCTOR X703
Uh-huh.  Yep.  Your @@@ is kind of high okay.

PATIENT X703
My wife told me that a diet I just started Wednesday on the new system.

DOCTOR X703
What system?

PATIENT X703
The half a tablet a day that you know.

DOCTOR X703
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X703
I guess it does Monday, to Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday but that is the sixth time I did it.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.  Alright.  Let me go talk with DOCTOR and let him know how you're doing uh maybe try to cut down on some of your blood pressure meds and see if that helps and I'll find out who you can talk to over there and just give you the information since you don't want to go today right?

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
Okay, alright uh that sound fair?

PATIENT X703
Is she gonna have to make me an appointment or how we gonna work that?

DOCTOR X703
I'll ask her yeah.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
They'll make you an appointment.

PATIENT X703
That'll be good.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
Yes sir, I'm okay with that.

DOCTOR X703
Okay now you're okay on all your medicines you think right?

PATIENT X703
Yes sir yeah.

DOCTOR X703
Give me a second here.

(DOCTOR OUT:  38:26  DOCTOR IN:  45:31)

DOCTOR X703
Alright, did you get the flu shot?

PATIENT X703
Yeah.

DOCTOR X703
Oh you did okay.  Alright so one other thing, do you said you're eating and drinking well, how many glasses of water do you think you have a day?  A lot or just kind of?

PATIENT X703
A lot.

DOCTOR X703
A lot okay um cause it looks like you know your kidney level went up a little bit um but showed another level it could maybe because of the water pill that we gave you may be a little bit dry so you know try taking in a little bit more fluid you know, maybe that's what's causing the low blood pressure.

PATIENT X703
Right.  Okay.

DOCTOR X703
You know so just.

PATIENT X703
To tell you the truth about it.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.

PATIENT X703
It's not so much I been drinking a lot of water.

DOCTOR X703
Oh okay.

PATIENT X703
I been drinking a lot of apple cider.

DOCTOR X703
Okay.

PATIENT X703
And when I drink the apple cider I don't drink as much water.

DOCTOR X703
Oh okay.  So you know cause your kidney function went up a little bit, nothing abnormal outside of where you've been before.  It's been that way before uh your blood pressure is down a little bit so maybe you're just a little bit dehydrated or something and that's why your kidneys are going up, that's why the blood pressure is a little bit low and on top you're taking a water pill so maybe we can try you know staying better hydrated.

PATIENT X703
And I'll just stay off the apple cider and drink more water.

DOCTOR X703
Do you drink a lot of caffeine and stuff that'd be the other thing to just cut that out.  That dehydrates you.

PATIENT X703
I don't drink no coffee.

DOCTOR X703
You're not a coffee drinker.

PATIENT X703
Well you now once in a while, I ain't gonna say I don't drink no coffee.

DOCTOR X703
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X703
A couple cups a month or something.

DOCTOR X703
Okay alright but not a lot of Coke or anything like that either?

PATIENT X703
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X703
Okay, alright um so maybe that's what we'll try to do is just kind of try staying a little bit hydrated.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
And see if that kind of improves things.

PATIENT X703
Very good.

DOCTOR X703
Um the other thing is well actually you know because your kidneys did go up a little bit.

PATIENT X703
Yeah.

DOCTOR X703
Metformin is one of those things that is broken down by the kidneys.

PATIENT X703
Yeah.

DOCTOR X703
The question is how much do you need the metformin still or not um so what we'd like to do actually is maybe stop your metformin completely.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
Give you a trial off of it because your numbers have looked so good before and have you come back in three months, kind of similar to what you did now with labs.

PATIENT X703
Very good, very good.

DOCTOR X703
Get the labs drawn; we'll see what the hemoglobin A1c is.

PATIENT X703
No problem.

DOCTOR X703
And if it looks good then you might not need anything for your diabetes.  If it looks a little bit worse but not terrible we can put you on a different pill that's just usually like once a day and it doesn't affect the kidneys as much.

PATIENT X703
Very good.

DOCTOR X703
So this may be a good time to give you a trial to see if you need the medicine at all.  If you don't.

PATIENT X703
Very good.

DOCTOR X703
You know then no reason to.

PATIENT X703
I'm glad to do that.

DOCTOR X703
Um obviously one other thing is to continue checking your sugars and if they start getting real sky high or higher than they normally run call us back and then maybe we'll start you on this pill then sooner than that.

PATIENT X703
But what you're saying is when I leave here today.

DOCTOR X703
Yeah.

PATIENT X703
I don't worry about the half a pill that I supposed to be taking.

DOCTOR X703
Right, yeah don't take it but still check your sugars.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
Okay and if your sugar is now 120 and if it starts getting into 190, 200.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
That's really high.

PATIENT X703
Yeah then go back on my metformin.

DOCTOR X703
No, no, then call us and we'll probably send you a different pill.

PATIENT X703
You got that, do I have your number?

DOCTOR X703
Yeah I mean you just have to call the xxx xxx here, uh do you want to write it down on that paper yeah, NUMBER okay.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
And that way, I think we could try to get you off the metformin period uh it's just a weaker medicine if you need it.  

PATIENT X703
Very good.

DOCTOR X703
But if your sugars start getting high call us back and maybe we'll mail you a different medicine, not the metformin.

PATIENT X703
Okay doc, go for that.

DOCTOR X703
Uh so I'll stop that on your list and then let me see uh and then you're gonna get the labs drawn before your next appointment.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
Like you did this time.

PATIENT X703
Just like I did this morning.

DOCTOR X703
So they'll send you a letter, you know with the exact date and time just come in you know an hour or two before that and get your lab done.

PATIENT X703
Right.

DOCTOR X703
So it'll be in the computer.

PATIENT X703
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X703
Let me see if that lady is down there um before you walk all the way down there let me see if she's there.  Alright, we'll see if we can just get the number from up there she wasn't at her door.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
So maybe give you her number and then maybe you can give her a call.

PATIENT X703
Okay.

DOCTOR X703
And set something up.

PATIENT X703

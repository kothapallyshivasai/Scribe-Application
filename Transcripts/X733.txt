The A1c?

PATIENT X733
A1c, it was kind of higher at some point I guess I got it down to 7 something.

DOCTOR X733

PATIENT X733
Right.

DOCTOR X733

DOCTOR X733
119.

PATIENT X733
Yeah, yeah.  Till I take my blood pressure I probably got some of these.

DOCTOR X733
That's good but we need to keep it that way.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
Because you already have diabetes.

PATIENT X733
Right, right.

DOCTOR X733
That's already gonna give you, if you didn't have one, you're gonna get just a little bit.

PATIENT X733
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.

PATIENT X733
Every day.

DOCTOR X733
Uh is that pretty easy or a lot of labor?

PATIENT X733
Uh yeah maybe cause I used to be a driver but I got a DUI so I'm not driving anymore so uh yeah, I do a lot of walking and stuff mostly.

DOCTOR X733
What happened with the DUI?

PATIENT X733
Oh well that was about four, about five, six years back.  I @@@ just ain't driving.  Had to go through, had to try to get my license back anyway so.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.

PATIENT X733
I guess they'll set it up.

DOCTOR X733
Are you still drinking?

PATIENT X733
Uh every now and then I do have a drink.  Mostly wine or something like that.  Sometimes it's a beer.

DOCTOR X733
Friday.

PATIENT X733
Yeah that's when I had one.

DOCTOR X733
And okay.  And that's fine I mean, I just um you know we're always concerned when people like use a lot of alcohol too much.

PATIENT X733
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X733
And that's something we even see sometimes with people who have odd hours you know because if it's hard to get to sleep or you've just a lot of down time by yourself.

PATIENT X733
Right.

DOCTOR X733
So you find yourself relying on alcohol to deal with it.

PATIENT X733
Oh no it's not as bad.

DOCTOR X733
So do you ever feel like you need to cut down?

PATIENT X733
Oh no way, I don't drink every day.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.

PATIENT X733
I don't take it like every day or something.

DOCTOR X733
Just want to make sure.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
I know too you have a little bit of anxiety and I know.

PATIENT X733
Right.

DOCTOR X733
If you feel sometimes you.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
If that's it I'm glad.

PATIENT X733
Okay.

DOCTOR X733
Um so is anything else going on?  Looks like you're doing well.  We kind of just check all these labs today and uh figure out where we're at with that.

PATIENT X733
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X733
Um do you need any refills?

PATIENT X733
Yeah but some of the refills you probably @@@ giving like from the anxiety pills, you might not be giving that anxiety pill.

DOCTOR X733
@@@.

PATIENT X733
I guess but I tried to get them.

DOCTOR X733
Well I'd like to go see them if you're here today and you're off.

PATIENT X733
Hmm.  Actually I got off but yeah I could call them.

DOCTOR X733
Oh you just want to call them.  

PATIENT X733
Yeah I can call them.

DOCTOR X733
I mean sometimes it's good to see them and just talk to them about the anxiety.  Um.  To me it is more important than just calling.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
If you need it I'm happy to refill it for you.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
The thing is I don't even see it on here.  What were you taking for anxiety?

PATIENT X733
It was that blue something.

DOCTOR X733
I don't see it on here.

PATIENT X733
Cause I come here in two weeks anyway to my psychiatry meeting @@@.

DOCTOR X733
Okay very good.

PATIENT X733
But uh at the end of this year DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.  And I could probably see what she wants to give.  I can talk to her about that.

DOCTOR X733
I don't see anything on here for your anxiety.

PATIENT X733
Oh really, really?

DOCTOR X733
No.  Yeah.

PATIENT X733
She gave me something @@@.

DOCTOR X733
Do you know what the name of it is?

PATIENT X733
Yeah I do but I can't pronounce the name of it, that's the problem with that.  But no but I got to call the rest in anyway and I can talk to her.

DOCTOR X733
Yeah I don't know why it's not on here.

PATIENT X733
So I think it's something like, from the muscle, it's got a muscle relaxer to it.

DOCTOR X733
Muscle relaxer that I see on here.

PATIENT X733
That's probably uh what's the name of it?

DOCTOR X733
Cyclobenzaprine?

PATIENT X733
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X733
But that's not for anxiety.

PATIENT X733
Yeah I know that.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.  I don't want you to take that for anxiety.

PATIENT X733
Oh no.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.  That's only because you're having spasms I think in your neck right?

PATIENT X733
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X733
Do you find yourself needing to take it?  I'm sorry if you feel like you need something for anxiety we could give you something better that's more appropriate.

PATIENT X733
Yeah I do need help, cause I do have an anxiety problem.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.

PATIENT X733
Yeah and if I could @@@ for my sinus that uh.

DOCTOR X733
The nasal spray?

PATIENT X733
Yeah that spray yeah.

DOCTOR X733
And @@@ medication.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
Yeah you definitely need both of those.

PATIENT X733
Alright yeah.

DOCTOR X733
Tell me, what makes you more anxious?

PATIENT X733
Actually you know when I'm trying to @@@.

DOCTOR X733
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X733
You know.  Like I feel really around you I guess I feel @@@ but when I get out @@@.  I'll shut it off, not so good you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X733
Is it easier when you're on the phone?

PATIENT X733
Uh.

DOCTOR X733
Or is it about the same for you?

PATIENT X733
Yeah it's about the same.  I don't talk; I don't like to talk too long on the phone normally.

DOCTOR X733
Have you ever tried anything in the past?

PATIENT X733
In the?

DOCTOR X733
In terms of medication for anxiety.

PATIENT X733
No, I don't know whatever they gave me see I don't know, whatever they done give me, that's all I been taking.  Because that's I was always like keeping it cause since that time I think that was having to drink and everybody around me was drinking cause I was more relaxed when I drank and you know more often I would @@@.
 
DOCTOR X733
So you were drinking a lot back then?

PATIENT X733
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X733
So it looks like you had four DUIs.

PATIENT X733
No it was just two.

DOCTOR X733
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X733
They got four.

DOCTOR X733
That is what the note says though.

PATIENT X733
Had four DUIs, not really.

DOCTOR X733
@@@.

PATIENT X733
@@@.

DOCTOR X733
Even one is too many.

PATIENT X733
Yeah I guess.

DOCTOR X733
Because you're putting yourself in danger and you're putting somebody else in danger.

PATIENT X733
Right.

DOCTOR X733
Right.

PATIENT X733
Right.

DOCTOR X733
You know seriously I really want you to go over to PAC.  I know you don't want to.  Cause here's the thing right, I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna be straightforward.  I mean I'm not hiding anything from you.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
I'm reading this note here when you went to go see the psychologist in October of this past year and you told me there's a lot going on so it's like you know at that time you were still using some cocaine.  Still drinking but not as much and you know you have some issues with the wife and you're worried about your job and I think the medication you were using at the time you feel like was working for you.

PATIENT X733
Yes.

DOCTOR X733
And I think that they would be the best people to help you with you with this cause my concern is go on the medications that we start for anxiety um uh they're not good for people who have had a history of drinking too much alcohol.

PATIENT X733
Right.

DOCTOR X733
It gets real complicated.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
So you know you're here, its 11 o'clock, you're not going into work today right?

PATIENT X733
Uh yeah I have to work today.

DOCTOR X733
Because they.

PATIENT X733
Yes.

DOCTOR X733
I think there are medications that can help you.

PATIENT X733
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X733
I think there are medications that are gonna make you feel a lot better.

PATIENT X733
@@@.

DOCTOR X733
And make you feel less anxious.

PATIENT X733
Yeah.

DOCTOR X733
And just let you you know go through life a little bit easier.

PATIENT X733
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X733
And I want you to get started on one of them.

PATIENT X733
Alright.

DOCTOR X733
Cause they're very, you know, I think if there's things that could help I think we should do it.  I don't think we should ever think twice about it.

PATIENT X733
Alright.

DOCTOR X733
You know so if you're coming in on Wednesday in the morning I think you know.  You know I know I'm not your regular doctor, I'm just.

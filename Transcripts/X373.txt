DOCTOR H481
Artificial tears they're right here.

PATIENT H481
Could they deliver them?  Probably not.

DOCTOR H481
In January they delivered them.

PATIENT H481
I didn't get them.

DOCTOR H481
They mailed them.

PATIENT X373
Huh.  I got the, what do you call that stuff, that spray to clean my eyes.

DOCTOR H481
Alright now when did you go to the ER, on the 13th of June?

DOCTOR H481
So he gave you dicloxacillin, an antibiotic.

PATIENT X373

DOCTOR H481
And used it for seven days?

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  And did you see the eye doctor at all?

PATIENT H481
No.

DOCTOR H481
I think you should see the eye doctor.

PATIENT H481
They're gonna give me an appointment, who knows when.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah but you need to see them though.  Did @@@.

PATIENT X373
I thought they did.

DOCTOR H481
Oh eyeglasses, so you've seen the eye doctors?

PATIENT H481
That was last year or.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah, so you're a patient of them.  If I was you I'd go down there because once you're a patient you have to call and make an appointment.

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
So go down there, make an appointment, tell them my eyes have been bothering me.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
And then they should give you a sooner than later appointment.

PATIENT X373
Yeah cause they told me to wait until December or January, something like that.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  Have you ever gotten shingles before?

PATIENT H481
No.

DOCTOR H481
Have you ever gotten the shingles vaccination?

PATIENT H481
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR H481
Have you refused it?

PATIENT H481
No, what it is?  What does it do?

DOCTOR H481
Well it's like chicken pox that old people get.

PATIENT X373
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
And usually.

PATIENT H481
If they gave it to me I don't know.  They give me all kinds of shots.

DOCTOR H481
No it doesn't look like they gave it to you.

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
Immunizations, nope.  So if you had chicken pox when you were a kid you can get chicken pox but it comes back like painful.

PATIENT H481
Okay.

DOCTOR H481
You know like you get a rash, you can get it anywhere in your body.

PATIENT X373
I don't even know if I had chicken pox.

DOCTOR H481
Oh you don't?

PATIENT H481
I know I had all my shots when I was growing up.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah but no one got chicken pox shots until my generation.

PATIENT H481
And then oh I might have when I went to the service though.

DOCTOR H481
No they.

PATIENT H481
They wouldn't give that @@@.

DOCTOR H481
They don't give it to you in the service yeah.

PATIENT X373
@@@ too bad.

DOCTOR H481
Um.

PATIENT H481
Well another thing is I got this letter from.

DOCTOR H481
So do you want the eye drops?

PATIENT H481
I got the stuff to clean my eyes.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.

PATIENT H481
But not.

DOCTOR H481
So you're talking about the antibiotic eye drops?

PATIENT X373
No I don't know.  But they were supposed to send me eye drops, I never got them.

DOCTOR H481
But didn't they, so you ordered, he ordered antibiotic eye drops.

PATIENT H481
No.

DOCTOR H481
And you never got them.

PATIENT H481
He gave me antibiotic pills.

DOCTOR H481
For seven days?

PATIENT H481
Right.

DOCTOR H481
But he didn't give you the eye drops at all.

PATIENT X373
I never got the eye drops.

DOCTOR H481
Let me see.  Did he even order it?  Take seven days, oh he never ordered the eye drops actually.

PATIENT H481
Okay that might explain it.

DOCTOR H481
He just gave you oral antibiotics.  Did he say he wanted you to get the eye drops that were antibiotics?

PATIENT H481
He said he was gonna do that and then to put the warm compresses on my eyes and all that.

DOCTOR H481
Has that been helping?

PATIENT H481
Hmm yeah I guess.  But still my eyes are still burning and stuff.

DOCTOR H481
But do you get the artificial tears at your house?

PATIENT X373
Yeah usually they deliver everything to the house.

DOCTOR H481
So you got the artificial tears?

PATIENT H481
No.  I got just the clean, to clean my eyes.

DOCTOR H481
Which ones, yeah let's go over your meds cause I think we're getting confused.  Are you taking this one?

PATIENT H481
Yeah that's my, whatever it's for.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT H481
@@@.

DOCTOR H481
What is it for?

PATIENT X373
I don't know.

DOCTOR H481
So you're taking that?

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
Okay are you taking these?

PATIENT H481
No.  Cause I didn't get them, that's the tears.

DOCTOR H481
Okay so you don't use anything okay this is your aspirin.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
And your Plavix.

PATIENT X373
Right.

DOCTOR H481
Fish oil.  Insulin.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
Insulin.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
Lisinopril for blood pressure.

PATIENT H481
Right.

DOCTOR H481
For blood pressure.  OCuSOFT lid scrub, that's the one you got.

PATIENT X373
That's the one I got right now, the new one.

DOCTOR H481
Alright.

PATIENT H481
But that, the lisinopril.  I stopped taking one of them.

DOCTOR H481
Why?

PATIENT H481
Cause they told me to.

DOCTOR H481
Who told you that?

PATIENT H481
You guys did.

DOCTOR H481
Let me see.

PATIENT X373
Should be on there.

DOCTOR H481
Let me see.

PATIENT H481
Cause they wanted to know why was I taking two, two blood pressure pills or something like that.

DOCTOR H481
Well no people can take two, three, four.

PATIENT H481
They told me no I shouldn't be taking them so they took them off.  I don't know if it was lisinopril or listopril or something like that.

DOCTOR H481
Let's see.  Pressure is not well controlled, so blood pressure was high.  Had to stop hydrochlorothiazide due to elevated creatinine.  So we stopped your hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
So we didn't stop the lisinopril but we stopped the hydrochlorothiazide.  Let me see if anybody else stopped it.  The Dietary didn't do anything.

PATIENT X373
It would be the diabetic doctors.

DOCTOR H481
Diabetes, previous Lantus, normotensive, on the ACE inhibitors which is lisinopril.  He didn't say to stop it.

PATIENT H481
Well somebody told me cause I know, cause I didn't even get it in the mail.  I know one of them I didn't get it no more.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT H481
That's the only one okay.

DOCTOR H481
That's the one I stopped.  Let's see what the ER doctor did.

PATIENT H481
So what's the other name of it then, the hydro whatever.

DOCTOR H481
Hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ.

PATIENT X373
What's that?

DOCTOR H481
Hydrochlorothiazide.  It's not on there cause I took it off.

PATIENT H481
But it's on here, oh no it's not.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT H481
And then that's the one I don't take.  I know you guys took one off for me and I say okay.

DOCTOR H481
It wasn't the lisinopril then.

PATIENT H481
No.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.

PATIENT X373
Uh maybe they call it listopril?

DOCTOR H481
No, no, no, lisinopril.

PATIENT H481
Okay.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  I knew no one else would have told you that.

PATIENT H481
Yeah I got the lid scrub.  One check, one more refill.

DOCTOR H481
Are you drinking water?

PATIENT H481
A lot of water.  Peeing every five minutes man.  Why is my water down?

DOCTOR H481
No your creatinine is still high.

PATIENT X373
What's that?

DOCTOR H481
That's for your kidneys.  And we already took and you weren't taking the hydrochlorothiazide anymore?

PATIENT H481
No.

DOCTOR H481
Cause you don't have any @@@ huh?

PATIENT H481
Nope.

DOCTOR H481
Can we ask your wife or your girlfriend?

PATIENT H481
Yeah.  It's right on there what I take on one of those pages.  Oh that's in March when they did the, put the drill bit and cleaned me out.  That's not in there; it's supposed to be in there.  

DOCTOR H481
But does she know which medicines you take other than @@@.

PATIENT X373
She should know.  She's the one that saves me all the time.

DOCTOR H481
Here we go.

PATIENT H481
So all of this is in there right?

DOCTOR H481
Huh?

PATIENT H481
All this is in there?

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.  But it's one thing to give you the medication and it’s one thing if you still had it at home and you've been taking it.  So you don't know which ones you're taking?

PATIENT H481
Not really.  I just take them cause there's some in the morning and there's some in the evening.

DOCTOR H481
Well your sugar is getting better.

PATIENT X373
Yeah just that when it drops, my reaction is eat a candy or something.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT H481
Instead of, but then when I overeat it goes up, if it's regular food it doesn't matter.  The sugar's gonna go up.

DOCTOR H481
Pull up @@@.

PATIENT H481
Well what do I do then?

DOCTOR H481
@@@.

PATIENT H481
I should check with the diabetes doctor but they give me a pharmacist though.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah, yeah.  Let's see, did you do the Hemoccult, the poop?

PATIENT H481
Yeah.  I did two of them.

DOCTOR H481
Okay let's see.  Okay it was, they said they couldn't do it.  This was in December.  They said it wasn't a good sample.

PATIENT H481
Right so they told me to send another one.

DOCTOR H481
Did you send another one?

PATIENT H481
Yeah cause they gave me a paper to come out here and get it.  Somebody gave me the card with that.  He said it wouldn't work so I had to do it again.

DOCTOR H481
There's all these labs I wanted you to get and you didn't get them.

PATIENT X373
What's that?

DOCTOR H481
Back in May.  I don't see any of these tests.  Anyway let's see, creatinine, phosphorus, there's no stool order.  Alright I'll have to do another one.  Since you don't want to get the colonoscopy right?

PATIENT H481
Do this?

DOCTOR H481
Yeah I'll put it in.

PATIENT H481
Another one?

DOCTOR H481
Yeah it wasn't in there.

PATIENT H481
Hmm.

DOCTOR H481
Look I'm putting it in in the lab right.

PATIENT X373
Okay.  What else do I have to do?

DOCTOR H481
@@@.

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
So do you drink alcohol?

PATIENT H481
No.  Coffee.

DOCTOR H481
You need blood pressure right.  Did they get another one?  It was 117/66.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh this morning oh yeah.

DOCTOR H481
Why didn't they put it in?

PATIENT X373
Hmm.

DOCTOR H481
But this was the second time they took it, it was 117?

PATIENT H481
The first time was 147.

DOCTOR H481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H481
They said the second one was real good, whatever.  

DOCTOR H481
Now I'll order the, the eye drops are already ordered so it's not like I could do anything.  I would call the Pharmacy and make sure they give you another one.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
And just let them know that you never got the one before that.

PATIENT X373
Yeah, it's weird that I didn't.  I got the, like I said I got the eye scrub but never got the drops cause they were supposed to come at the same time.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  Call them you can renew it.

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
It's there.  All you have to do is just call and have them send it to you okay.

PATIENT H481
Sounds like a plan.

DOCTOR H481
Alright so what are you gonna do?  You're gonna see the eye doctor right?

PATIENT H481
Yeah I guess I'll go down there and make an appointment.

DOCTOR H481
Go and make an appointment, call to get your eye drops cause they can send them out.  All you have to do is just call it.  So eye doctor, eye drops, do the stool cards and whenever you're able to come back you can just turn it in cause the lab is in there and what else?  Anything else going on?

PATIENT X373
Yeah how come I get headaches now?  My arm hurts and my neck hurts.  Just right here.

DOCTOR H481
When does it happen?

PATIENT H481
Every day, even now.

DOCTOR H481
Point to where your neck hurts.

PATIENT H481
Right in here.

DOCTOR H481
Does it hurt when you press on it?

PATIENT H481
No it's just like a steady pain.

DOCTOR H481
Do you sleep on your back or on your side or face down?

PATIENT X373
On my side.

DOCTOR H481
On your side.  Alright.  Have you tried sleeping with your face up?

PATIENT H481
Hmm not really.  I haven't done that in years.  @@@ as a matter of fact.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  So it's every day your neck hurts, alright.  Did you do anything heavy recently?

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh yeah.

DOCTOR H481
Where's your hand hurt?

PATIENT H481
In my arm.

DOCTOR H481
Did you hurt yourself?

PATIENT X373
No, no.

DOCTOR H481
Point to where it hurts.

PATIENT H481
All the way to here.  Right there yeah.

DOCTOR H481
Did you hurt yourself?  Right there.  Alright squeeze my hand, squeeze, alright.  Now go like this like you're gonna lift up some weight.  Does it hurt?

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
It hurts?

PATIENT H481
But I could still do it, yes that hurt.  But they sent me to therapy for this but it still.  It was okay and now it's starting to hurt again.

DOCTOR H481
Is it the same pain?

PATIENT X373
Yeah back here and over here.

DOCTOR H481
It was the same pain before?

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
It was the same pain.

PATIENT H481
And then my leg hurt down here.

DOCTOR H481
Let's see Occupational Therapy.

PATIENT H481
And it worked, she did it once and I don't know what was wrong but she got it straightened out quick.  I think her name was NAME the therapist.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah NAME.

PATIENT X373
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
Have you continued doing the therapy at home?

PATIENT H481
Yeah.  Well I do until it starts hurting then I stop.

DOCTOR H481
I think you need to start.

PATIENT H481
Same thing with walking.  I try to walk.

DOCTOR H481
This was just in June.

PATIENT H481
Right I try to walk and everything starts hurting again.  I'm hoping my legs.

DOCTOR H481
Are you doing, did you do the stretching today?

PATIENT X373
No.

DOCTOR H481
Did you do it in the last week?

PATIENT H481
Yeah.  I went, well I was gonna go Sunday but I couldn't because our basement was flooded in my house.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT H481
Where I live so I had to go upstairs and we had a plumber.

DOCTOR H481
Were you doing stuff, moving around?

PATIENT H481
No.  They don't let me do anything.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.

PATIENT X373
Cause they got a treadmill so I get on that treadmill and I walk on the treadmill.

DOCTOR H481
And you started getting pain in your arm?

PATIENT H481
Mostly my legs.  My neck I don't know why it just started out of the blue it started hurting.  It's been like that for a couple weeks now.

DOCTOR H481
Have you taken a Tylenol or anything?

PATIENT H481
No cause I take the aspirin in the morning with my pills.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah but the aspirin is more for your diabetes.

PATIENT H481
Right.

DOCTOR H481
And then you should take a Tylenol.

PATIENT X373
Take a regular Tylenol?

DOCTOR H481
Yeah like 600 or 650, whatever the dose is.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
I think they sell them 325, just take two of those.

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
And then see how you do when you're walking but I think you need to start stretching every day just like the physical therapist and if it doesn't help then you can call and let the nurse know that you want therapy or call the therapist.  Can you set up an appointment with the therapist?

PATIENT H481
I guess I could yeah.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT X373
I got her thing at home.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.  You could call her and ask her if she says that I have to order it again then call the nurse and let them know.

PATIENT H481
Well actually you didn't order it, it was the doctor DOCTOR.

DOCTOR H481
Oh the endocrinologist.

PATIENT H481
Right she's the one that ordered it.

DOCTOR H481
And then you felt better?

PATIENT H481
Yeah right away.  She was massaging and doing all kinds of crazy stuff and then right away it started working.

DOCTOR H481
But you've got to stretch every day then.

PATIENT X373
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  I think you've got to do everything they told you to do in therapy every day though.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
Okay and if it doesn't work then we might have to enroll you again for physical therapy. Alright so you're gonna stretch right?

PATIENT H481
Well yeah.

DOCTOR H481
And then try to take some Tylenol.

PATIENT H481
Right.

DOCTOR H481
And then if it doesn't work then you have to see therapy again.

PATIENT X373
Because I mean I'm walking even though it's killing me.  Like in my arm and my legs too, this leg.  And I walk cause they said you have to walk.  I says okay but shit I go a little bit then everything starts hurting.  And it's all on this side all the time the right side.

DOCTOR H481
Oh because you have peripheral vascular disease too.

PATIENT H481
Right.  What is that?  I got all kinds of good stuff.

DOCTOR H481
Did you get the CT run-off at all or no?

PATIENT H481
What's that?

DOCTOR H481
Because it looks like DOCTOR wanted you to have a run-off.

PATIENT H481
A run-off?

DOCTOR H481
Yeah basically a CT scan to look at your arteries.  They didn't do it right?

PATIENT X373
No.  They said because of the kidneys I wasn't drinking enough water or whatever.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT H481
But I think I did it at Rush.

DOCTOR H481
They did the run-off?

PATIENT H481
Because they.

DOCTOR H481
Back in January of when did you go to Rush?

PATIENT H481
In March or whenever it was.

DOCTOR H481
March 26th.

PATIENT X373
Because they did a procedure on me.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.  They did the run-off because.

PATIENT H481
And then they.

DOCTOR H481
When did you go to Rush?

PATIENT H481
What it's not in there and this is all @@@ I got to fill out for.

DOCTOR H481
No they did, they didn't put in another stent right?

PATIENT H481
No they just.

DOCTOR H481
They said you had mild, you didn't have like significant?

PATIENT X373
No they said, no in January or December they want me to go back and they want to check all my neck veins and everything.

DOCTOR H481
Well I could check them here.  Let's @@@.

PATIENT H481
I'd go with Medicare.

DOCTOR H481
Okay and they'll take care of the rest?

PATIENT H481
Yeah, Medicaid or whatever.

DOCTOR H481
Yes.

PATIENT H481
I could go to either one.  I can go here but they didn't want to do it last time so when I went to Rush and I told them that it was bothering me they just did it on this side first time and then when they put the stents they did it in my leg.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT X373
On this side.

DOCTOR H481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H481
Then when they put it on this side they what do you call that, whatever they do.

DOCTOR H481
You had a catheterization.

PATIENT H481
Right they did that again and they go it looks okay but we got to wait and see cause we're not sure.  I tell them whatever but this leg keeps hurting right along with my arm and everything.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.

PATIENT H481
And then I took the neck pain and my headaches and I've never had headaches, only when I had hangovers but I don't drink no more.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah.  Well I can order the carotid Dopplers.  It might take a few days or maybe a week.  It's up to you if you want me to go ahead and order it.

PATIENT X373
Yeah I can come over here.

DOCTOR H481
What's closer to your house?

PATIENT H481
Here.

DOCTOR H481
Here.

PATIENT H481
I live right down on xxx, right off of xxx.  Yeah I mean I could do that.  He said, he mentioned something that I might have to get another stent in my leg or something but I told him whatever you are the doctors I don't know.  I already got three.  And besides DOCTOR the guy who wrote to you, he's retired.

DOCTOR H481
Hmm.

PATIENT H481
So my cardiologist, so I don't know.  And the one that did the surgery I need there so that's a procedure it's not a surgery.  He's still there but.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah @@@.  Let me listen to your neck.  And they've never done surgery right?

PATIENT X373
No.

DOCTOR H481
On your neck.

PATIENT H481
No just on the back.  They did my back surgery but that was like a million years.  They did surgery on L5.

DOCTOR H481
Okay so then hopefully they set up the appointment on, I would let the clerk know.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  Would you be interested in, so you need to call about the drops.  And you wanted Dermatology?

PATIENT H481
Yeah they said they were gonna put me there for these stupid skin tags I got.  I got them all over the place, the neck and everything.

DOCTOR H481
Yeah I don't know if they'll take them off actually.

PATIENT X373
They said they would laser them or something.  I don't care I mean unless they got that tree oil stuff or whatever it's called.

DOCTOR H481
Probably be easy just to cut them off @@@.

PATIENT H481
Oh really?

DOCTOR H481
Yeah they just cut.

PATIENT H481
Whatever.  If they do it then, let's do the important things first.

DOCTOR H481
Okay you don't have to do that cause I'm ordering a lot already.

PATIENT H481
Yeah.

DOCTOR H481
So the carotid Dopplers um, vascular studies.

PATIENT X373
The skin tags I've had them, I don't know I just started getting that.

DOCTOR H481
Alright.  I'll have you come back in like three months.

PATIENT H481
Okay.

DOCTOR H481
Okay.  And then alright.  Do you want the, you don't know if you had chicken pox as a kid?

PATIENT H481
Yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR H481
Do you know if your brothers had it?

PATIENT H481
@@@.  I don't know.

DOCTOR H481
Remember when you were a kid.

PATIENT X373
No not that I know of.

DOCTOR H481
Hmm.  Okay, I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT H481
Okay.

DOCTOR OUT:  147:40  DOCTOR IN:  159:01

DOCTOR H481
Alright.  I want to order some labs for you in three months.

PATIENT H481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H481
That way I get the labs that I want because I had all these labs ordered on May.

PATIENT H481
And they didn't do them.

DOCTOR H481
Well they didn't do them because it was so long ago May, June, July, August, that's why.

PATIENT X373
Oh.

DOCTOR H481

PATIENT X608
No I need it.

DOCTOR X608
Let's see metformin um and that's pretty much the only one.  I thought that you were doing good with your diabetes.  Yeah last time we checked your A1c in September it was really good 6.2.  Okay um.  How many times a day do you check your sugars?

PATIENT X608
Once a day.

DOCTOR X608
Once a day okay.  Um and sometimes are they in the 100s?  Like 110 or they always like 200 something?

PATIENT X608
Sometimes they're in the 100s.

DOCTOR X608
Sometimes well okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X608
Usually I take it with the pills.

DOCTOR X608
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X608
Then I'll be fine.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah okay.  Okay um.  I'm going to make some notes; I'm going to put them in here.  Um okay, let's see alright so the other thing that sometimes we try for nerve pain like neuropathy.

PATIENT X608
Yeah.

DOCTOR X608
Is some medicine called gabapentin.  Have you ever tried that before?  It's a pill that you take three times a day and usually we start at the low dose and then increase it as you tolerate it um and it's supposed to help with nerve pain.  Um some people it helps, some people it doesn't.  I don't really know, you know we have no way of defining who it would.  Would you want to try that?

PATIENT X608
Okay.  You gave me; a doctor gave me some type of cream.

DOCTOR X608
Oh some what?

PATIENT X608
A type of cream.

DOCTOR X608
Oh some cream?

PATIENT X608
Yes.

DOCTOR X608
Okay.

PATIENT X608
A type of cream.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah, yeah, okay.

PATIENT X608
That @@@.

DOCTOR X608
Did that help?  Have you been trying it?

PATIENT X608
I'm trying it.

DOCTOR X608
Oh okay, okay.  Yeah cause that's supposed to help too with the neuropathy.

PATIENT X608
Yeah?

DOCTOR X608
Yeah definitely.  Everyone's different.  Some patients really like the cream, some people really like you know the gabapentin, it's a little bit different for everybody.   Do you want to try that first and if it doesn't work then we'll try the pills or do you want?

PATIENT X608
Yeah.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah let's do that.  You're on enough meds right now, so we'll just take it slow okay.  Um so it sounds like it's pretty painful so I don't want to like ignore it though.  Okay and then the other thing is the urination stuff.  You're going, so you're peeing a lot, what's the story?

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.  I don't need it but I drink a lot of coffee.

DOCTOR X608
Uh-huh, sure.  Uh how many times a night do you have to get up and use the bathroom?

PATIENT X608
About three or four.

DOCTOR X608
Three or four times a night.  That's interrupting your sleep isn't it?

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah um and uh have you noticed that there's any change in the strength of the stream?

PATIENT X608
No.

DOCTOR X608
No change in the.

PATIENT X608
No changes.

DOCTOR X608
Are you still, is it that you have to go and pee do you have to wait a while for it to start?

PATIENT X608
No.

DOCTOR X608
So it's just peeing frequently.

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X608
Any pain when you urinate?

PATIENT X608
No.

DOCTOR X608
No pain, that's good, that's good.  Um okay.  And yeah I mean definitely you're getting to the age where prostates do start interfering with men and so that's something we can take a look at too.  Um okay.  Let's see alright okay.  Anything else bothering you?

PATIENT X608
No, no.

DOCTOR X608
No okay.

PATIENT X608
@@@.

DOCTOR X608
I'll just get all this paperwork filled out.  What's the story at home?  Are you, you know do you do got to @@@ around the house or?

PATIENT X608

PATIENT X608

DOCTOR X608

PATIENT X608
Hmm.

DOCTOR X608
Okay, okay, good.  That's good.  Um do you guys need any help around the house?  Do you guys every have anyone come in like a homemaker or?

PATIENT X608
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X608
Home Health nurse or anything like that.  So you guys have it under control do you think?  Okay, okay that's good um okay great.  Well I'm going to do a physical exam.  I'm going to ask you when you're done to step outside.  Um you can wait in the hallway or in the waiting area either one and um I'll uh call you back when we're done.

PATIENT X608
Sit here?

DOCTOR X608
Yeah.  So I really want to check your prostate?   Have you had that done before?

PATIENT X608
No.

DOCTOR X608
It's really not pleasant.

PATIENT X608
@@@.

DOCTOR X608
What we do is uh I put, I put a finger in your rectum and feel you're prostate.

PATIENT X608
Oh.  I had that done; I had that done in the Army.

DOCTOR X608
Oh yeah, you've had them before, you know what it's like.  The main thing about it is that we can feel your prostate and I can feel if there are any lumps or bumps, I can feel if it's bigger than normal.

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X608
Um and it's something we should probably do so we'll do it now, so I don't want to do it for a while, that'll be good.  So it'll take only a second.  @@@.  Okay.  Alright.  So we'll start with the prostate exam.

PATIENT X608
@@@ too far you know.  @@@ prostate @@@.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah that's the best way.

PATIENT X608
I'm worried about that.  I had a friend of mine die from that.

DOCTOR X608
Oh really, I'm so sorry to hear that.

PATIENT X608
Yep.

DOCTOR X608
Okay.  Uh I just need you to drop your pants and turn around and face that way and lean forward okay.

PATIENT X608
Okay.  Right here.

DOCTOR X608
Okay now turn around over there, can you face the wall for me, that'll be good yeah.  There we go.  Okay.  Alright.  So if you lean forward a little bit, perfect.  Okay so you're gonna feel me spreading your cheeks with the outside and then you'll feel a cold finger okay.  Well yeah okay alright good.  All done.  I'm gonna come back @@@ so you can go ahead and clean up.  I'll be right back in okay.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  45:17  DOCTOR IN:  46:40)

DOCTOR X608
Are you ready?

PATIENT X608
Yeah I'm ready.

DOCTOR X608
Okay.

PATIENT X608
Come on in.

DOCTOR X608
Huh yeah.  You guys can come back in.  Okay.  Um @@@ yeah.  Okay.  Okay yeah, there you go.

PATIENT X608
@@@.

DOCTOR X608
Huh, um I'm doing residency here but I'm just going through @@@.

PATIENT X608
Oh.

DOCTOR X608
Did you hurt at all @@@.

PATIENT X608
@@@.

DOCTOR X608
Okay so uh basically, it didn't feel too crazy back there.

PATIENT X608
Hmm.

DOCTOR X608
That's a good thing um yeah so I think that uh, you the prostate might be a little bit big uh but I didn't feel any lumps or bumps so that's good.  That means you know probably less likely cancer.

PATIENT X608
Oh the prostate feels okay.

DOCTOR X608
Of cancer yeah.  We can also do a blood test to look for cancer, it's uh not 100% test so sometimes it comes back low and people still have it.  Sometimes it comes back high and people don't have it but usually if it comes back high we like to investigate more.  Um we need to just send people to the urologist.  So is it okay if we check that blood test on you?

PATIENT X608
Today?

DOCTOR X608
Uh-huh, yeah well if we do blood we're able to do it today.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

DOCTOR X608
Okay, okay.  Um everything else.

PATIENT X608
They always have problems getting my blood.

DOCTOR X608
They always have problems getting your blood?

PATIENT X608
Hmm.

DOCTOR X608
You're a hard stick.  We should give you and make you drink a bunch of water so your veins get all pumped up.  Yeah I know.  Everyone has their cross to bear, you got to @@@.

PATIENT X608
One guy he's no good at all and the other guy he's no good.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah.

PATIENT X608
But the young lady she always has problems.

DOCTOR X608
Okay.  Maybe you should try and get the guy.

PATIENT X608
@@@.  Okay.

DOCTOR X608
Maybe she just hasn't been doing it as long.  Is she younger? Maybe she's does a really good job.

PATIENT X608
I gotta do something.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X608
Do I go give blood right here?

DOCTOR X608
Yeah, let me just double check everything else so um yeah.  So we'll recheck a prostate test and then we'll check again your A1c level, that's to check how your diabetes is doing.  Um I think that we were good on um your cholesterol um so we were dealing with that with the pharmacist, so I don't know if we need to check that but um we'll see about that and then the other things is, so we're not gonna start the medicine for the nerves cause you're gonna try the stuff the podiatrist gave you.

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.  @@@ type of thing.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah, yeah.  Try that stuff and if that works then we won't bother with the gabapentin.  If it doesn't work, at your next visit, we'll try the gabapentin okay.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

DOCTOR X608
Then we're not trying like six things at once and we'll know what's working and what isn't.  Um and then did you get your flu shot this year?

PATIENT X608
No.

DOCTOR X608
No okay well, it won't do you any good now.  Uh okay and then the um other thing we want to double check on is the uh the urination stuff.  So we can start medicine for that um you know that helps with the prostate.

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X608
Um it might help you and so we might consider trying that, what do you think?

PATIENT X608
Okay.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah.  I think it would be nice if you didn't have to get up so many times at night you know.  I don't think it's just that you're drinking a lot of water cause you've probably been doing that for years you know and it's more recently that this stuff has been coming up.  So why don't we try, we'll try back on this.  Uh usually we start that medicine at a low dose and then we increase it over time okay.  I would prefer that and it'll say how like 1 mg one week and 2 the next and so forth okay. Uh okay and then you want to, um providing you know the labs return normal, we'll have you come back in like three, four months.

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X608
Um come back sooner if you need to, like if the salve doesn't work on your leg.

PATIENT X608
I'll be back on the 23rd.

DOCTOR X608
Oh the 23rd, for the xxx xxx?

PATIENT X608
No the A1 Clinic.

DOCTOR X608
Oh okay, okay.

PATIENT X608
The Coumadin.

DOCTOR X608
Yeah.  If you are not, if the salve isn't working on your foot you know, then come back and make an appointment to see us over here.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

DOCTOR X608
Come back and see me in like April or May.

PATIENT X608
Well I did, I made an appointment to see you.

DOCTOR X608
Oh okay.

PATIENT X608

(DOCTOR OUT:  51:09  DOCTOR IN:  59:45)

SECOND DOCTOR X608
Hi.  You have a lot of friends with you, all family with you.

PATIENT X608
Yeah, uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X608
@@@.  Okay PATIENT how are you?  Greetings.

PATIENT X608
I think I'll be alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X608
Two things um, the cholesterol medicine you're not taking any more so I don't know if you have the bottle at home or you ran out or what.

PATIENT X608
I think I ran out.  I called them about it.

SECOND DOCTOR X608
No we need to put the order in, so we're going to put the order in.  Um so but the cholesterol was pretty high last time it was checked so once you started taking it, it takes a couple of months to come back down so you do need to come and see our Pharmacy doctor in two months to make sure that its working and your cholesterol is down okay.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X608
Alright and then @@@ you already talk to the pharmacist @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
Okay, okay.  Thanks DOCTOR.  Oh okay.  So we're gonna do a few things today.  We're gonna do the blood work.

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
Um we're gonna have you schedule an appointment um for two months um with the Pharmacy and you know that's here in xxx xxx.  Have you seen her before in the Pharmacy?

PATIENT X608
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
Okay.  Um and that's just a follow-up on your cholesterol.  The clerk will make that appointment um.  But you have to stop and tell her to make it.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

DOCTOR X608
And then go to the lab to do the blood work and then um we're gonna restart the cholesterol medicine.  Do you want to pick them up at the Pharmacy or do you want us to mail it to you?

PATIENT X608
They can mail it to me.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
Mail it to you okay.  So we're gonna mail you.

PATIENT X608
I called in for that and they told me it was on the way.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
Oh never came huh.

PATIENT X608
No.

DOCTOR X608
I'm sorry about that.  It might be our fault that we didn't reorder enough of it or something you know and maybe it wasn't in there so we're gonna be putting you back on the same thing you were on simvastatin 80 mg each night and um then the other thing we're gonna mail you is the medicine for the prostate to see if that helps.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
And that's called tamsulosin.  There's actually two medicines that we can use for the prostate, I don't know, you know if you've seen the commercials for them.  But one of them also can lower your blood pressure so we're not starting that one because your blood pressure's already good you know.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
So um, so usually you use those daily, I that'll do it so, yeah at bedtime so we'll start you on @@@.  Okay.  Alright, so here's the plan.  Appointment with the Pharmacy in uh two months, make that appointment today, go to the Lab and give blood and then we'll mail you those medicines and start taking them okay.

PATIENT X608
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X608
And then you'll come back and see us in the clinic in like three or four months.  We'll mail you a letter.  Um and to let you know I'm graduating so I won't be here after May.

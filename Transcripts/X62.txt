DOCTOR X62
I don't think we can do anything right now.  The only thing that you should follow up is with the skin doctors because this was a little atypical and see if there's anything that changes with that.

PATIENT X62
That's why they took another biopsy; they went deeper this time and just did a lot more.

DOCTOR X62

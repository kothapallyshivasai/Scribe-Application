DOCTOR X262
PATIENT?  

PATIENT X262
How you doing? 

DOCTOR X262
Doing fine.  How are you?

PATIENT X262
Fine.

DOCTOR X262
@@@ sir.

PATIENT X262
Alright.

DOCTOR X262
Good to see you.

PATIENT X262
Good to be seen.

DOCTOR X262
Come on back.

PATIENT X262
Uh.  So you're not way in back anymore?

DOCTOR X262
Yeah there's, you know, moving and shaking it.

PATIENT X262
Okay, where do you want me?

DOCTOR X262
Right here is fine.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
How are you?

PATIENT X262
Alright.

DOCTOR X262
How you been doing?

PATIENT X262
Good.

DOCTOR X262
Good.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
So let's see, what's new?

PATIENT X262
Not too much.  No problems, no pain, no aches.

DOCTOR X262
Good.  So um, let's see I wanted to get some labs um this morning to check the.

PATIENT X262
I know I've been down there.

DOCTOR X262
I saw that.  So, yeah I know where it is, okay it's a little lower than before, 3.05, the last one was 2.48.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
Uh so it's still therapeutic.  Um did you eat this morning?

PATIENT X262
Yeah, well I've had some small rolls.

DOCTOR X262
Some rolls.

PATIENT X262
Uh with cinnamon and nut you know.

DOCTOR X262
So.

PATIENT X262
But uh.

DOCTOR X262
Your sugar today was 226 which is not very good.  But you ate this morning.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
And you got send a fasting specimen.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
It might have been less.  The problem is the number that I really wanted was this glycosylated hemoglobin, that's the hemoglobin A1c number.  It's still good but its still; it's still running in lab because that's the number that tells us how you've been doing with your sugars over a three months span.

PATIENT X262
Hmm.  Oh.

DOCTOR X262
So it's our best way to see you know where you're at.

PATIENT X262
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X262
Your last one, cause when did I see you last?

PATIENT X262
Couple months ago.

DOCTOR X262
Was it in February?

PATIENT X262
I think.

DOCTOR X262
It was 9.9, which is high and you want to be below 7.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
And your last one was 8.7 so depending on how you've been doing; we may have to change up some of your medications uh today, because you weren't taking the metformin right?

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
So we switched you to the longer acting, just the one dose but 1000 mg right?

PATIENT X262
I guess.

DOCTOR X262
Have you been taking it?

PATIENT X262
No.

DOCTOR X262
No.  Why?

PATIENT X262
Uh I don't know.  I was still getting the diarrhea.

DOCTOR X262
Even this one?

PATIENT X262
No I haven't taken this one yet.

DOCTOR X262
So I thought we talked about this last time that the reason we switched this one.

PATIENT X262
I didn't know we switched, I thought I was still doing the regular metformin.

DOCTOR X262
No this one, remember we said we were gonna give you the one that was one pill 1000 mg because it has been shown to have less GI side effects, less diarrhea than the other one.

PATIENT X262
Oh okay.  Alright.

DOCTOR X262
So did they send those to you?

PATIENT X262
Yeah I got them.

DOCTOR X262
Yeah and you just didn't take them.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  So we definitely want to try that.

PATIENT X262
Okay.  Oh I got confused.  I guess I wasn't aware of that.

DOCTOR X262
Yeah.

PATIENT X262
That you changed the pill.

DOCTOR X262
Right.  So uh you know I.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
You definitely want to try that.

PATIENT X262
Alright.

DOCTOR X262
Because I'm guessing since you are not taking it, your hemoglobin level, the sugar levels going to be real high.  

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
And you're still taking the glyburide right?

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
10 twice a day and what else, that's it right?

PATIENT X262
No.  Carvedilol or whatever.

DOCTOR X262
Well no for diabetes, just the.

PATIENT X262
Oh.

DOCTOR X262
The carvedilol.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
The aspirin, the albuterol when you need it, the inhaler.

PATIENT X262
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X262
The Combivent medicine or Combivent inhaler.  The metformin, the lisinopril, that should be it and you probably take the Coumadin.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
And the Coumadin.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  Otherwise how you been doing?

PATIENT X262
Fine, no problems.

DOCTOR X262
Another thing that we had to do was the Sleep Clinic.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Just because we had talked about that, but you cancelled your appointment and said you didn't want to be seen.

PATIENT X262
Yeah I, I don't.

DOCTOR X262
So what happened?

PATIENT X262
Uh well I wasn't sure you know.  Like I say um I can't see where that's gonna be any benefit to me.  I mean I'm you know, I sleep fine.

DOCTOR X262
Well yeah, you do sleep fine but uh the problem is that the last sleep study that you had showed concern for a type of sleep apnea that we call central sleep apnea which could be a result of the previous strokes, cause you've had strokes in the past right?

PATIENT X262
In 2002 I had two strokes, that's the only strokes I've had.

DOCTOR X262
So you know that's what is very important for your future health.  We want to make sure that you in fact need it and that's why I wanted to do the sleep study test.  You know what I'm saying?

PATIENT X262
Yeah.  Well like I said I know a lot of people that have CPAPs and that uh, they don't use them anymore.  They put it aside.

DOCTOR X262
But that's that could be fine for them.

PATIENT X262
And uh.

DOCTOR X262
But you have different reasons why you need it.

PATIENT X262
Well also too uh one reason was the guy said it costs me $1000 and I ate got that kind of money.

DOCTOR X262
That's what he told you?

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  Well I'm sure there are ways that we could subsidize that through the VA or something.  I'll have to look into that.

PATIENT X262
Right, well that's what the guy told me and that's why I said.

DOCTOR X262
I still think it, I still think it'd be worthwhile for you to be seen in that clinic but you're not interested at all?

PATIENT X262
No I'm not.  I'm not really interested in it.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  Um because you know just so you know the danger of sleep apnea is you know increased blood pressure and um it can have effects on your lungs and your heart that can be, you know and given your diabetes and you're already uh history of heart failure and things like that, those are.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
You know what I mean it's uh; it will worsen those things if not treated.  So I just want you to be aware of that.

PATIENT X262
Yeah right, I know.

DOCTOR X262
And it's, you know, it's ultimately your decision what you do.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
But I just want you to know.

PATIENT X262
I just as soon forget it.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  Um and I saw that you saw the uh, you were seen in the Podiatry Clinic.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Did they fix up your toes a little bit better?

PATIENT X262
Yeah, yeah.  I got to go back to them.

DOCTOR X262
Three months.

PATIENT X262
Oh three months from then.

DOCTOR X262
Oh from when they saw you.

PATIENT X262
From when they saw me.

DOCTOR X262
So um the only other thing is a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
And uh they wanted me to let you know that you are at a little bit higher risk for that procedure um because of the sleep apnea, because of your COPD.  When they sedate you, uh sometimes it's just a little bit more dangerous um in those people because of your previous heart condition and your previous lung @@@.

PATIENT X262
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR X262
But they monitor all those things.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
They just want you to be aware of that.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
They wanted me to document that I talked to you about that.

PATIENT X262
Right.  Well when you say um a risk or whatever uh, I've never heard that before on a colonoscopy about being uh.

DOCTOR X262
Well because, it's because of the medicines that they give you to sedate you.  Um you know because you have the previous stroke and the atrial fibrillation and the COPD and the heart failure and the sleep apnea, you know it sometimes, the sedation is dangerous, it can depress your drive to breathe and sometimes will require people to be intubated you know.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
And that's the danger with that and so um, you know I wanted to make you aware of that and uh.

PATIENT X262
Well when you think about the risk.

DOCTOR X262
Right it's definitely increased because of your uh, you know underlying conditions.  I'm going to talk with my attending about it today and see.

PATIENT X262
Well.

DOCTOR X262
What he thinks but I.

PATIENT X262
Yeah well if I don't have a colonoscopy I mean there's a risk too.

DOCTOR X262
There's a risk of that too obviously.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
So I mean unfortunately you're a little bit between a rock and a hard place.  I think that, I think you'd probably be fine.  They like to be sure uh that we're comfortable with that.  So that's the only problem.

PATIENT X262
Well you'd be a better judge of that than I am.

DOCTOR X262
No absolutely.  Um and that's the only problem with the sleep apnea too is the fact that you're not using the CPAP at all so it puts you at a higher risk than.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Someone that you know what I mean so, so.

PATIENT X262
I'll take a shot what the hell.  If I die, I die.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  Well I don't.

PATIENT X262
I'm a Catholic, I that's just the beginning.

DOCTOR X262
Fair enough but uh I think we would obviously want to prevent that.

PATIENT X262
I know I would like to prevent it too.

DOCTOR X262
And I don't think that it will, I don't think it would come to that but uh.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
I'll ask my attending to make sure he's comfortable with it, but I think.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
It should be okay.

PATIENT X262
Alright.

DOCTOR X262
Otherwise you're good on your meds?

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
You have all your refills and things?

PATIENT X262
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Any recent weight changes, headaches, vision changes, fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, things like that?

PATIENT X262
No.

DOCTOR X262
Doing okay otherwise?

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  Um cause the last time you said that your energy level had been down over the past six months to a year, do you still feel that way?

PATIENT X262
Yeah I'm 63.  I mean that's the problem with getting older.  You don't know, something happens and you don't know, is this something to be concerned about or is this just part of the aging process?

DOCTOR X262
Yeah.

PATIENT X262
I mean there's no book on aging.

DOCTOR X262
Right.  I definitely think that some of your uh fatigue is probably caused from the sleep apnea.

PATIENT X262
Uh.

DOCTOR X262
And so you know you can expect to be a little tired because you know, understand again what happens is that your throat closes when you're sleeping.

PATIENT X262
Oh.

DOCTOR X262
Because of the restriction of your neck.

PATIENT X262
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X262
You stop breathing.

PATIENT X262
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X262
But your body wakes you up enough that it allows you to take a deep breath but it doesn't actually wake you up so you don't know this is happening.  So um, so you never get into the dream state of sleep and so you wake up real tired.

PATIENT X262
Oh.

DOCTOR X262
The only way, unfortunately, to correct that is to use the CPAP machine.

PATIENT X262
Yeah well.

DOCTOR X262
And you're not interested in that.

PATIENT X262
No.

DOCTOR X262
So then there will be a component of fatigue.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
And uh but um no shortness of breath, no sore throats, no weakness in your legs, you know urinating, moving your bowels okay, no problems?

PATIENT X262
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Your vision's okay?

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Good.  Well have a seat up here I'm just going to take a quick listen to you and then have a seat.  What else is new, anything?

PATIENT X262
Nothing really.

DOCTOR X262
What'd you give up for Lent?

PATIENT X262
Nothing (laughter).  I didn't tell you I was a devout Catholic.

DOCTOR X262
Yeah.  Deep breaths.  Again, again, one more.  Okay.  Are you losing any weight at all?

PATIENT X262
Uh no.

DOCTOR X262
No, are you trying?

PATIENT X262
No.  I'm not back to when I had my stroke @@@.

DOCTOR X262
How much do you weigh now?

PATIENT X262
250.  I tell you, I don't eat a lot uh you know.

DOCTOR X262
Yeah.  Alright uh yeah, so the glycosylated hemoglobin number is 10, up from 9.9 so you're headed in the wrong direction.  But if you haven't been taking the metformin.

PATIENT X262
I'll start taking it.

DOCTOR X262
Cause the problem is that if you don't take the metformin, the next thing to do is insulin shots.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
And uh do you want me to just switch to that now?

PATIENT X262
No.

DOCTOR X262
Cause that's where we're heading.  The problem is that if we don't get your sugars under control, um we're going to put you on insulin.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
You know what I mean so.  We really need to get the metformin going but.

PATIENT X262
Uh no like I said I'll do a better job of my sugar intakes.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.  But you're also; I think your body is just to the point where it needs medicine anyway.  It's not, I mean you still need to monitor your sugar intake, you know low carbs, no; you know less bread, less pastas all that stuff.

PATIENT X262
Right, right.

DOCTOR X262
Um but um your body needs help now because your pancreas is kind of shot at this point and so uh we need to give you these medicines to help.  So it's really important that you do take that metformin.

PATIENT X262
Okay, I'll take it when I get home.

DOCTOR X262
And let me know, if it's still not working.  You know and you're still getting the diarrhea.

PATIENT X262
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X262
And things like that then we may have to switch you to the insulin.

PATIENT X262
Alright.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
Alright.  Let me chat with them in the clinic and I'll be right back.

PATIENT X262
Okay, okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  58:16  DOCTOR IN:  67:24)

DOCTOR X262
Okay, well you know I spoke to my attending and looking back at you know.  The reason we were doing colonoscopy is because you've never had it before.

PATIENT X262
Yeah.

DOCTOR X262
The truth is that the stool cards you've had uh in the past were negative.  You do have a lot of risks.  I don't want to even mess with it so let's do the stool cards like you did before.

PATIENT X262
Alright.

DOCTOR X262
You know how to do these and everything?

PATIENT X262
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
And then uh I would like you to follow up in 3-4 weeks with one of our pharmacists here, just to make sure that the medication's working okay, that metformin.

PATIENT X262
Okay.

DOCTOR X262
Um uh because I don't want you to go and not be taking the pill.

PATIENT X262
Right.

DOCTOR X262
Just because of the side effects.

PATIENT X262
Alright.  Okie doke.

DOCTOR X262
And then um you know uh that's about it and I'll see you in three months.

PATIENT X262
Okay.  Take it easy doc.

DOCTOR X262
Alrighty.  This is for you.

PATIENT X262
Oh.

DOCTOR X262
It's something for when you check out.

PATIENT X262
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X262
Okay.

PATIENT X262
Yeah take it easy.

DOCTOR X262
Thanks.

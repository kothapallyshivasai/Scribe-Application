Just fine, fine.

DOCTOR X685
Going well?

PATIENT X685
Yeah.

DOCTOR X685
And when was your last drink?

PATIENT X685
Oh um well I had a very tiny bit on a field trip during the program.

DOCTOR X685
When was that?

PATIENT X685
Uh let's see that was around the 10th I believe.

DOCTOR X685
Tell me how that happened.

PATIENT X685
Uh it was a crazy field trip.  It was what they call um uh, what do they call that thing; it was a National Guard thing.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685
Um @@@ down.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685
And a lot of homeless veterans show up in that and it's kind of a party atmosphere and in line I drank a bit.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685
And uh they were going to throw me out of the program.

DOCTOR X685
Yeah.

PATIENT X685
They put me in the nut ward on 7 for seven days and let me back in the program.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.  And you stopped the drinking, I mean how do you feel about @@@ are you committed since then?

PATIENT X685
Yeah I'm trying to, I mean I don't think the, I think the program's flawed because they had four @@@ just in the first 21 days I was there.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685
In the first 21 days, four @@@ failed inpatient, to me that didn't seem like a normal inpatient program.

DOCTOR X685
I'd much rather @@@ deal with it @@@.

PATIENT X685
Okay but from what I understand most programs, at least 21 days before you can see the outside walls but anyway um I am committed.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685
But I was standing in line for five hours with a bunch of homeless drunks and so on with bottles in their pockets and that's pretty tempting you know.

DOCTOR X685
I know that's tempting.

PATIENT X685
I'm not justifying it but.

DOCTOR X685
Alright.

PATIENT X685
I did it.

DOCTOR X685
You did it.

PATIENT X685
And I spent seven days on the nut ward for it.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.  Otherwise any shakes, any tremors?

PATIENT X685
Oh no, no, I had no DTs or anything.

DOCTOR X685
Any hallucinations?

PATIENT X685
No, no.  No I did my uh I did my detox before I went into the program.

Seems to be getting better.  I'm gonna take my jacket off.  

DOCTOR X685
Huh.

PATIENT X685
It took so long to actually see the doctor cause I missed another appointment.

DOCTOR X685
Well I looked over your labs uh from last month.  Everything looked pretty good.  The only thing we haven't had from you in a while is a cholesterol panel.

PATIENT X685
Okay.

DOCTOR X685
You haven't had it for about a year so I need you to go and get that to make sure everything is good.

PATIENT X685
Is that all you do today?

DOCTOR X685
I mean, um this is a fasting blood test, did you have lunch today?  Well we can get it some other time, at your convenience.

PATIENT X685
I've never had high cholesterol.

DOCTOR X685
You haven't uh.

PATIENT X685
I doubt that's an issue.

DOCTOR X685
But we need to get it at least one a year @@@.

PATIENT X685

DOCTOR X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685

Every day?

PATIENT X685
Yeah. But uh it's not very often anymore but it's the same feeling.  I don't know what that would be but.

DOCTOR X685
Is it always on that one side?

PATIENT X685
Right here, it's a shooting pain that way.

DOCTOR X685
And it's only on the right side?

PATIENT X685

DOCTOR X685
I'm not quite sure.

PATIENT X685
I mean.

DOCTOR X685
Any numbness or tingling?

PATIENT X685

DOCTOR X685
Do you still smoke?

PATIENT X685

PATIENT X685
But if you want to um prescribe me some um, I'm suppose to ask you to prescribe me Nicorette.

DOCTOR X685

PATIENT X685
So I've been putting the weight back on but I can't go overboard if I do it, it does cause me some problems.

DOCTOR X685

PATIENT X685
I think I'm in good shape. The nurses said to get the Nicorette and I need um and I should get a stronger dose, that's what the doctor up on 9 said cause it.

DOCTOR X685

DOCTOR X685
Um.

PATIENT X685
I think I'm doing better.

DOCTOR X685
Right.

PATIENT X685

DOCTOR X685

DOCTOR X685
Right.

PATIENT X685

DOCTOR X685

PATIENT X685
And I don't know if it’s from the detoxing or what but it's hard, it's painful, they are deep under the skin, it's not surface.

DOCTOR X685
So yeah we'll talk with them and see what they say.

PATIENT X685
That's what I'll talk with them.  I'm serious.

DOCTOR X685

DOCTOR X685
Uh so we're not gonna make any changes right now.

PATIENT X685
Good.

DOCTOR X685
Um otherwise the soonest you need to come back, probably a couple months after the program's done here to check up on you to make sure.

PATIENT X685

DOCTOR X685
Yes they'll give you a call.

PATIENT X685

DOCTOR X685
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X685
Um I am able to get back to sleep.

DOCTOR X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685
But um is there any kind of a sleeping pill that would.

DOCTOR X685
If you're able to get back to sleep the sleeping pills aren't really the ones that we would use for that situation.

PATIENT X685
Oh okay, alright.  I @@@.

DOCTOR X685
Are you having like nightmares?

PATIENT X685
I don't know, I don't know.

DOCTOR X685
Bring it up to the Psychiatry people up there too since to see if there's anything special but if you're able to go back to sleep and you're able to actually fall asleep I don't recommend any further sedating medicine.

PATIENT X685
Well I.

DOCTOR X685
@@@.

PATIENT X685
Oh I know that.

DOCTOR X685
That's why I don't want to give you medication for that right now.

PATIENT X685
Alright.  I've had insomnia my entire life.  That's a lot of the reason why I drank so much.

DOCTOR X685
But I think once you stop drinking then we'll see how the insomnia goes.

PATIENT X685
Alright.  Uh I think that's it, alright.

DOCTOR X685
Alright sir.  @@@.

PATIENT X685
No, no.

DOCTOR X685
@@@.

PATIENT X685
Oh I have kind of heavy white nasal discharge early in the morning.

DOCTOR X685
That's a postnasal drip situation, @@@ laying down a lot and when you wake up @@@.

PATIENT X685
It comes out but it's ridiculously thick and it's white.

DOCTOR X685
I can give you a nasal spray to help.

PATIENT X685
What's that?

DOCTOR X685
A nasal spray to help clear it up.

PATIENT X685
Is it something I should use?

DOCTOR X685
I don't, you can try it temporarily just to see if it helps clear it up.

PATIENT X685
Okay.

DOCTOR X685
Yeah I can put that in for you.

PATIENT X685
Okay.  And I should be able to pick up the uh Nicorette, nasal sprays.

DOCTOR X685
It should all be there.

PATIENT X685
How long do you think I should give the Pharmacy?

DOCTOR X685

PATIENT X685
Oh I should get a number first and.

DOCTOR X685
Yeah, yeah you should get a number.

PATIENT X685
Okay.

PATIENT X685
Alright cause otherwise the nurses are gonna cut me off on the Nicorette because even though I still have some in my box up there, they're gonna say I don't have a prescription so I can't have any more.

DOCTOR X685
Yep it's in there.

PATIENT X685
Alright cool.

DOCTOR X685

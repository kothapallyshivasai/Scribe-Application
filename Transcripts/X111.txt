PATIENT X111
No I'm all out.

DOCTOR X111
Oh okay.  Um how long have you been out of the omeprazole?

PATIENT X111
Oh I've been out of that one since February.

DOCTOR X111
Well that may be why uh you're having heartburn.

PATIENT X111
Yeah probably.

DOCTOR X111
So.

PATIENT X111
Yeah the only thing I've been on is the aspirin and that's it.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah.  You're not taking the Synthroid either.

PATIENT X111
No every thing’s run out, I ran out.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  Um okay.  You got to call us or call me and I can put in refills for you.  Um you know we do like to see you, you know probably at least every six months just to make sure the medications, you're on the right doses and everything.

PATIENT X111
Right, right.

DOCTOR X111
But uh some of the medications, like especially the Synthroid um you shouldn't just stop.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
It kind of regulates your thyroid and your thyroid can slow down and it can cause a lot of problems including it can put you in like a coma like state.

PATIENT X111
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X111
It's pretty rare but.

PATIENT X111
Well when I called in to have it refilled they said no you're done, you're done I said well you know.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
@@@ way of getting hold of you but its okay.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah I'm sorry about that.

PATIENT X111
It's okay.  Now what do I do here?

DOCTOR X111
Uh so basically this is just for you to read.

PATIENT X111

DOCTOR X111
And if you have a living will, power of attorney and that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X111
Yeah I got a living will.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
I just said yes.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah the last time I saw you was last March.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
And those prescriptions expire after a year.

PATIENT X111
Right and from the other doctor.

DOCTOR X111
So you cut your hand back in February?

PATIENT X111
Yeah it was just my finger.

DOCTOR X111
How's that going?

PATIENT X111
When I cut it I think I don't they put something on there and then it just flared up and then all of a sudden it was infected.

DOCTOR X111
Doing better now?

PATIENT X111
Yeah I squeezed it and got the pus out of it and that was it.  Okay is that all they need?

DOCTOR X111
Whatever happened with the colonoscopy and the biopsies they did?  Did they ever call you back?

PATIENT X111
No.  But my next one won't be for maybe another ten years they said.  @@@.

DOCTOR X111
They said next one in ten years?

PATIENT X111
About that yeah.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
No red flags, every thing’s all good and I said okay.  That's the last time I heard from them.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  Yeah the pathology on it looks good.

PATIENT X111
Oh that's good.

DOCTOR X111
No other problems, complaints, doing well?  Nothing today?

PATIENT X111

DOCTOR X111
No chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X111

DOCTOR X111
Take a deep breath.  Breathe normal.  Open your mouth, say ah.
Is your nose always kind of red like that?

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
Okay does it ever bother you?

PATIENT X111
No, just from my hay fever you know.

DOCTOR X111
Oh okay.  Kind of looks like something we call rosacea, it's not really serious but.  What happened here?

PATIENT X111
What this scar?

DOCTOR X111
Yeah.

PATIENT X111
Oh that was way back in the 70s, I had an operation done in Oklahoma when I was kid to take a cyst out.

DOCTOR X111
Oh okay.

PATIENT X111
And then I got on a fight on the school bus, somebody busted the stitches open.

DOCTOR X111
Oh.

PATIENT X111
When they went back in and tried to repair it and then the tornado hit in Oklahoma at that time, back in the 60s and I never went back to them.

DOCTOR X111
Oh.  Lay back for me.  No problems with that ever?

PATIENT X111
No.

DOCTOR X111
Oh okay.  You said you're eating fine.

PATIENT X111
Uh-huh.  

DOCTOR X111
Okay you can sit up.  Any weight loss at home?

PATIENT X111
No.

DOCTOR X111
Bowel movements are okay?

PATIENT X111
Yeah so far.

DOCTOR X111
No more dark ones.  I saw that you were in the ER a month or two ago and thought you had dark bowel movements.

PATIENT X111
Yeah that was because of my iron I think it was.

DOCTOR X111
@@@.

PATIENT X111
Yeah and I was taking @@@ and every thing’s fine.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  You still taking the iron?

PATIENT X111
Uh no.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  Are you out of it?  You're not taking it because you are out of it?

PATIENT X111
Oh no.

DOCTOR X111
@@@.

PATIENT X111
No I might have just @@@.  

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
I quit taking it.  I'm taking a multivitamin.

DOCTOR X111
Which is not as strong.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.  Which worked just as well so I was hoping to get my blood, my iron level and see how my iron is doing and my cholesterol.

DOCTOR X111
Well your blood counts are great.  They're normal. They did those when you were here in February.

PATIENT X111
Okay well that's good.

DOCTOR X111
Um.  We need to check your cholesterol today.  I'm going to check your thyroid levels.  Uh and you haven't taken the Synthroid since when?

PATIENT X111
Uh February.

DOCTOR X111
Okay you haven't taken anything since February?

PATIENT X111
No just aspirin.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
I think I might have taken little purple pills but I take them for a blood pressure.

DOCTOR X111
What's that?

PATIENT X111
It's the purple pills, I don't know what their called but they're tablets.  They're for night.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
I take those.  I still got a couple left.

DOCTOR X111
And you said you're walking okay.

PATIENT X111
Yeah, yeah, fine.  I don't walk really that far far, I do my little stroll.

DOCTOR X111
You walk up stairs without a problem?

PATIENT X111
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X111
Any more urinary tract infections?

PATIENT X111
No, so far.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  And I know you were having a problem with that.

PATIENT X111
Yeah I don't know what, all of a sudden it just comes up like that and then I take the antibiotic and I'm fine.

DOCTOR X111
Where do you live sir?

PATIENT X111
I live in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X111
xxx xxx.

PATIENT X111
Yeah down south.  About an hour away from here.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  I'm assuming you've eaten today right?

PATIENT X111
Yeah I had some Egg McMuffins @@@.  Yeah I had Mcxxxs earlier.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
About 10 o'clock or so.

DOCTOR X111
That's probably going to skew your cholesterol levels uh, especially Mcxxxs it's got a lot of cholesterol in it.

PATIENT X111
Oh.

DOCTOR X111
Uh maybe can you come back some time this week or next week and get the blood draws done in the morning before you eat?

PATIENT X111
Well I like to give that in xxx xxx.  Cause it takes me at least an hour to get up here.

DOCTOR X111
Does it really?

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
Is there a VA in xxx xxx?

PATIENT X111
Yeah I can get that outpatient patient there over on 95th Street.  

DOCTOR X111
Yeah if they can do it there.  Is it through xxx?

PATIENT X111
Yeah.  They can draw blood there.

DOCTOR X111
Okay that's fine then.  Yeah if I put the order in here then they should be able to get it.

PATIENT X111
They should get it there and I can get.

DOCTOR X111
All I want to check is just your cholesterol levels and your thyroid, make sure your thyroid is doing okay because you haven't taken the thyroid pill since February.  Okay, otherwise are you feeling good?

PATIENT X111
Yeah I'm feeling alright.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  Let me be right back.

PATIENT X111
Yeah I can't any more time off of work right now.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  Yeah go to xxx xxx @@@ that's fine.

PATIENT X111
Yeah if I can get in, I just call them and you know they usually draw my blood.

DOCTOR X111
Where you working, remind me?

PATIENT X111
Oh BBC Passengers over there in xxx.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  @@@.  Stay tuned and I'll be right back with you.

PATIENT X111
Oh okay alright.

DOCTOR X111
I'll drop this off while I'm out.

PATIENT X111
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  105.0  DOCTOR IN:  109:40)

DOCTOR X111
Uh so I want to check your blood today before um we start any, specifically the Synthroid, um the thyroid medication.  Just to see how your thyroid level is doing.  Um we'll check that.  It should be back to me by the end of the week and I can give you a call and tell you if you need to restart it or not.  Um we should restart probably all the other stuff, at least the cholesterol medications um.  Do you check your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT X111
No.

DOCTOR X111
No.  Can you get a blood pressure medication and check it at home?

PATIENT X111
Uh they just took my blood pressure and it was 138/75.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah it was good, 138/72 um which is good.  What I'm wondering is that's pretty good but your blood pressure can change.  Uh you're on some blood pressure medications at home.

PATIENT X111
Hmm.

DOCTOR X111
And I'm wondering if we need to keep you on them or not.  That's why it's important you know it's important to get you here every couple of months so we can check your blood pressure.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
I don't want to have you on blood pressure medications that you don't need.  At the same time I don't want to stop the blood pressure medications cause your blood pressure looks good today and then find out that you normally run 165 at home or something like that.

PATIENT X111
Right, right.

DOCTOR X111
But I think it would be best, it'd be best for you, to be honest, if you got a blood pressure cuff and was checking your blood pressure regularly at home.  For the sole reason that if you don't need to be on medication that you're taking, one less medication you have to take.  That's one less hassle you have to deal with.

PATIENT X111
Yeah I don't have one of those machines.

DOCTOR X111
So you can get them um at Walgreen’s.

PATIENT X111
Walgreen’s right.

DOCTOR X111
Walgreen’s or CVS and they cost from what I hear generally $20-$25 for one that works fine.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
If you don't want to buy one you can go into any CVS and they have them that you can check your blood pressure there but that means you have to be going to the CVS all the time.

PATIENT X111
Alright.

DOCTOR X111
Um but uh from what people that have got them have told me they cost about $20-$25.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
Um the other thing uh is it an issue getting here um, being from xxx xxx.  Is that why you don't come often?

PATIENT X111
xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X111
xxx xxx.

PATIENT X111
Yeah I mean it takes me at least an hour, especially at this time, there's rush hour.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah.  No I understand.  The thing is with the stuff you're on, with the medications you're on and the medical issues you have we'd really like to be seeing you every three months or so.

PATIENT X111
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X111
Um if that's not possible uh we need you to get up here every three months, uh there is the xxx xxx Clinic.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
I just asked my attending about it and he said that if you get the number for them, I can't get you an appointment there or anything but um they can give you the number.  I'm not saying, we'd love to still treat you here, you know I'd love to have you come here every three months.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
But if that's not possible I'd much rather have you seen every three months than once every 15 months and your medications run out and you're not taking your medications for three months and.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
You know we're coming in and we're trying to chase our tail with everything else.  If it's going to be easier for you to get into that clinic um, for your own good I think its better that.

PATIENT X111
Yeah it only takes me about 15-20 minutes to get there.  I'm usually in and out of there anyway.

DOCTOR X111
But it's up to you.  Like I say.

PATIENT X111
I got the numbers at home.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  

PATIENT X111
I got them in my.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  I'd keep all your appointments here until you make an appointment there cause like I said we can't make an appointment there.

PATIENT X111
I know they got doctors here, you know they could schedule me or whatever and I could get that to work and they'd put that in my files so you know.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah.  But you really should be seeing someone every three months or so.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
Cause you're on, as you know you're on a bunch of medications.

PATIENT X111
Right, right.

DOCTOR X111
And we need to make sure we have you on the right doses that we don't have you on too much medication or too little.  Um seeing you every 15 months it's only going to hurt you.

PATIENT X111
Right, right.

DOCTOR X111
Um and while we'd love to see you here, I'd much rather you actually see someone regularly.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
So it may be an option for you.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
Um but if you don't mind we'll check the labs today and I'll give you a call later in the week and let you know uh about the Synthroid.

PATIENT X111
Hmm.

DOCTOR X111
I'll put through for the other medications okay.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.  So I got to go back down and get the blood tests?

DOCTOR X111
Yeah.  Yeah sorry.

PATIENT X111
That's alright, that's what happens I guess.

DOCTOR X111
Um yeah just get it done today because you said you can't make it later in the week right?

PATIENT X111
No it's just too hard.  I mean I'm taking off of work now but that's cause I got your appointment.

DOCTOR X111
When do you work, what shift do you work?

PATIENT X111
I work the day shift.

DOCTOR X111
Day shift.

PATIENT X111
I work from 7 to 3.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
7 to 3:30 yeah.

DOCTOR X111
If you can make it to the xxx xxx Clinic this week sometime that would be fine too but I want to know whether we need to restart your thyroid medication and I'd like to let you know this week.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
So it's up to you.

PATIENT X111
I can stop there afterwards because I've already eaten.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah okay.  Yeah if you can get it done today that's fine too.

PATIENT X111
As long as they can do it now, I'll go downstairs and they're quick.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  Any other questions or anything?

PATIENT X111
No, no.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.  As far as the reflux that you're saying you're having.  I think if you get restarted on the omeprazole that'll help.  That's why we had you on it.

PATIENT X111
Yeah.

DOCTOR X111
For the reflux.  So probably stopping that is what made the reflux get worse.

PATIENT X111
Huh it just happens you know what I mean.  @@@.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah.

PATIENT X111
Just thought it was because of the food I was eating.

DOCTOR X111
Yeah and there are things that make it worse and I'm sure you get told this, you know anything spicy.

PATIENT X111
Oh yeah.  I knew that or coffee.  I always do coffee in the morning.

DOCTOR X111
Coffee, alcohol.

PATIENT X111
Oh if I do that.

DOCTOR X111
Smoking makes it worse.

PATIENT X111
Oh I don't smoke anymore.

DOCTOR X111
So those are just things to watch out for.

PATIENT X111
Right but I try to take it easy you know.  I just take some Tums or something.  

DOCTOR X111
Yeah don't take too many though.

PATIENT X111
No, hopefully.

DOCTOR X111
You can actually run into a problem eating too many of those.

PATIENT X111
Right.

DOCTOR X111
Good seeing you.

PATIENT X111
Okay.

DOCTOR X111
I'll give you a call.

PATIENT X111
@@@.

DOCTOR X111
You give them to them when you sign out, they'll make an appointment for you.  Keep the appointments until; if you're going to switch to the xxx xxx Clinic keep these until you actually get an appointment there.  There's sometimes a waiting list so you can keep seeing us until they get you in.

PATIENT X111
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X111
Okay.

PATIENT X111
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X111
Alright.

PATIENT X111
@@@.  Thank you now.

DOCTOR X111
Okay and I'll give you a call at the end of the week.

PATIENT X111
Okay.

DOCTOR X111
I'll see you again.

PATIENT X111
Alright.

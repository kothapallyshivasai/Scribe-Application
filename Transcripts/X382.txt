PATIENT X382
I go but it's you know, it's like its inadequate and I go four, five, six times a day.

DOCTOR X382
Okay maybe you're not completely going those times that you do go.

PATIENT X382
I mean.

DOCTOR X382
Have you been.  I mean it might be because.

PATIENT X382

DOCTOR OUT:  55:09    DOCTOR IN:  57:33

DOCTOR X382
Okay.  I think we're gonna, it looks like it might be like you're not completely going is my, what the issue is.  I think we need to bulk up your stool a little bit more.  It could still be from the morphine.  It might be just presenting differently in you, you know.

PATIENT X382
Okay.

DOCTOR X382
Um I'm gonna give you some fiber to take okay.  Why don't you take it for the next uh whatever month or so and see if that helps with your stool okay.  I'll mail it to you okay.

PATIENT X382
Okay.

DOCTOR X382
See if that works.  Alright and then if we have to go and do a colonoscopy then we'll do that but let's see if we can figure out what it is.  I mean it's like a motility problem or whatever it is okay.

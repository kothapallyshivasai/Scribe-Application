DOCTOR X129

SECOND PERSON X129

DOCTOR X129

SECOND PERSON X129
Is there anything that you need?

PATIENT X129
No.

SECOND PERSON X129
@@@.

DOCTOR X129
Okay, okay.  So let's see.

SECOND PERSON X129
Don't you think we were well-organized this time?

DOCTOR X129
Okay let's see.  Okay now.

SECOND PERSON X129
Now you can handle the rest of it.  I do the accounting.

DOCTOR X129
And you're back on dialysis?

PATIENT X129
Pardon me?

DOCTOR X129
You're back on dialysis?

PATIENT X129
Uh yes.  Uh Wednesday and Saturday, two times a week.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
He's having some problems with the Saturday one.  He's always sick on Sunday and so they cut him back this last Saturday right?

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
And he seemed to be a little better.  

DOCTOR X129
@@@ therapy comes to the house a couple of times a week.

PATIENT X129
I do therapy at home @@@.

DOCTOR X129
Do you go @@@.

PATIENT X129
I go to xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.  How many times a week?

PATIENT X129
Uh twice a week.

SECOND PERSON X129
Two to three times I think it comes out.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.  Well let's see.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, nothing like that?

PATIENT X129
No.

DOCTOR X129
Good.  Um now the last time you saw the urologist, you did a urine test which came back positive.  He had some; did they ever give you antibiotics for that?

PATIENT X129
Uh, you know what.

SECOND PERSON X129
We, she sent the report.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
Because @@@ because the last time that he was in the hospital.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
They said he is carrying a chronic bacteria.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
In his bladder.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
And that it cannot be treated by oral antibiotics.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
And uh he's just going to have to live with it kind of and that occasionally it will cause symptoms.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
If the symptoms are not, if they're not tolerable I don't know, uh then he would, PATIENT would go have to go into the hospital and have an IV antibiotic and he did have a temp the night before we came out here.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
And also he was kind of @@@ too I think that night.  He had chills or something, @@@.  But uh then he seemed to get over it.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.  You don't have a Foley catheter do you?

PATIENT X129
Yeah they did one the last time uh-huh.  I don't know if I still have @@@.

SECOND PERSON X129
No a Foley catheter.  No, no.

PATIENT X129
Oh, got it.

SECOND PERSON X129
No.

PATIENT X129
That's something different.

DOCTOR X129
When you do urinate, there is no pain, no burning with urination?

PATIENT X129
No.

DOCTOR X129
Right okay well again that's the reason why @@@ can have these symptoms and you know @@@.  And blood pressures at home, how have they been?  Blood pressures he takes at home?

PATIENT X129
Uh I haven't taken it and I don't know why.  Yeah you know it's controlled and I guess that's why I got off of you know taking it every day at home.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.  That's fine.

SECOND PERSON X129
@@@ I suppose we should do that.  We used to do that all the time.

PATIENT X129
Yeah @@@.

SECOND PERSON X129
Well @@@.  It kind of got dropped by the way side.

DOCTOR X129
How about your blood sugars?

PATIENT X129
Uh they run crazy you know.  Usually in the morning they can be anywhere from you know 121 to you know 169 sometimes and uh then at afternoon it'll generally be in the 200s with some exceptions it'll be lower than that but most times in the afternoons are the low 200s.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.  Do you have a log?

PATIENT X129
Yep.  I didn't bring it.

DOCTOR X129
No problem.  So just because, @@@.

SECOND PERSON X129
And uh his sugars in the evening sometimes drop way down.  They sometimes have you like 68 or 70 at night time so then he doesn't take any insulin.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.  Okay.  So um that's not as good.  Low sugars are not good so um so if it's something that's consistent you might want to talk to the primary care doctor so that the large dose of Aspart might be lowered.  You can lower that.

PATIENT X129
Okay.

DOCTOR X129
To prevent you from, you said it's normally lower than normal is that right?

SECOND PERSON X129
Right.

DOCTOR X129
His blood sugar is normally lower.

SECOND PERSON X129
It's kind of normal in the morning and then @@@.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
And so then it kind of peaks at noon.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
And then sometimes, this isn't always, but if he ever goes into low blood sugar it's in the afternoon.

DOCTOR X129
The afternoon.

SECOND PERSON X129
And it usually is um kind of normal-ish in the afternoon but once in a while.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.

PATIENT X129
It's normal.

SECOND PERSON X129
Yeah so this, @@@ his primary care doctor and then he gives us insulin.  When PATIENT goes to Physical Therapy a lot of times I'll run the log book up to either his doctor or the diabetes advisor.

DOCTOR X129
Oh good.

SECOND PERSON X129
And she does check it.

DOCTOR X129
Okay good.

SECOND PERSON X129
NAME.

DOCTOR X129
Good okay.  Okay.  Let's see.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X129
His diabetes doctor said he was brittle.

DOCTOR X129
Yeah, yes.  Brittle means @@@ he's definitely brittle.  @@@ but it requires exactly what you're doing testing and doing your logs every day so we can see the inconsistencies and then adjust it and @@@.

PATIENT X129
Okay.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.  @@@ uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
@@@ at Dialysis they want him to take, the dietician at Dialysis and his doctor have recommended that he drink @@@, are you familiar with @@@.

DOCTOR X129
@@@?

SECOND PERSON X129
It's a drink um you know and not an energy drink but a drink that helps you with nutrition and it's, I guess it's very high in fat and sugar but it's also high in protein.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
@@@.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
You know but I haven't always agreed with it so um.  He takes that a couple days and that sends his sugar up.

DOCTOR X129
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X129
Because it has tons of sugar in it.

DOCTOR X129
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X129
I just don't get it.  They said you need more when you're on dialysis.

DOCTOR X129
@@@ he is also diabetic so I'm sure there's something else they have @@@.

SECOND PERSON X129
Now they have, you know they knew about the diabetes.  They knew everything and they said you know what we're going to tell you is actually the opposite of what you've been hearing about the diabetes and I didn't always agree with them so.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
But I understand they reformulated it at the end of this month so maybe it'll @@@.

DOCTOR X129
Yeah, okay.  How's your COPD?

PATIENT X129
How do I feel?

DOCTOR X129
Yeah the breathing?

PATIENT X129
Oh fine, fine.

DOCTOR X129
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X129
No.

DOCTOR X129
And your cardiologist said that you need to take aspirin or Plavix?

PATIENT X129
Uh no because I take the Coumadin.

DOCTOR X129
And you have @@@.

PATIENT X129
Yeah.

DOCTOR X129
Okay and then let's see.  Also did we talk about starting a medication called lisinopril or any medicine that ends with a pril?

SECOND PERSON X129
I don't know.

DOCTOR X129
A medication called lisinopril or.

PATIENT X129
What's that for?

DOCTOR X129
It's for the heart.  I think I mentioned it the last time.

SECOND PERSON X129
I don't remember because, I don't remember that do you?  Um is it something he was on or did?

DOCTOR X129
No he'd never been on it, I just don't know why he'd never been on this um.  @@@.  Does he have heart disease?  @@@.  It helps the heart.

SECOND PERSON X129
Well you know.

PATIENT X129
What's the other uh medication.

SECOND PERSON X129
You take the amiodarone.

PATIENT X129
No.

SECOND PERSON X129
@@@  You take @@@ and you take carvedilol.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
And the folic acid @@@.

DOCTOR X129

SECOND PERSON X129
Like Coreg.

PATIENT X129
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X129
Okay that's the same as carvedilol

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X129
Oh it is oh okay.

SECOND PERSON X129
Yeah I don't know.

PATIENT X129

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
Um DOCTOR is his cardiologist.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
And he's the one you know you told me to get an appointment.

DOCTOR X129
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X129
@@@.  He couldn't make any other changes to his and they used to say that PATIENT had congestive heart failure.

DOCTOR X129
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X129
But that seems to have kind of dropped out of the picture, I don't know.  DOCTOR said his heart was the best thing about him the other day.  Maybe that's small praise I don't know.

DOCTOR X129
Yes, yes.

SECOND PERSON X129
But uh.

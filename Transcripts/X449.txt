PATIENT X449
With a cold yeah, over.

DOCTOR X449
When did that start?

PATIENT X449
A couple days ago.

DOCTOR X449
Couple days ago.  Just a runny nose or?

PATIENT X449

DOCTOR X449
@@@.

PATIENT X449
I feel a little bit under the weather.

DOCTOR X449
Any fevers?

PATIENT X449
Yeah Sunday night I had a little fever.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
But it was not too bad.

DOCTOR X449
Is it getting better or worse?

PATIENT X449
It's getting to be a little better.

DOCTOR X449
Starting to get better alright.  It's probably like a virus.

PATIENT X449
Yeah my son, my son had it.  Right then and there I said I picked that cold from you dude.

DOCTOR X449
(Laughter) Any sore throat or anything like that?

PATIENT X449
It was sore for about a day or so.

DOCTOR X449
Now that's gone?  Any cough?

PATIENT X449
Not really coughing.  Sneezing and a lot of runny nose, man.

DOCTOR X449
I think it sounds like you're on the mend.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Hopefully you've turned the corner.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Sometimes these things can stick around for a week or two.  But you said it sounds like you're getting better.

PATIENT X449
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X449
Uh let's see, how are you doing otherwise.  Any chest pain, shortness of breath anything like that?

PATIENT X449
Uh not really chest pain.  A little, I mean not shortness of breath, I got a little chest pain but I think that comes from being congested, runny nose.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah when did you have those chest pains?

PATIENT X449
The last couple days.

DOCTOR X449
Last couple days.

PATIENT X449
Yeah but you know.

DOCTOR X449
Okay do you think that anything, tell me a little more about that.

PATIENT X449
Hmm.  I think it's, I don't know it's just like uncomfortable.  Like I lay on this side then if I lay on the other side its better.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
It could be maybe, I don't know maybe from the cold, I don't know.

DOCTOR X449
If you're walking around do you get the chest pain?

PATIENT X449
No.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.  When it comes on does it seem like a discomfort?  Is it like a pressing sensation?

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Or a burning pain?

PATIENT X449
Like a burning pain then it goes away.

DOCTOR X449
How long will it last for?

PATIENT X449
A split second and then I may not have it no more for about two, three hours you know.

DOCTOR X449
And you said a split second.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Uh and so it won't last long?  It just goes off on its own.  Do you have to rest when that happens?

PATIENT X449
No it just, you know it's uncomfortable.

DOCTOR X449
Just kind of comes on.  Is it anything like when you had your heart attack?

PATIENT X449
No, that's the, you know my wife and I talked about it.  I said if it is I'll let you know you know.

DOCTOR X449
Any dizziness when you get that pain?

PATIENT X449
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X449
Any nausea when you get this pain?

PATIENT X449
No.

DOCTOR X449
Does it feel like the heart's racing at all?

PATIENT X449
No.

DOCTOR X449
Did you have any of those when you had your heart attack?

PATIENT X449
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.

PATIENT X449
You know I'd say I'm familiar with the symptoms.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
I know.  If it get to that point you know I could.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah we got to keep an eye on it okay.

PATIENT X449
You know say something.

DOCTOR X449
And you don't feel like you've had to take nitroglycerin?

PATIENT X449
No I haven't taken it you know.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.  When was the last time you took nitroglycerin?

PATIENT X449
Oh man it's been a while.

DOCTOR X449
It has been.

PATIENT X449
I just got a new bottle cause the other one was so old.

DOCTOR X449
Right.

PATIENT X449
So they told me they were gonna replace it.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah you said you were having a stress test.

PATIENT X449
Right.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.  Then if you need it you should have it.

PATIENT X449
I think I got it about a month ago.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.  @@@.  Tell me about your diabetes now.  Are you taking medications?

PATIENT X449
Yeah but it seems like its still running.

DOCTOR X449
The last time we saw you, that was in October.  At that time the reason your sugars were running high is you weren't taking the medication.  So we said let's take your medications and see what that does.  Uh it looks like their still running high.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.  I takes it and still ain't right.  120 sometime and 130, 140, 160 even and I don't know what I'm doing.

DOCTOR X449
That's in the morning?

PATIENT X449
It was bad today cause I didn't take it this morning.  I didn't eat anything cause I didn't have a appetite really.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
And you know she said well you should eat something and I said no I'm okay but then when she took it out there it was 168 and I couldn't understand it.  

DOCTOR X449
And that's without having anything to eat.

PATIENT X449
I didn't eat anything.

DOCTOR X449
And the other thing is you got that lab recently, a couple days ago?

PATIENT X449
Yeah, I said I would make sure I come in here so we can get that done before.

DOCTOR X449
And that one tells us that it's been out of control for a long time now, like for three months, probably since I saw you.  Cause that's what it's saying with the Glargine.

PATIENT X449
Than what, I wanted to make sure I get that before I come back in here.

DOCTOR X449
So let's see.

PATIENT X449
So I came in Monday.

DOCTOR X449
So that's what brings up the next question, is what can we do at this point.  There's two options okay.  There's a third medication we can add on that the VA has but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and the other one is insulin, we might have to start at some point with that.  Cause with your heart history, it will be important for us to get our diabetes under control.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
Uh what you.

DOCTOR X449
Which one do I think?

PATIENT X449
I don't want the insulin.

DOCTOR X449
I'll talk to DOCTOR you don't want.

PATIENT X449
No I don't want insulin.  I mean let's see, let's try it a month.  You know and I take strict control of it.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
I will take, you know I take my medication; I make sure I take it on time and let's see what happens.  One month and then we go from there.

DOCTOR X449
You want uh.

PATIENT X449
Just give it a little time and see if it works and.

DOCTOR X449
But you said you've been taking your medications regularly.

PATIENT X449
I been taking it you know.

DOCTOR X449
So that be a good reflection of where we are.  Let me talk to, I actually don't see it on the list here.  Let me see if the VA offers it, this third medication.

PATIENT X449
What is it?

DOCTOR X449
Uh it's Actos, pioglitazone um but I mean I'll talk to him and we'll come up with a plan.

PATIENT X449
And then see even if I have, you know sometime like I have to take the metformin twice a day.

DOCTOR X449
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X449
A lot of time, I do forget at night but I make sure I take it every day.

DOCTOR X449
You do take it every day.

PATIENT X449
Every morning I takes it.  Well a couple times at night I forget before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X449
So that's not every day.

PATIENT X449
That's not every day.  I don't forget every day but I do forget at times.

DOCTOR X449
Right.

PATIENT X449
But the one in the morning I been taking every day.

DOCTOR X449
And I'm looking at your weight, your weight let's see, this all has affects on it um so that's something else we can work on, try to get you to lose some weight okay.  Um you probably have your boots on and stuff like that.

PATIENT X449
Boots here because but you know I realize you know it's still too much level but I seen 250 up there and yes that's too much.

DOCTOR X449
And exercise is gonna help control your diabetes also okay.  So I'll probably take the problems with your heart disease @@@.

PATIENT X449
Yeah maybe like before you know it got cool it was kind of, the weight was, I don't know I was fishing and moving around.

DOCTOR X449
You were doing a lot.

PATIENT X449
And I was doing more things than I'm doing now you know.

DOCTOR X449
Alright.  And your breathing is okay otherwise.

PATIENT X449
No I'm fine.

DOCTOR X449
Alright. Let's take a look and see everything.

PATIENT X449
And I'd like a suggestion like I say.

DOCTOR X449
Right.

PATIENT X449
My shirt off?

DOCTOR X449
Yeah please.  Let me see if we checked your cholesterol.  

PATIENT X449
The blood pressure's been fine.

DOCTOR X449
The blood pressure today was just.

PATIENT X449
It's been hanging in there real fine but I can't understand what's you said there.

DOCTOR X449
Give me a second.  How is, what's your diet?

PATIENT X449
Uh my wife have me eating like a pigeon sometimes.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.  So she's taking control of that?

PATIENT X449
Yeah man, vegetables I mean you know.  She say I still don't eat as much as I should but you know.

DOCTOR X449
So she does that.

PATIENT X449
Yeah man.

DOCTOR X449
She's watching out for you huh.

PATIENT X449
Sometimes I tease her.

DOCTOR X449
(Laughter)  That's a good thing for you.

PATIENT X449
Yeah she been making those juices and shakes and all kinds of things.

DOCTOR X449
Can you tell me how often do you get this chest pain?

PATIENT X449
Hmm a couple times a day.

DOCTOR X449
Couple times a day.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
And that's for how long, how many months?

PATIENT X449
Not months.  It's like the last few days or something.  I thought maybe, I figured maybe I was congested or something.  I really don't know.  But like I said it wasn't to the point you know where I was really, really concerned about it.

DOCTOR X449
Right.

PATIENT X449
But it was there.

DOCTOR X449
It was there.  Okay.  Any belly pain?

PATIENT X449
No.

DOCTOR X449
Blood in the urine, you going to the bathroom okay?

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Urinating okay though?

PATIENT X449
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X449
Any swelling?

PATIENT X449
No.

DOCTOR X449
Alright.  Let's see I'll be right back in a second.

PATIENT X449
Okay.  You gonna see about that medication and what we gonna do about that.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
Going to see about the sugar?

DOCTOR X449
Yeah that's what I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR about.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
We'll come up with a plan for you okay.

PATIENT X449
Alright.

DOCTOR X449
And you know part of it does, we may recommend insulin looking at the um.

PATIENT X449
May recommend.

DOCTOR X449
We might okay and if that's the case then we'll have someone teach you more about that.

PATIENT X449
Alright.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.  But I'm going to talk to her.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  40:46  DOCTOR IN:  48:27)

DOCTOR X449
Alright.  Let's see.  So we talked about it and um a couple things came up.  So we were looking at your medications.  If you think insulin and we were gonna add one more thing than @@@.  

PATIENT X449
@@@.

DOCTOR X449
Um you know with your heart history I guess that it's absolutely @@@ to get your diabetes under control cause otherwise we're just putting you at risk of having another heart attack.  Cause those stents that you have um, because they keep the vessels open but they're also at risk of closing up if we don't control your other illnesses.   Does that make sense?  Um because I was looking through here and some of these medications haven't been filled since December it says.  @@@.

PATIENT X449
I been taking them, that's the old ones.  I was just trying to get them all out the way @@@.

DOCTOR X449
@@@ okay.

PATIENT X449
Now they just about used up.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
And that's what I wanted to do instead of because that's a waste of med, you know that.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.  So I believe you I mean @@@.

PATIENT X449
I had a few bottles of each one of those things and I just started taking them instead of, I don't like to throw away stuff like that.

DOCTOR X449
No problem.  So would be okay then, I think we should start the insulin.

PATIENT X449
Now how would I take it?

DOCTOR X449
So someone would teach you how to do it.  Usually what it is, you go underneath the skin.  They'll put you, you have to get a small injection um but it's not going to be too much different than what you're doing when you check your sugars right.

PATIENT X449
Alright.

DOCTOR X449
So you break the skin and then it's just going to be under the skin and you give yourself an injection.

PATIENT X449
And how much would I have to take?

DOCTOR X449
So we're gonna start with 10 units okay and what we're going to have you do is come in three weeks.  Just check it every day, continue to do what you're doing, check it every day and uh keep an eye on what kind of affect it's having on your sugars cause if it's dropping too low then we may have to back off okay.  We're gonna start on uh.

PATIENT X449
And how often do you want me to take the sugar each day then?

DOCTOR X449
Once a day, still do it once a day.

PATIENT X449
Once a day.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.

PATIENT X449
And when do I take the insulin?  In the morning or?

DOCTOR X449
So usually they do it at night but there's no particular reason for that.  It sounds like for you, you remember your meds mostly in the mornings.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
So let's do it in the morning.  Does that sound fair?

PATIENT X449
I'd take one shot in the morning and that's it.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah and that's it.

PATIENT X449
Then would I check the sugar at night or?

DOCTOR X449
Check it before to make sure it's gonna be.  This insulin that we're gonna start you off on is going to be one that will act for 24 hours okay.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
Uh you may have been in the hospital before where they have to give you a shot every six hours or so, that's not the same insulin that we're going to be using.  So you have to check it in the morning before you give it to make sure your sugar is not too low to get the insulin.

PATIENT X449
What should the sugar be?  Like at least before I'd take it?

DOCTOR X449
So if it's below 90.

PATIENT X449
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X449
I wouldn't take it.

PATIENT X449
Take it.  If it below 90 don't take it.

DOCTOR X449
Don't take it and then.

PATIENT X449
Continue the other medications?

DOCTOR X449
Continue all the other medications.  So that's what we, what I want to do is see how you do down the line or maybe start taking you off the other meds.  If you start taking the insulin @@@ and we'll maybe take off the glyburide.

PATIENT X449
Well I mean what about taking off the insulin if it's working?

DOCTOR X449
Well that's uh.

PATIENT X449
In three weeks, if we got it under control with adding the insulin.

DOCTOR X449
Well that means, that's what we'd need every day to try and keep you under control.  @@@.  Okay.  Now if you start losing weight and that sort of thing and your sugars improve with that, we may be able to back off of the insulin by the end of the road.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.  I know you're worried about it and I know it's hard to accept it but sometimes when you have to give yourself a shot and that sort of thing but really the most important thing is gonna be your heart and that's what we're trying to look after.  Does that make sense?  Cause you've already proven to yourself the fact that your vessels are @@@ that they're going to be affected by the cholesterol and the @@@.  Now the cholesterol it seems like we've gotten back under control now we'll take care of the diabetes.  Your blood pressure is doing better so that's the one last thing @@@.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.  And then the.

PATIENT X449
I know how to use the insulin.

DOCTOR X449
You do?

PATIENT X449
Yeah.  What do I get, they gonna give me the injections you know everything I need I can pick them up from the Pharmacy or they gonna mail them?

DOCTOR X449
Uh why don't we have you pick it up so that someone can show you exactly how to use it.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.

PATIENT X449
And pick up the rest of the medication or you gonna mail that?

DOCTOR X449
Uh it's up to you; I'll put the orders in for them.  Now the albuterol I noticed you do have refills on them.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
11 refills on that and you take your Plavix every day?

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Okay.  So you have to have all your medications enough to last you through June.

PATIENT X449
Is it okay to take the Levitra with insulin?

DOCTOR X449
Yeah so the Levitra it's actually okay to take with insulin uh but the concern and the reason they've actually taken it off their list is uh because of the @@@.

PATIENT X449
I know not to mix the two.

DOCTOR X449
Okay, I'll get it.  But yeah I think we had that discussion the last time you came in. 

PATIENT X449
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X449
I thought it was okay but actually they @@@.  I thought it would okay because we had that discussion.

PATIENT X449
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X449
But they uh, the VA oh the bosses of the VA still @@@.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
So actually I had ordered it.  So if you have some that you want to use then just make sure you don't, I mean if you're having any chest pains or anything then don't use it.

PATIENT X449
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X449
Now the chest pain, like you said it doesn't sound like it's from your heart, it sounds like something else.  Give me just a sec, do you feel that at all when I press there?

PATIENT X449
I don't get no pain.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.  But the fact that it's only less than a second.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
It doesn't sound like something to worry about.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
If there is at any point that changes then don't wait till your next appointment, come in right away.

PATIENT X449
Alright.  I just decided it wasn't really severe so I got to go Wednesday anyway to go back to the Emergency Room so.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.  I think that's fair.  I think at this point but if like if it starts lasting more than a minute, couple minutes.

PATIENT X449
Right.

DOCTOR X449
Then you have to come in okay.  Alright.  And then the other thing when we start insulin you have to make sure, the same with your other @@@ is a consistent diet.  You're having the same number of meals every day that kind of thing.

PATIENT X449
Same number of meals.

DOCTOR X449
Yes.

PATIENT X449
Well you know that's something I kind of get in the habit of doing that because see like today I just didn't have no appetite, I didn't eat.

DOCTOR X449
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X449
So you know.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah just so, cause we also want you to, so we want you to avoid getting high but we also want you avoid getting too low okay.  That's not a problem with your sugars getting too low.  Alright.  You're all set okay.  So I'm gonna have you come back for two things in three weeks just to see how your sugars are doing.
 
PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
If you can, at that time, also bring the log if you can try to record what you were getting at home.

PATIENT X449
Fasting readings, I can set this meter.

DOCTOR X449
Set the meter okay.

PATIENT X449
Yeah.

DOCTOR X449
Then bring that with you then.

PATIENT X449
I got plenty of scripts though.

DOCTOR X449
You did.

PATIENT X449
I mean they there, I mean I can pick them up?

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.

PATIENT X449
That's what.

DOCTOR X449
Yeah.  No but I want you to bring in the readings so we can see what your getting.

PATIENT X449
Okay.

DOCTOR X449
And then we'll have you just come back and see me in 2-3 months.

PATIENT X449
Okay three weeks.

DOCTOR X449
Stop up here and they'll check your sugar and then we can make some injections they will inform me and @@@.

PATIENT X449
Okay so when I leave they give me an appointment in three weeks to come back.

DOCTOR X449
Yes.

PATIENT X449
Check in at the desk.

DOCTOR X449
Right.  Okay.

PATIENT X449

DOCTOR X449

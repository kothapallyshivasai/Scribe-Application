PATIENT X440
Yes I think I do remember that.

DOCTOR X440

PATIENT X440

DOCTOR X440
Did you remember that or?

PATIENT X440

DOCTOR X440
But you forgot to come back or what happened?

PATIENT X440

DOCTOR X440
Yeah.

PATIENT X440
I forget everything.

DOCTOR X440
Okay.  Yeah it's important.  We need to get this um you know, is your chest pain getting worse or?

PATIENT X440
Well you know I need something like Zantac or something like could you order me something like that?

DOCTOR X440
Yeah you have some ranitidine.

PATIENT X440
But it's not something that's working.

DOCTOR X440
Not working.

PATIENT X440
No.

DOCTOR X440
Well what kind of pain are you feeling?

PATIENT X440
Sharp.  And every now and then it's like a sharp pain and everything.

DOCTOR X440
Sharp pain.

PATIENT X440
Every now and then.

DOCTOR X440
Okay and when do you get that?  When you're walking or is it at rest?

PATIENT X440
Yes.

DOCTOR X440
And is that the pain you were telling the cardiologist or no?

PATIENT X440
Yeah and sometimes when I walk in heavy @@@, something like that, it goes beat, beat, beat.

DOCTOR X440
Okay, @@@.  Okay then how far can you walk?  You said half a block before you get that chest pain.

PATIENT X440
Yeah.

DOCTOR X440
Is that the same or just?

PATIENT X440
Yeah about the same.

DOCTOR X440
About the same okay.

PATIENT X440
You think you could give me something for gas?

DOCTOR X440
Yeah I can give you something for gas but we need to make sure it's not your heart.

PATIENT X440
Yeah well I need something for gas.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah.  Do you think it's because the belching makes that chest pain better.

PATIENT X440
Not really.

DOCTOR X440
Okay um and then how about, um do you feel short of breath when it happens?

PATIENT X440
Yeah I have to stop.

DOCTOR X440
You need to stop.

PATIENT X440
Yeah.

DOCTOR X440
And then it gets better?

PATIENT X440
Yes when I stop.

DOCTOR X440
Have you tried the nitroglycerin or no?

PATIENT X440
No that's one that I just.

DOCTOR X440
You've never tried taking it whenever you get the chest pain?

PATIENT X440
No.

DOCTOR X440
So you're able to walk about half a block before you get this sharp chest pain.

PATIENT X440
Yeah.

DOCTOR X440
And where is it located?

PATIENT X440
Right up in here.

DOCTOR X440
Right up in there.

PATIENT X440

DOCTOR X440
And it's sharp, it's not dull?

PATIENT X440

DOCTOR X440
Okay so you feel like your heart's beating really fast.

PATIENT X440
Yeah.

DOCTOR X440
Okay.  Do you ever feel this chest pain when you're just sitting here?

PATIENT X440
No.

DOCTOR X440
No.  How about do you feel nausea and want to vomit or feel like you're sweaty or anything like that?

PATIENT X440
Well sometimes I sweat a lot.

DOCTOR X440
Okay.

PATIENT X440
When @@@.

DOCTOR X440
Okay.  And then um have you noticed problems laying flat in bed or notice any swelling in your legs or anything like that?

PATIENT X440
Well see this leg here, they was gonna operate on it.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah.

PATIENT X440
And it's the flow is slowing up right here.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah.  Okay.  How long has that been swollen?  For a while or?

PATIENT X440
Oh yes, yes.

DOCTOR X440

DOCTOR X440
Okay.  Alright and then how about do you ever wake up at night feeling like you can't breathe or anything?  No.

PATIENT X440
It isn't no, it's every now and then, @@@.

DOCTOR X440
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X440
You know it's not @@@.

DOCTOR X440
Okay.  Um alright do you ever feel like, how many pillows do you sleep on, one or two or three or?

PATIENT X440
Actually one and a half.

DOCTOR X440
One and a half.  Has that changed or about the same?

PATIENT X440
About the same.

DOCTOR X440
Okay.

PATIENT X440
Could you tell me when or how they gonna operate on me?

DOCTOR X440
Um let's see.  Did you see the doctor, the foot doctor I mean the orthopedist?  Oh you mean the cardiologist?

PATIENT X440
Yeah.

DOCTOR X440
They wanted you to come back last week or two weeks ago.

PATIENT X440
Yeah there was a storm that they.

DOCTOR X440
Oh that day yeah.

PATIENT X440
I didn't make it in because of that storm.

DOCTOR X440
So you were supposed to come back last Thursday it was January 4th.  Yeah you were supposed to come the 7th and you couldn't come.

PATIENT X440
I @@@ already.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah that's when they wanted you to come.

PATIENT X440
But uh could you tell me when they were going to operate on that, you know I want.

DOCTOR X440
Oh I think you should probably come back and see them.

PATIENT X440
Can I @@@ operate?

DOCTOR X440
Today.

PATIENT X440
Yes I want to get this over with.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah no I think it's an important thing cause we don't know what's going on with your chest pain because you have the heart disease.

PATIENT X440
I have a heart disease?

DOCTOR X440
Yeah your heart.  You know that you had a heart attack right?

PATIENT X440
Yeah in July.

DOCTOR X440
So that shows that you have like um some clogged arteries in your heart.

PATIENT X440
Yeah they said they could put some stents in there.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah they want to take a look at it you know.  Didn't you have stents put in?

PATIENT X440
Yes ma'am in uh.

DOCTOR X440
In 07 yeah.

PATIENT X440
Pardon me (patient takes a phone call).

DOCTOR X440
I think if we get you admitted today you'll be okay, if we admit you?  Because you shouldn't go around with these chest pains going on.  Can we admit you today?

PATIENT X440
Okay you can admit me today.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah let me talk about it.  Let's have you sit up here okay.  Um cause they wanted to admit you back the last time they saw you right?  But you had to handle some financial matters @@@.

PATIENT X440
Yeah.

DOCTOR X440
So I think since you've been having this chest pain, if it's been happening every day, it's pretty much every time you walk half a block right?

PATIENT X440
Yeah.

DOCTOR X440
And so does it occur all the time when you walk or just.

PATIENT X440
Every now and then now.

DOCTOR X440
Okay.

PATIENT X440
It's not, @@@ not as sharp.

DOCTOR X440
Not as sharp but it's been going.  You can sit right here.

PATIENT X440
Okay.

DOCTOR X440
I think it might be a good idea if we just go ahead and admit you, but I'll just go talk to someone to see if we can do that okay.  I might have to do an EKG just to see what's going on okay.

PATIENT X440
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X440
I think that'd be the best thing because they were worried about you last time and we need to put you on the right medication too okay.

PATIENT X440
Okay.

DOCTOR X440
Alright deep breath, okay another one.  Another one, good, breath in, good.  Okay can you lay back for me.  So you sleep on about one and a half pillows and that's been like that for a while?

PATIENT X440
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X440
@@@.  Do you smoke or drink or anything?

PATIENT X440
No I don't drink and I don't use dope but I smoke.

DOCTOR X440
You smoke.

PATIENT X440
@@@ but I.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah you should try stopping because that's not good especially since you have, since you had a heart attack.  I want to just look at your legs for the swelling, sorry.

PATIENT X440
Yeah.  Let me take this shoe off.

DOCTOR X440
Yeah.

PATIENT X440
I'll take this shoe off.

DOCTOR X440
It's pretty swollen in your feet.

PATIENT X440
Yeah this one here.

DOCTOR X440

PATIENT X440

DOCTOR X440
Alright sir.  Can I actually have you outside but it'll be a second.  Um we're trying to contact the cardiologist too okay.  So you are willing to get admitted though and I think it's a good idea to do that okay.

PATIENT X440

DOCTOR X440
Okay don't forget your @@@.

PATIENT X440

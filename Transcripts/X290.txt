DOCTOR X290 
PATIENT?  How you doing?

PATIENT X290
I'm okay.

DOCTOR X290
Just have a seat here, where ever it's most comfortable for you.  

PATIENT X290
Alright.

DOCTOR X290
So I went ahead and refilled some of your meds, I saw that you were out of refills.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
So I went ahead and refilled those.  Um are you having any problems?  Are you still having problems with the urination?

PATIENT X290
Yes.

DOCTOR X290
Still going on?

PATIENT X290
Yeah they gave me uh instead of this one, but it's not on here I don't think.  For today, is that's the oxybutynin?

DOCTOR X290
Oxybutynin yeah, it's on this one.

PATIENT X290
Yeah that's that little blue one I think.  If it is that little blue one from today from today yeah okay.  

DOCTOR X290
Uh and then also the doxazosin is for the prostate.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.  Yeah okay it may be working and may not I don't know.  I still get up in the nighttime but it seems like I'm lasting longer in the daytime.

DOCTOR X290
Oh good.  Which one's the new one, the oxybutynin?

PATIENT X290
It looks like oxybutynin.

DOCTOR X290
Alright.

PATIENT X290
Is that one the little blue, the little blue pill, uh it was started by the guy, the doctor downstairs, what's it used for?

DOCTOR X290
It's used for like bladder stuff.

PATIENT X290
That's it.

DOCTOR X290
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X290
But there was one I didn't agree with or wasn't going to use.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah finasteride.

PATIENT X290
Yeah so that one I'm not taking that at all.  I called them up and told them I'm not even you know.

DOCTOR X290
Sure.

PATIENT X290
So don't renew it.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Uh and you just saw the urologist back at the end of January, looks like everything is okay.

PATIENT X290
Yeah, so I go see him in six months.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Are you having any shortness of breath still?

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
Cause I think last time you were having some shortness of breath and you were using your wife's inhaler.

PATIENT X290
Yeah that's the, everyone I had that has that, where I start to wheeze and I can't catch my breath.  That hasn't happened since before Christmas.

DOCTOR X290
Oh okay good.

PATIENT X290
Around there, so that's pretty much gone now.  Uh what I did, I'm having some teeth problems.  I had a tooth pulled and a tooth filled and this was at about Christmas time so I didn't go to the dentist and I was taking aspirin every night.

DOCTOR X290
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X290
And I wound up with uh acid reflux.

DOCTOR X290
Uh, uh okay.

PATIENT X290
So I stopped the aspirin and then I'm taking, because of the tooth infection, hopefully that will go away, but the dentist gave me erythromycin.

DOCTOR X290
Oh okay.  How long were on that for?

PATIENT X290
Oh I'm just finishing up.

DOCTOR X290
Oh you're finishing okay.

PATIENT X290
Yeah I still have another tooth to get filled or I meant to get pulled, yeah, yeah on there so I'm going to have that one before I go again so for infection.  But since I got the erythromycin and I stopped the aspirin I haven't had any acid reflux since those.

DOCTOR X290
Have not had any more?

PATIENT X290
Right.

DOCTOR X290
Good.

PATIENT X290
But then I haven't had @@@ for a while either.  I'll go today because they're making vegetable soup.  As a matter of fact I was taking Tums and then I took that, what's that, omeprazole?

DOCTOR X290
Omeprazole?

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X290
Instead of taking it a nighttime I took it right after supper.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
That helped.  And then.

DOCTOR X290
Any other problems going on besides the teeth issue?

PATIENT X290
Okay uh I got a 25 pound barbell that I.

DOCTOR X290
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X290
That I go like this you know.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
And when I do the way up ones then every once in a while when I get around 15 of them, I got right here, but then it goes away and only when I do that.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Do you walk; do you ever walk for any distance?

PATIENT X290
I haven't been walking because the wife doesn't go to the pool anymore and so while she was in the pool I'd go take a walk.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
So.

DOCTOR X290
Have you been doing any other kind of exertion other than the weights?

PATIENT X290
Yeah I got uh I built a step for her.

DOCTOR X290
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X290
And I use it for stuff and so forth.  Two handles up here and it's about that far off the ground and I jump on and off of it.

DOCTOR X290
Do you ever get chest pain when you do that?

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
No.

PATIENT X290
Just pulse goes up to 120, no 100 about 110-120.

DOCTOR X290
Okay as long as you're exercising.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
And as long as you're not getting chest pain.  You know when you're doing this you're probably pulled a muscle yeah.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
If it was happening at any time you were exerting yourself then it might be a little bit more worrisome.

PATIENT X290
@@@.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.

PATIENT X290
Uh when I go downstairs once in a while my right knee bothers me but that's off and on, nothing no where it happens all the time, doesn't do that.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Your blood pressure is a little bit low today.  Does it normally run that low?

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
Like in the 90s.

PATIENT X290
Yeah I never have a 90.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  

PATIENT X290
It's always 100 something over 70 or something.

DOCTOR X290
Was it in the like 100s or one teens or 120s?

PATIENT X290
It's usually 110 or something like that.  Low, nothing high.

DOCTOR X290
I mean do you ever get lightheaded, dizzy, pass out?  Okay.  You know the lower the blood pressure the better as a rule.

PATIENT X290
Yeah but not too low.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah it can't get too low so that's why we try to make sure you don't get too low.  You're not getting lightheaded, dizzy; uh you know that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
I see you had some labs done at the end of January too.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
I don't know if your urologist went over them with you.

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
Basically your kidney function looks normal.  Uh your cholesterol.

PATIENT X290
Wait, wait a minute.

DOCTOR X290
Sure.

PATIENT X290
Okay.

DOCTOR X290
Uh the cholesterol looks good.  Uh the bad cholesterol is pretty low, its 94 and we like to see that below 100.

PATIENT X290
So it was 94, so it's below 100.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah exactly, so good.

PATIENT X290
What's the triglyceride?

DOCTOR X290
The triglycerides are 109 which is perfect.

PATIENT X290
Yeah that's getting down.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
So that niacin I guess is working.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah, yeah probably um and also the simvastatin is pretty good about doing that.

PATIENT X290
Yeah well I been taking the simvastatin for a long time.

DOCTOR X290
Your triglycerides are still a little bit of a problem.

PATIENT X290
So they, what are the triglycerides supposed to be?

DOCTOR X290
Uh you know we shoot for less than 150.

PATIENT X290
Well then I'm good.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah but even if you're a little bit above 150 we don't normally do too much.

PATIENT X290
So the medicine is working.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
And did the tests for that, pulmonary test, say anything?

DOCTOR X290
Uh let me see if they have already commented on it.

PATIENT X290
But that was done early.

DOCTOR X290
That was done the same day you were here right?  The same day you saw me?

PATIENT X290
I think so.  No it was after I saw you.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  It was normal, it was completely normal. 

PATIENT X290
Took the test.

DOCTOR X290
You know we use that specific test uh to see if people have like emphysema or asthma, something like that and you know, it was normal.

PATIENT X290
What about sugar?

DOCTOR X290
Your sugar was normal, it was 93.  We shoot for less than 100.  Well we shoot for less than 126 really.  

PATIENT X290
And I guess I still have my hernia.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.  Are you doing the MOVE Program too or?

PATIENT X290
I go there once a month.  I haven't been going to exercise cause I can't get the schedule in there.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
Can't leave my wife alone that's enough.  So far she fell eight times.

DOCTOR X290
Oh really.

PATIENT X290
Yeah, over a couple years.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.  I thought that we had switched the simvastatin to rosuvastatin.

PATIENT X290
No I didn't get that.  Well we talked about something different I think but I still got the, I didn't get anything new.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
The only thing I got new was the niacin.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah well I mean your cholesterol is perfect so I don't think we need to make any changes today.  So you're still taking the simvastatin right?

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
And that's got 0 refill, okay I'll refill that.  So you're taking the half a tablet of that right?

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
Okay and you're doing the niacin and you're just taking that once a day?

PATIENT X290
Yeah nighttime.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Okay yeah, so I think we'll stick with that.  Whatever seems to be working.  I don't know if it's your diet or the medication but something.

PATIENT X290
Well I lost weight.

DOCTOR X290
Oh good.

PATIENT X290
That's cause she's not eating and I'm not eating so then, until she gives me her half of the hamburger, things like that.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
Do want to finish this?

DOCTOR X290
Are you.

PATIENT X290
But she goes, she lost 40 pounds.

DOCTOR X290
Oh good so you guys are trying to lose weight?  Oh okay, okay.  I just want to make sure you're not dropping weight accidentally.  Alright.

PATIENT X290
I feel I got five more to go and then I'm gonna stop.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Yeah I don't think, it wouldn't hurt.  It'll help your cholesterol; probably help your blood pressure.  But your blood pressure's great now yeah.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
Are you having any pain with your hernia?

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.

PATIENT X290
As a matter of fact when I lay in the bed and try to pick my feet up I hold the stomach.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
And it's not red.  I know when it's gone.

DOCTOR X290
You're still not wanting surgery or anything.  You're okay with them?

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.

PATIENT X290
Cause nothing's happening.

DOCTOR X290
Alright.

PATIENT X290
No news good news.

DOCTOR X290
Alright and then they checked your, they checked the PSA again in November.

PATIENT X290
Yeah what's that?

DOCTOR X290
It was 0.7 so it was.

PATIENT X290
Didn't I have another PSA this last blood test?

DOCTOR X290
Yeah that was in November.

PATIENT X290
No I just had a blood test in January.

DOCTOR X290
Oh no, no we don't check it that often.

PATIENT X290
Oh.  So it wasn't on that list.

DOCTOR X290
No it was back in November.

PATIENT X290
Oh.

DOCTOR X290
It was 0.7.  The time before that was like 1.5 yeah.  So we looked at that back in May and it was 1.6 actually.

PATIENT X290
That went down then?

DOCTOR X290
It went down yeah.

PATIENT X290
Why would that be?

DOCTOR X290
Oh so it could be the urologists are kind of shrinking your prostate so you can kind of follow that number sometimes.  It'll tell you how big the prostate is getting so the bigger the prostate the bigger that number.

PATIENT X290
Oh.

DOCTOR X290
So it means your prostate's down.

PATIENT X290
So then I shouldn't be peeing as often.  

DOCTOR X290
Yeah I think that was the thought of the urologists.  If we can get your prostate shrunk down a little bit you wouldn't have as much symptoms.

PATIENT X290
And @@@.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah, yeah cause I know they had talked about that as a possibility.

PATIENT X290
Yeah if it ain't broke don't fix it.

DOCTOR X290
And your liver looks good.  We checked the liver enzymes and they look good.

PATIENT X290
That's because of the prostate medicine or because of the simvastatin?

DOCTOR X290
Uh probably just diet.

PATIENT X290
Oh.

DOCTOR X290
And stuff.

PATIENT X290
No okay.  But one of the medications affects the liver right?

DOCTOR X290
Yeah so sometimes the simvastatin can but it normally affects it in a bad way.

PATIENT X290
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X290
So it's not from the med, you're not having that kind of affect on it.  And you do sound like you're having less urinary episodes during the day.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
So maybe, see it's kind of a slow process.  It takes a while to build up in your system.  And when was your last colonoscopy?

PATIENT X290
Years back.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah 2002, so you're due this year.

PATIENT X290
Oh yeah?

DOCTOR X290
Yeah every ten years so if the last one was in 2002 so.

PATIENT X290
Oh.

DOCTOR X290
You know.

PATIENT X290
Can we get the colonoscopy and the endoscopic at the same time right?

DOCTOR X290
Uh.

PATIENT X290
This way and that way.

DOCTOR X290
No they usually just do the bottom.

PATIENT X290
No they both at that time on me.

DOCTOR X290
Why did they do both?

PATIENT X290
Because of GERD.

DOCTOR X290
The xxx's.

PATIENT X290
Because of the what do you call it?  The acid reflux.

DOCTOR X290
Oh okay.

PATIENT X290
Yeah he did both.  Doctor said I think the doctor was, oh something @@@ name too.  He said I could do both and I said okay.  He asked me if I ever had one, nope alright.  He says we got you up here so.  I guess it.

DOCTOR X290
And let's see and it was normal.  Okay.  So you know I don't think that they'll want to do one in the top again um.  I would be surprised.

PATIENT X290
It don't bother me cause I'm out.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah exactly.  Okay.  Are you still taking an aspirin a day?

PATIENT X290
Yeah the 80 mg.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.

PATIENT X290
That's in the morning.  I take the stool softener and I take a fish pill.

DOCTOR X290
The fish oil to.

PATIENT X290
Yeah and the aspirin and vitamin.

DOCTOR X290
Anybody in your family ever had colon cancer that you know of?

PATIENT X290
No they all have heart trouble.

DOCTOR X290
Heart trouble.

PATIENT X290
And diabetes.  My mother, my sister but her heart seems to be @@@.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Uh you don't have any prosthetic heart valves or anything like that?  I don't see you've had a heart valve replaced.  You don't have a pacemaker, no stents.  No.  You're not taking insulin.  You're not diabetic are you?

PATIENT X290
Right no.

DOCTOR X290
Alright.  

PATIENT X290
The gal in the MOVE, NAME.

DOCTOR X290
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X290
She took my uh body mass thing and says it's about 50, 54%.  I don't know much about it but it's kind of high.

DOCTOR X290
What was the 54%?

PATIENT X290
My body mass.  I think I'm over the limit.

DOCTOR X290
Your BMI?  It shouldn't be that high.

PATIENT X290
Well.  I wonder did she put it on the computer, would that be in there.  Have them put it in.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
Didn't write it down.  I wrote it down on the other, my weight thing that I take.  No 30 some, oh wait, they want it above 30 some percent, so I was okay, that 30 sounds I remember she said you can't have 0.  I says no, 0 would be skin and bones.  Alright 35.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.  So yeah the labs are great so we won't make any changes today um.  Do you ever check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  Just make sure if you're getting lightheaded or dizzy, you know.  Cause sometimes those prostate medications they've got you on can lower your blood pressure.  That doxazosin.

PATIENT X290
Oh, well that never happened before and I've been taking it for so many years.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah, yeah it's fine.  As long as you, and you know if you feel like you're lightheaded, dizzy and you're gonna pass out, I wouldn't take, I would off that day on the medication you know.

PATIENT X290
Well that's never happened so it's good.  

DOCTOR X290
Alright you already got your flu shot back in November.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.  We get that every year.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.  I'm gonna take a listen to you.  Can you take this outer shirt off?  Big deep breath in and out.  Good.  Noticed any lumps or bumps in your neck or in your armpit or your groin?

PATIENT X290
Uh right over here and I took it as the way the dentist was yanking trying to pull, put his finger in my.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah I wouldn't be surprised, especially if you had an infection there too, an infected tooth or anything.  No changes in your vision or hearing recently?

PATIENT X290
I think like, I don't see as good, I need new glasses.  And every once in a while.

DOCTOR X290
Do you see the eye doctor too?

PATIENT X290
I have.  On this side, on the left side, every once in a while I'll get a sharp thing like something's in there but it isn't and it's always this left eye and it's always you know I thought something's in there and I rub it.

DOCTOR X290
And it goes away?

PATIENT X290
Yeah it does.  It may be dust but it's always in the left eye, not the right eye you know and any time of the day.  It doesn't make any difference.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah can you open up real wide?  Lift your tongue up for me, straight up.  Is that the tooth they pulled out on the left?

PATIENT X290
This one.

DOCTOR X290
Oh okay yeah I see.

PATIENT X290
And then they got this one to get.

DOCTOR X290
Okay.

PATIENT X290
But, I want to get a second opinion.  I called up the dentist over here and he says I'm not qualified.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
He said the only time is an emergency and then they charge you $300 and I said well that's more than my dentist.

DOCTOR X290
Can you lay back for me?  Yeah I think it only covers you like for the first three months or something.

PATIENT X290
One of the shots they says and.

DOCTOR X290
You have to be less than three years out of the service or something like that.

PATIENT X290
Yeah and what it says about.

DOCTOR X290
Let me check the left side.

PATIENT X290
If I was wounded or something like that or, anyway I didn't qualify.

DOCTOR X290
I think like the last time, this hernia it's alright now but if you ever notice it gets really painful or red and hot or like blue.

PATIENT X290
Yeah.

DOCTOR X290
Purple, cold and that kind of stuff, you should probably go to the ER, Emergency Room, cause it's always a possibility.  Notice any swelling in your hands or feet?

PATIENT X290
No.

DOCTOR X290
Alright you can sit up now.  Alright.

PATIENT X290
Can I put my shirt on?

DOCTOR X290
Sure.

PATIENT X290
Okay.  It's been a year since I had the eyes checked.

DOCTOR X290
Is that right?

PATIENT X290
I think so.

DOCTOR X290
Do you have an appointment with them?

PATIENT X290
No.  I could just make an appointment with them?

DOCTOR X290
Yeah if they've seen you within the past, I think two years.

PATIENT X290
Oh well I'll check with them then.

DOCTOR X290
You can just call and set up an eye exam you know to make sure that your prescription lenses are right and everything like that.  Uh let me go, let me talk with my boss real quick.

PATIENT X290
Okay.

DOCTOR X290
Just let him know what we're doing and then uh.

PATIENT X290
Okay.

DOCTOR X290
I'll be back in about five minutes alright.

PATIENT X290
Alright, I have my book.

DOCTOR X290
Alright.  Yeah you can sit wherever is comfortable.

PATIENT X290
I'll just have to go.

DOCTOR X290
I think @@@.

PATIENT X290
That's my tea is at work.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.

PATIENT X290
That's the power of this.  Okay.

DOCTOR X290
Five minutes.

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:00  DOCTOR IN:  54:35)

DOCTOR X290
Alright, everything looks good.  I went ahead and refilled your medications.  Oh I put in an order for a colonoscopy.  @@@.

PATIENT X290
Your pen.

DOCTOR X290
Uh when you come back to see me in six months you can just get the labs then and we'll wait.  We'll wait and put the order in then.

PATIENT X290
Order in then.

DOCTOR X290
That way you still have them you know getting your blood drawn today and six months, lets just do it all at one time alright.

PATIENT X290
You mean I get them to draw blood the day I come to see you?

DOCTOR X290
Well.

PATIENT X290
Or a week before?

DOCTOR X290
A week before.

PATIENT X290
A week before yeah.

DOCTOR X290
Yes.  It's usually I'll leave it up to the patient, whatever is most convenient for them.

PATIENT X290
A week before is that what, that's on there.

DOCTOR X290
It worked well for me.  Alright.  Anything else?

PATIENT X290
I think we got it covered.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah I'm pleased that the cholesterol took a nice jump forward.  It was good.  It sounds like the prostate, the PSA is going down too so, you know I think we're making strides across the board.  Alright then, we'll plan on six months then and we'll set up your, we'll set up your colonoscopy at that time.

PATIENT X290
Okay.

DOCTOR X290
Alright.  Alright.

PATIENT X290
Okay.

DOCTOR X290
It's good to see you.

PATIENT X290
Same here I guess.

DOCTOR X290
Yeah.  Looking good.  Just across the hallway here.

PATIENT X290
Okay.

DOCTOR X290
Alright.

DOCTOR X233
Okay cause I was trying to see in your files to see if any lab has been ever done on you and the answer is no.

PATIENT X233
No you're my first doctor I've seen since I've been back.

DOCTOR X233
In October?

PATIENT X233
Yeah cause in October I didn't really see a doctor.  I saw the physician, or the person.

DOCTOR X233
The nurse practitioner?

PATIENT X233
That does my paperwork and I got a flu shot that day in October.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.

PATIENT X233
And then that's it and @@@.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.  Then we probably have to have you come back and do labs, screening blood work, including your cholesterol.

PATIENT X233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X233

PATIENT X233
I'm good.

DOCTOR X233
Now I'm trying to see the last time you were here; you're blood pressure was really not that bad, it was like 130/72 and today it is @@@.

PATIENT X233
That blood pressure is over and it can be like one day like I came in, in the service is a perfect example.  I came in one day to check, everybody was getting their medical check so I came in, got my blood pressure checked and it was extremely high and they're like we need to see you the next day.  I came in it was way low so they like we can't really tell with you and I'm like I know cause it's off.  I can come in one day and people are like you're gonna die and then the next day you're okay.  My blood pressure goes up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.  Stress, non-stress, what I eat, what I don't eat, what I've done for the day, if I relax all day, @@@.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.

PATIENT X233
Forget it; you'll be like this guy is driving me nuts with the blood pressure.

DOCTOR X233
No I mean it's time to spend a little time that you come in.  Let's say its high today and tomorrow its fine and you come back once a month later and its high I need to maybe just start you on something.  I mean that is your choice @@@.

PATIENT X233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X233
So then we can go from there @@@.  Did you try a weight loss program @@@ military worked out?

PATIENT X233
No thanks.

DOCTOR X233
Which is fine.

PATIENT X233
No.  I had to speak to nutritionists.

DOCTOR X233
Where here?

PATIENT X233
No in the service.  They sent me to; when you are overweight they send you to a nutritionist right away.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.

PATIENT X233
And you got to sit there and listen to her, uh eat this portion with this and this and this, I'm like can you multiply that by five so I can actually have a good meal?

DOCTOR X233
Well I guess it's the portion size that.

PATIENT X233
Oh yeah, yeah.  That kind of stuff never worked for me.  Never worked, they're like okay main thing, I was like are you serious.  I then think I don't need to live.

DOCTOR X233
How so you've been hypertensive since what age?  How long have you had the hypertension?

PATIENT X233
Hypertensive is what?

DOCTOR X233
Like high blood pressure.

PATIENT X233
High blood pressure.

DOCTOR X233
Yeah that they started you on the medicine you stopped taking?

PATIENT X233
Uh, let's see when I actually fully got checked out, I'd say maybe in '97 when I joined the Marine Corps and then I was in there for four years and I had and then I got out.

DOCTOR X233
You had it in '97?

PATIENT X233
'97 the blood pressure and they gave me meds and I stopped taking it there and I got out for five years, joined the Army, started me on the medication there and then I stopped taking it so it's like.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.  So maybe since '97, wow that's pretty young and you're 34 right?

PATIENT X233
That's because, yes 34.

DOCTOR X233
That's because what?

PATIENT X233
I was uh a very big boy when I was younger.

DOCTOR X233
How big?

PATIENT X233
Uh fat.  I went in @@@.

DOCTOR X233
You're 246 pounds now.

PATIENT X233
Yeah I was about that when I joined the Marine Corps and then within three months I came out I was 175 pounds, so in three months I lost all that weight and then a month later.

DOCTOR X233
From 250, 200?

PATIENT X233
To 180, cause I was called a fat recruit with training with all the lines and I was on diet rations, all that crap and a month after I got out, I was back up again.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.

PATIENT X233
I cleared the systems and I was like bloop, not 250 but I was back up to like 220, 225, you know like that or back up, hey you're fat for your height.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.

PATIENT X233
So.  

DOCTOR X233
So something for @@@ in the past right.

PATIENT X233
Yeah if I went back to the Marine Corps boot camp whatever they had me doing there, the exercise and the sledding and uh night life and @@@ all the plain stuff that they made me.

DOCTOR X233
Okay and then you said your left eye is itching?

PATIENT X233
Yeah.

DOCTOR X233
What's going on?

PATIENT X233
I don't know, it just started itching.  I think it's because I had dirty hands or something and I touched my eye at work or something but it just feels funny and it's a little puffy.

DOCTOR X233
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X233
This is day two.

DOCTOR X233
Anything coming out of it?

PATIENT X233
No.

DOCTOR X233
Has it be more red than usual?

PATIENT X233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X233
Has your eye been pink?

PATIENT X233
I don't know if it's pink but its red, its looks to be red.

DOCTOR X233
Right now it's red?

PATIENT X233
Can you tell, I don't know, is there any difference or not?

DOCTOR X233
It just looks swollen.

PATIENT X233
It looks swollen okay.  I can feel it when I just move my eyeball.

DOCTOR X233
It just feels dry?

PATIENT X233
No not dry.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.  

PATIENT X233
It itches.

DOCTOR X233
What have you tried on it or did you just let it?

PATIENT X233
I let it, I went into school this morning and I asked some of the mothers that go to school with me what to do and they're like don't do nothing just go get it checked out and get antibiotics so like okay.  I like to ask the moms.  They know best.  You know like Visine, flushing the eyes and see what happened.

DOCTOR X233
Probably wouldn't help.

PATIENT X233
That's why I ask the moms.

DOCTOR X233
Have a seat up here.  @@@.  Open your mouth, say ah and stick out your tongue, ah.

PATIENT X233
Ah.

DOCTOR X233
Okay good.  I want you to swallow for me.  Swallow for me again.  

PATIENT X233
Is it weird that sometimes my Adam's apple gets stuck and I got to shift it back.

DOCTOR X233
(laughter)

PATIENT X233
Into place, is that funny?

DOCTOR X233
Um.

PATIENT X233
Or does that happen @@@.

DOCTOR X233
Um I'm not really; I never had anyone mention that.

PATIENT X233
No but it's like I'll be laying down on my pillow and it like shifts and I have to pop it back into place.

DOCTOR X233
How often does it happen?

PATIENT X233
Oh it's weird, on occasion yeah.  I don't mind, it's like oh let me shift it back that kind of thing.

DOCTOR X233
Yeah, take a deep breath in for me.  Can you lay back?  I'm just going to go around your belly.  Do you want to try the Nutrition Help here?  No.

PATIENT X233
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X233
Alright go ahead and sit up.  When do you think you'll be back to get the labs done?

PATIENT X233
If you want I could be back next week Thursday.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.

PATIENT X233
That's my day off.  @@@ after school.  I would like to, also if I could, is there a possible way and how much it would cost if I get a vasectomy done, is it possible?

DOCTOR X233
Why are we doing it? 

PATIENT X233
Because I'm done having children.  I love my babies.

DOCTOR X233
How many kids do you have?

PATIENT X233
I have two, one girl and one boy, 8 and 6.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.

PATIENT X233
Yeah.

DOCTOR X233
I'm not sure, I'm not sure if it's at the VA.  I doubt it's a procedure where it's going to be, they would pay for it.  Have you ever looked into that to see if they would pay for it?

PATIENT X233
When I was in I wanted to do it but I kept, my supervisor, whatever sergeant, he kept saying put it off, put it off, you can't do it, we got this to do.  So I wanted to get it done when I went, I was able to get it done because I was going to talk to the doctor to get it done and get it paid for while I was in.

DOCTOR X233
Oh.

PATIENT X233
But the thing is now I'm out and I'm with the VA now, how much out of pocket or what.

DOCTOR X233
I don't know.

PATIENT X233
See that's what I need to find, I don't know who to speak to to find out all that's involved.

DOCTOR X233
I would have to check and see.

PATIENT X233
Okay.

DOCTOR X233
Okay, I'll be back.

PATIENT X233
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  47:04  DOCTOR IN:  54:42)

DOCTOR X233
Alright good news is I can get you refills for that @@@ and you would have to, you would have to talk to the urologist and then they'll let you know.

PATIENT X233
Okay.

DOCTOR X233
@@@.  So I'm going to do a nurse recheck of your blood pressure.  We could go two ways, if it's consistently high, like obviously in the 140s then I would have to say we need to start you on the medicine okay.  I'll recheck, let me recheck the blood pressure now.  

PATIENT X233
That @@@ shouldn't even be around my gut.

DOCTOR X233
@@@.

PATIENT X233
That's what I'm going to school for and I'm like @@@.

DOCTOR X233
Oh really.

PATIENT X233
@@@.

DOCTOR X233
@@@ turned @@@ down.

PATIENT X233
Oh, you've got a way to figure it out.

DOCTOR X233
What @@@ today.

PATIENT X233
She gave me the pneumonia.

DOCTOR X233
Pneumovax.

PATIENT X233
The Pneumovax.  

DOCTOR X233
It's a little bit higher but it has to be better than both the numbers she got.  140/90.

PATIENT X233
What'd she get?

DOCTOR X233
150/87.  So both numbers are high.  So I would say overall the good news is if you do try to @@@ even though I know you don't, you are okay with your weight, at least kind of watch what you eat.  Do you eat out a lot?

PATIENT X233
Yes every day.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.  Watching what you eat, low sodium diet, no honestly because sodium kind of ties in to high blood pressure.  So if you're eating out a lot, there's a lot more processed foods and um you're more prone to be hypertensive.  That's just the bottom line and then the other stuff would be as far as you know, I know what you know you were on medication, but at some point you were no longer on meds then if your weight does come down and you're watching what you eat you may not need the medicines.  For blood pressure, for cholesterol and the more your weight goes up the more you'll be prone to be snoring a lot at night.  Some people, I'm sure you've heard, have to use a CPAP, the mask that you use to sleep.  I mean, I'm just giving you things to think about.

PATIENT X233
Okay.

DOCTOR X233
As far as long term issue.  I'm not trying to scare you or anything.  Just give you something to think about.

PATIENT X233
Uh yeah, they're all just like oh Lord.

DOCTOR X233
And as far as like the eye stuff, I'm not giving you any antibiotics, this could go up @@@ and usually what people do is use like just very warm compresses, like your washcloth.

PATIENT X233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X233
And like really warm water and you just put it over it and it should get better within a couple days.

PATIENT X233
Okay.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.  I'll go ahead and order your labs and um so you said sometime this week right?

PATIENT X233
Yes.

DOCTOR X233
It's usually better, can you come in the morning cause you should not have eaten anything cause we'll be checking your cholesterol.

PATIENT X233
Let's see Tuesday morning is the only morning I can squeeze in or Friday morning.

DOCTOR X233
Okay.  You can come whenever you want @@@.

PATIENT X233
Okay.

DOCTOR X233
We're checking the blood cholesterol and let me see @@@.

PATIENT X233
Can I do a warm pack night combo something else because.

DOCTOR X233
@@@.

PATIENT X233
Because like there's nothing I could put on my eye right now just like a warm compact plus?

DOCTOR X233
Uh uh.

PATIENT X233
Something. 

DOCTOR X233
Just the warm compresses.

PATIENT X233
I'm trying to nuke this thing; I don't want it to last three days.

DOCTOR X233
Just try to make sure it doesn't get infected.  I'll put in your referral and your contact number is PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT X233
Yes it is.

DOCTOR X233
And I think you're all set.  You should hear from me sometime next week or in two weeks to follow up with the labs and the nurse visit is really important.  Probably the day you come and get the labs drawn to get a blood pressure check okay.

PATIENT X233
Okay.

DOCTOR X233
Anything else?

PATIENT X233
Nope.

DOCTOR X233
Um and hopefully I'll be seeing you more regularly in the meantime.

PATIENT X233
No I don't want uh, I don't like coming to the hospital regularly.

DOCTOR X233
So for now, let's see we can follow up.

PATIENT X233
Now as you can see the last time I was here was in October.

DOCTOR X233
You can follow up in about six months.

PATIENT X233
Okay.  That's fine.

DOCTOR X233
And maybe sooner it depends on what the labs show how about that?

PATIENT X233
Okay.  That's fine.

DOCTOR X233
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X233
I go downstairs?

DOCTOR X233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X233
Okay.

DOCTOR X233
@@@.

PATIENT X233

DOCTOR X604

PATIENT X604
Yeah I brought my counts to make sure.

DOCTOR X604
Can I see that?

PATIENT X604
Um I have a nurse that come see me every Thursday.  She takes my blood pressure all the day.  She did that yesterday on the form at the top back over here.  I check it at least twice a day.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.  Uh oh your blood sugars are high.

PATIENT X604
They be uh.

DOCTOR X604

PATIENT X604
Oh now I'll be, when I get up in the morning I check it.

DOCTOR X604
Hmm.

PATIENT X604
Or if I feel crazy sometime I check my sugar and my blood pressure.  Then at night before I go to bed I checks it.

DOCTOR X604
But it always at least after two hours after eating?  Cause if you eat dinner.

PATIENT X604
I don't remember, to tell you the truth doc I ain't never checked it two hours after I eat.

DOCTOR X604
No but it's, I mean it's not like you eat at 9 and then you check it at 10, you don't do that right?  It has to be at least two hours after eating.

PATIENT X604
I have never checked it two hours after I eat.

DOCTOR X604
Well when do you check it then?

PATIENT X604
I check in the morning before I have breakfast.

DOCTOR X604
I know but at night when you check it.

PATIENT X604
I told you I check it every morning.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604
Before I eat breakfast.

DOCTOR X604
Yes.

PATIENT X604
Then I checks it in the evening before I eat supper.

DOCTOR X604
Okay so it's before you eat at dinner.

PATIENT X604
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X604
Okay.

PATIENT X604
Every one of those times is before I eat a meal.

DOCTOR X604
Well do you have your meter with you today?

PATIENT X604
Uh uh.  I leave it at home.

DOCTOR X604
Because you know it might not be working properly.

PATIENT X604
And you know something doctor.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604
I, there's some times it might from them strips that I turn in, some bad strips.  You know one of those strips that I turn in?

DOCTOR X604
Oh no they were bad, they weren't working?

PATIENT X604
@@@.

DOCTOR X604
Oh.

PATIENT X604
And I had some of them and some of them counts as some of them still and my machine ain't no young machine, it's a old one.

DOCTOR X604
You need to bring it in so we can make sure that it's actually working right.  Um your diabetes is definitely not well controlled.

PATIENT X604
I can see that.

DOCTOR X604
Okay and it needs to be controlled a lot better.

PATIENT X604
And I can check it three times enough, that ain't no problem.

DOCTOR X604
It's not a matter of checking it three times, it's a matter of making sure your monitor is working right and then it's a matter of uh you know maybe adjusting your medication or increase it.

PATIENT X604
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X604
And I think we probably do at this point.

PATIENT X604
I was on 20 units and they raised it to 22.

DOCTOR X604
You're on 22 right?

PATIENT X604
Yes ma'am I am.

DOCTOR X604
Okay.  Are you taking, but you're not taking anything else for diabetes right?

PATIENT X604
All I'm taking is what you gave me.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604
I was on two but I got scheduled at @@@ and he took me off of it.  I had went into a semi-coma cause of that, it was too low.

DOCTOR X604
And when was that?

PATIENT X604
Oh back in the summer.  It happened to me like three times.  @@@ I call it.

DOCTOR X604
What?

PATIENT X604
@@@.  You go down real fast when this happens.

DOCTOR X604
@@@ disease.

PATIENT X604
Oh I don't take it now, DOCTOR took me off it.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604
I was scared of it.  It was dangerous.  Like you know make my sugars drop too low.

DOCTOR X604
Yeah.

PATIENT X604
And now I'm only like uh with what's the name?

DOCTOR X604
Hmm.  So it looks like in January they had increased to 26 units.

PATIENT X604
Well I ain't, @@@.  I ain't never took no 26.

DOCTOR X604
Why?

PATIENT X604
On my vial I only take the 22.

DOCTOR X604
Okay.

PATIENT X604
Maybe that's the problem.

DOCTOR X604
And you finished five days of steroids right, for your knee?

PATIENT X604
Is it what I was taking for the gout?

DOCTOR X604
Yes.  It was, you were taking it at the beginning.

PATIENT X604
Uh they send me a.

DOCTOR X604

PATIENT X604
Yeah, yes ma'am I guess that was the name of it.  I took it like they told me and it helped that.

DOCTOR X604
No problem with the pain okay.

PATIENT X604
But they know they can say they won't give it to no diabetic, that's what they said but I then @@@ instruction only.

DOCTOR X604
Okay.  How much are you eating?  How's that going?

PATIENT X604
I got a good appetite sometimes.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604
And like, well my nurse you know, that's the home nurse from the doctor in the Mobile Unit and I wouldn't, wasn't really giving me a good appetite, I didn't want no more of that Ensure meal.  They got a meal pill for me for a diabetic.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604
And they claim they don't have it but they do have it and I know that.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604
And I want to know why I can't have it.  Ma'am.

DOCTOR X604
Yes.

PATIENT X604
I drink some milk, like it.

DOCTOR X604
Milk?

PATIENT X604
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X604
Okay.

PATIENT X604
It really gives me a appetite.

DOCTOR X604
Okay.  Ensure?

PATIENT X604

PATIENT X604
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X604
Okay.

PATIENT X604
And my nurse had gave me.

DOCTOR X604
Oh you're wondering why they can't prescribe it to you.

PATIENT X604
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X604
Oh, I don't actually normally prescribe that's something, because that's something you can buy over-the-counter.  I can ask DOCTOR.

PATIENT X604
I can't afford that kind of milk over-the-counter.

DOCTOR X604
Yeah I mean.

PATIENT X604
The things they gave me.

DOCTOR X604
Wait, it's not a medication.  It's just a supplement.

PATIENT X604
It's a medication for me.

DOCTOR X604
Unfortunately it's not a medication for everybody, so it's not something that we can provide.

PATIENT X604
They said @@@.

DOCTOR X604
I can talk with DOCTOR and ask her, you know how they do it.

PATIENT X604
But, what they saying they didn't have it.  She gave me uh, she wrote it down for me.

DOCTOR X604
@@@.

PATIENT X604
But they gave me all the Ensure that I want.

DOCTOR X604
Yeah, I don't know.

PATIENT X604
But that don't really make @@@ who.

DOCTOR X604
Yeah, you want to make sure.

PATIENT X604
Just want to make sure yeah.  I had some but then I used it up and they wrote me a prescription for it.

DOCTOR X604
Yeah I don't think I've ever written a prescription for that but we can ask DOCTOR and see.

PATIENT X604
I'm talking about for the Ensure.

DOCTOR X604
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X604

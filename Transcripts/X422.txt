PATIENT X422
Yeah.

DOCTOR X422
Fine.  How um, how have your sugars been?

PATIENT X422
She can tell you everything.

THIRD PERSON X422
No I've been checking his blood pressures.  He has not been checking his sugars.  So I got a record of his blood pressure.

DOCTOR X422
Oh perfect.

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X422
That's my doctor at home.

DOCTOR X422
Oh good.

THIRD PERSON X422
And this medicine they went up uh.  I believe DOCTOR took him off of it.

DOCTOR X422
Yeah.

PATIENT X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
Most of his blood sugars look good.  I know they're a little higher today.

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh-huh, thank you.

DOCTOR X422
What we could do.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
We can always go up @@@.

PATIENT X422
She's not the doctor.  Make sure what time I'm gonna take my medicine or I got a sweet wife.

DOCTOR X422
It looks like your @@@ are off a bit.

PATIENT X422
See so I called.

DOCTOR X422
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X422
To get it.

DOCTOR X422
Yeah refilled and then they didn't want to yeah.

PATIENT X422
They said we don't have that number and that was it.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  We'll refill, I'm gonna refill that for you.  Okay it looks like he had it on the record like it's supposed to be on there.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.  Thank you.

PATIENT X422
They can send it out right?

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  They do, so you didn't take this this morning right?

THIRD PERSON X422
No.

PATIENT X422
No.

DOCTOR X422
Okay and yesterday neither?

THIRD PERSON X422
We haven't had it for two weeks or more.

PATIENT X422
Past two weeks.

DOCTOR X422
Two weeks.

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X422
Right.

THIRD PERSON X422
They said @@@ out.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  We may just add on the.

PATIENT X422
Yeah cause I called about this.

DOCTOR X422
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X422
And they said we don't have it on record.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  And I know your sugars were good back in December too they were saying.  They had checked kind of a three month.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay right.

DOCTOR X422
That looked good.  I think we may check another one today to see how your sugars have been.  It's a blood test that they check to see how your sugars have been averaging over the last three months.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
So we'll do that today too.

THIRD PERSON X422
Now they said for PATIENT to take just the insulin at home, that is the 35 units he takes at night.  He doesn't do good when he has to take that at night.

DOCTOR X422
In the morning.

THIRD PERSON X422
Right.  What I had did when he first started on it.

DOCTOR X422
Uh-huh.

THIRD PERSON X422
I was giving it to him in the morning.

DOCTOR X422
Okay, that's okay.

THIRD PERDON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
That's okay cause that should be the last thing cause we want some time you know.  That's fine.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
In the morning is fine as long.

THIRD PERSON X422
Thank you.

DOCTOR X422
Since his sugars looked okay um back in September so I'm okay with keeping that level of insulin.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR X422
Uh-huh so we'll keep that as well.  And I know you saw the eye doctor and the foot doctor so that's good and how's your knee?

PATIENT X422
They talked to me about feet down feet.  What it is, they stiffen up.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.

PATIENT X422
And it's hard to get, see you have to push up.  Now that was just a little easy but to sit.

DOCTOR X422
That's what the problem is okay.

PATIENT X422
And they said that they're not gonna put new ones in there.

DOCTOR X422
What they, they said yeah.

PATIENT X422
They did sometimes they get, if they get hard to get up.

DOCTOR X422
It gets hard to get up okay.  I think one of the things that they were recommending was to set you up with the physical therapist to see if we can get you know some sort of stretches or something to kind of help you pushing up the muscles around there to see if maybe it would make it a little easier.

PATIENT X422
I gotta do something with it.

DOCTOR X422
So I'd like to send you back to see if you need to see the physical therapist okay to see you know what they can do to help you out there.

PATIENT X422
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X422
A little bit yeah okay.

THIRD PERSON X422
Because he has a very hard time getting up at home too.

DOCTOR X422
Oh I saw that.  

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X422
It took you a while to get up out of the chair.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

PATIENT X422
It takes me longer than that.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.

PATIENT X422
Cause that chair hits me right in the knee cap.

DOCTOR X422
Sure okay.  And then let me check to make sure you have.  Any other medications that should be refilled?

THIRD PERSON X422
No, no.

PATIENT X422
No.

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X422
Okay and um and your blood tests back in September looked pretty good and we only check them out once every few months anyway.  The only one is the one for checking your blood sugars when you come in and I think it would be good to check it again.

PATIENT X422
I feel fine.  I'm not gonna take beat around the bush cause some guys said they feel violated and insulted.

DOCTOR X422
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X422
But I try to take care of myself.

DOCTOR X422
Good.

PATIENT X422
And my wife looks out after me too.

THIRD PERSON X422
Yeah I do.

DOCTOR X422
Right.  @@@ and I know they sent you for the, let me check and see how your, how the blood flow was in your legs too.

THIRD PERSON X422
That's the right.

DOCTOR X422
Your right leg looks good.  You just have a little bit of; you know how they say in the heart arteries you can have some plaque build up?

THIRD PERSON X422
Right.

DOCTOR X422
Well on the left side you did have a little bit.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
Um so, one other thing I'm gonna check it.  You're already on the aspirin which is what we recommend doing for that anyway.

THIRD PERSON X422
That's good to know.

DOCTOR X422
So.

PATIENT X422
But when its, she's the one who knows all of my medicines.

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X422
Yeah I know, DOCTOR called.

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh-huh.  Yeah for management.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay we have this thing that helps him get up.

DOCTOR X422
Uh-huh.

THIRD PERSON X422

DOCTOR X422
Okay.

THIRD PERSON X422
Like a seat.  They fit on the seat.

DOCTOR X422

THIRD PERSON X422
Pushes like it came up.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.

THIRD PERSON X422
I'm hoping we get PATIENT a new chair for him.

DOCTOR X422
Oh it's a chair.

THIRD PERSON X422
Yeah.  I want a chair that's leather.

DOCTOR X422
Yeah.

THIRD PERSON X422
And that thing, it would tear your furniture.

DOCTOR X422
Sure, sure.  Let me find out.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
Cause I'm not sure about that um so we could go with a new chair though okay.

PATIENT X422
Okay.

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh-huh.  See he has a cold.  Want me to help you up honey?  @@@.

DOCTOR X422
You know what; let me lay you back first.

THIRD PERSON X422
(Laughter)

PATIENT X422
Okay.

THIRD PERSON X422

THIRD PERSON X422
That's a @@@.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.

PATIENT X422
It doesn't bother me.

DOCTOR X422
It's up to you so.  Alright let's take a listen okay.

THIRD PERSON X422
He has a cold.

DOCTOR X422
That's okay.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
Any fevers or anything like that at home?

PATIENT X422
No not that I know of no fevers.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  Okay.  Nice deep breaths.  Deep breath again and again.  Any neck pain at all?

PATIENT X422
No pain.  Well down here in my.

THIRD PERSON X422
Low back.

PATIENT X422

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  Just breathe normally.  Any belly pain, trouble eating?

PATIENT X422

DOCTOR X422
Any pains or anything like that?

THIRD PERSON X422

DOCTOR X422
Oh.  Alright let me just check your feet like that.  Any swelling in your feet?

PATIENT X422

DOCTOR X422
Alright and you can have this back.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  45:52  DOCTOR IN:  49:18)

DOCTOR X422
Okay so the deal with the chair is that they want to see you first, the physical therapists.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
They want to do their evaluation and they will maybe be able to get you that were placed and see if you can go up and have you talk with them first but if not then they um, they will get you the appointment @@@ and need to evaluate him for that.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  Alright.  Give me one second let me just put in some of the orders here and then I can see if I can, if I can order it I'll do it but it sounds like it's something we'll just have to have one of the other doctors do.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
They have to do the formal evaluation.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
Before they issue that.

THIRD PERSON X422
You know I have to submit it to our health insurance and the man wanted to sign PATIENT up just in case something happens, something happens when we can't get over here at night.  Will he lose his VA if he signed up for that?

DOCTOR X422
That I don't know.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
That either we'll have to; you'll have to check with the Finance Office or something.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
That's something that I don't know.

THIRD PERSON X422
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X422
I actually don't know the answer to that unfortunately.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
So.

THIRD PERSON X422
If nothing I'll just call, call someone who calls me back, it's better than nothing.  Cause I want to find medicine @@@.

DOCTOR X422
So you want to pick it up here or do you want it mailed to you?

THIRD PERSON X422
Uh you can mail it.

PATIENT X422
Mail it.

DOCTOR X422
Mail it okay.

THIRD PERSON X422

DOCTOR X422
Change this over.

THIRD PERSON X422
So far they mail out everything his insulin and everything.

DOCTOR X422
Sure.  Okay I just wanted to make sure.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay cause he'll need the insulin.

DOCTOR X422
Okay.  So we don't uh do the renewals on most of these medicines, some of them in the chart are coming up.

THIRD PERSON X422
Okay.

DOCTOR X422
So that you know just when you need to call it in but.

THIRD PERSON X422

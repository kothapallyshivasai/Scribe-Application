DOCTOR X65
Oh you don't have the list, that's okay.

PATIENT X65
I'm on uh 60 mg of Actonel @@@ every day.

DOCTOR X65
Atenolol okay.  Is that for depression?

PATIENT X65
I'm on.  Yes uh-huh and it's usually once a day but I haven't taken my pill today so.

DOCTOR X65
Oh okay.

PATIENT X65
Probably my blood pressure is a little high.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.  It will be.

PATIENT X65
Um I'm also on @@@ which is fish oil, @@@.

DOCTOR X65

PATIENT X65
It's 4 mg a day.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.

PATIENT X65
Oh I'm sorry 4 grams a day, 4 milligrams.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.

PATIENT X65
Milligrams a day, pretty low, 4 grams.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.

PATIENT X65
And I'm on Nexium 40 mg of Nexium.  I think that I, I don't know I'm putting weight on like crazy and I mean my diet is not the greatest and I don't have a lot of exercise but I mean just to put.  I work at another part-time company and I work full-time during the week and I got two kids and you know so I'm moving around a lot.  It's like I'm just sitting there you know.

DOCTOR X65
Right.

PATIENT X65
And it's like as soon as I started some of these @@@.  I feel bloated and you know.

DOCTOR X65
Well let me examine you.  If you mind taking off your shoes and socks and then taking a seat right here okay.

PATIENT X65
You asked about diabetes.

DOCTOR X65
Yes.

PATIENT X65
Obviously a drop in sugar would be typical for diabetes right.

DOCTOR X65
Um drop in sugar could, I mean you mean with dizziness?

PATIENT X65
Once in a while, like just now before I was here, @@@ too I'm sweating here but um.  I have this thing where I feel sort of like I have pain in my stomach like a real hunger pain, hunger pain.

DOCTOR X65
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X65
And I'll start sweating and I'll start feeling shaky.

DOCTOR X65
Oh okay.

PATIENT X65
Like I thought that might be due.

DOCTOR X65
Yeah it could be if you don't have enough insulin.

PATIENT X65
Right.

DOCTOR X65
To settle the sugar into the cells then your cells think that there isn't any sugar around and it could have that type of affect on you and sometimes people who have.

PATIENT X65
You want my socks off too?

DOCTOR X65
Yes I do.

PATIENT X65
Uh you might not.

DOCTOR X65
Please, you can only imagine what I smell @@@.

PATIENT X65
I can't smell.

DOCTOR X65
I know.  You might have a problem.  So uh sometimes insulin insensitivity can manifest by skin tags on the neck.

PATIENT X65
I have a lot of them.

DOCTOR X65
Yeah they will probably ask you to test your sugars.

PATIENT X65
@@@ good.  I mean I was fasting.

DOCTOR X65
When was that?

PATIENT X65
My God it's been a while, I think seven or eight months.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.  Here have a seat.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
Um no let me just @@@.  Let me start with @@@.  @@@ eyes @@@.  The @@@ tight.  Open and raise your eyebrows, @@@.  Good @@@.  Lifting your arms, turn your palms up, @@@ good.  And the right @@@ lift it towards the ceiling @@@.  @@@.  Okay.  Push me away, good, @@@ good.  How about turn your toes up @@@.  Good.  Alright @@@.  That has to do with reflexes.

PATIENT X65
@@@ too is reflex.  @@@ where I get like a shakiness I have.  

DOCTOR X65
Yeah.  And when was the last time you ate?

PATIENT X65
Uh 11 o'clock and then I got one of those @@@ bags or whatever the.

DOCTOR X65
Right.  @@@.  Hold your arms like this and on the count of three I want you to pull, one, two, three pull, good.  Okay one, two, three pull good and let your foot drop.  I'm going to pick it up so I can help you.

PATIENT X65

DOCTOR X65
Just let it drop in my hand.

PATIENT X65

DOCTOR X65
Good, @@@.  Deep breath, good and another one, good.  @@@.

PATIENT X65
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X65
@@@.

PATIENT X65
Yes.

DOCTOR X65
How about this?

PATIENT X65
Yes.

DOCTOR X65
How about this?

PATIENT X65
Yes.

DOCTOR X65
Good.  I'm lift this finger up and down, this is up, this is down, I want you to @@@.

PATIENT X65
Up, up, down, up, down.

DOCTOR X65
Okay, so.  Go ahead and have a seat.  @@@ further down.  Anything when I press?  @@@?

PATIENT X65
Where do I get the pain?

DOCTOR X65
Yes.

PATIENT X65
Right here.

DOCTOR X65
@@@.

PATIENT X65
Yes.  A little farther down?

DOCTOR X65
Here?

PATIENT X65
Right about here.

DOCTOR X65
Right about there good.  @@@.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
Have you had any @@@ there?

PATIENT X65
Uh not that I know of no.

DOCTOR X65
Okay @@@. Alrighty.

PATIENT X65
@@@.  I actually went to a masseuse to @@@ because of the pain.

DOCTOR X65
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X65
And when she would push on my low back it really hurt.

DOCTOR X65
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X65
But eventually it started feeling better.

DOCTOR X65
Yeah, sit up uh-huh that's good.  @@@.  Tell me if it hurts when I press on your bone.

PATIENT X65
Right here.

DOCTOR X65
There.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
Yeah.

PATIENT X65
@@@ on both sides but um, @@@.

DOCTOR X65
@@@.  Right here?

PATIENT X65
Uh-huh and when I was little @@@.  I've had this one since I was born.

DOCTOR X65
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X65
This one just showed up not like, maybe within a year and a half.

DOCTOR X65
@@@.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
Okay, have a seat.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
@@@ not all of them.  Um.

PATIENT X65
Can I put my socks back on again?

DOCTOR X65
So, regarding your hip and your legs.  The reason why it's your hip is because groin pain a lot of times is because of a hip problem um.  When people have pain in their hip it radiates to their groin.  Now the side pain I think.

PATIENT X65
Sciatica?

DOCTOR X65
No, it's not sciatica.  I don't think it's sciatica at least but um it could be that you have a little bit of a disk herniation.  Cause you're telling me you have burning in that area.  Does it sometimes feel @@@ at all?

PATIENT X65
@@@ burning @@@.  It sometimes feels like its throbbing @@@.

DOCTOR X65
Right.

PATIENT X65
So.

DOCTOR X65
And so that makes me think its neuropathic pain like sometimes when the disk bulges and hits @@@ spinal cord a little bit.  So and for that type of pain there's something called gabapentin which is for burning.

PATIENT X65
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X65
Nerve pain.

PATIENT X65
@@@ nerves.  I've had tests on my hands.

DOCTOR X65
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X65
They say the nerves in my thumb are shot.

DOCTOR X65
Oh, where they put the needle in there and.

PATIENT X65
They put an electric shock on my hand.

DOCTOR X65
Right, right.

PATIENT X65
And they said @@@ cause I had the carpal tunnel the VA took care of.

DOCTOR X65
Right.

PATIENT X65
But uh doctor out there tried to put me on uh Cymbalta.

DOCTOR X65
Yeah.

PATIENT X65
For nerve pain.

DOCTOR X65
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X65
I never took it.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.

PATIENT X65
@@@ but.

DOCTOR X65
So the gabapentin, I know you said you worked with machines.

PATIENT X65
I work with machines.

DOCTOR X65
Gabapentin can make you sleepy but that's if you start taking it the 300 mg three times a day.  What I would recommend is the following.  I want to get uh an x-ray of your hip.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
And if @@@ and then you had those spine films which look fine but you could be getting some neuropathic pain.  I think an MRI would be a good idea.  Are you claustrophobic?

PATIENT X65
No.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.  So um, have you had an MRI before?

PATIENT X65
Yeah.

DOCTOR X65
Okay so @@@.

PATIENT X65
I can't.

DOCTOR X65
@@@.

PATIENT X65
My wife @@@, 11 years ago, 12 years ago.

DOCTOR X65
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
Okay, alright.  So we'll set you up for a @@@ if you're claustrophobic or not.

PATIENT X65
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X65
Um, just to see if the disk is coming out and um, @@@ test I want to do and in the meantime for this pain because of the discomfort that you're having I want to start the gabapentin and that is a dose that can be titrated up to 1000 mg three times a day.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
I'm gonna start you on a lower dose though because it can really knock you out if you take it.

PATIENT X65
Is this an anti-inflammatory or?

DOCTOR X65
No it's not.  It is specifically for this burning, throbbing pain.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
But I want you to start taking 300 mg at night.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
And then.

PATIENT X65
For the neuropathic pain.

DOCTOR X65
@@@ at night and then you build tolerance to it and then you take it twice a day, once at night for a week then twice a day
for a week and then three times a day.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
If you notice at any time that one of those doses makes you too sleepy then go back to the lower dose two times a day or one time a day.

PATIENT X65
I can mix with the meds I do now?

DOCTOR X65
Yeah, definitely yes.

PATIENT X65
@@@ I mean like I said it got real bad.  Well I had heat stroke.

DOCTOR X65
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X65
And this Nexium, I first had uh what's that stuff called, @@@ no, no it's the other.

DOCTOR X65
Prilosec.

PATIENT X65
It's a @@@ something else.

DOCTOR X65
Lansoprazole.

PATIENT X65
Yes.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.

PATIENT X65
I had that and I started getting, I had my statin at the time for my cholesterol.

DOCTOR X65
Oh no.

PATIENT X65
Oh yeah I took it and oh God.

DOCTOR X65
Oh no.

PATIENT X65
And so I started and then I lost some weight then I was looking at doing herbal stuff and @@@ for a while and I DOCTOR approved that fish oil.

DOCTOR X65
I'm glad you brought that up so the weight issue.

PATIENT X65
Yeah.

DOCTOR X65
And with any time of uh like muscular pain.  Especially if you have some disk herniation, the weight loss.

PATIENT X65
Weight loss right.

DOCTOR X65
The @@@.

PATIENT X65
Oh how do you, the @@@ makes you gain weight.

DOCTOR X65
Right.

PATIENT X65
I know doctors say some of that is not true.

DOCTOR X65
Right.

PATIENT X65
But every @@@ that I've talked to.

DOCTOR X65
@@@.

PATIENT X65
30 or 40 pounds of weight gain within a short time.

DOCTOR X65
Yeah.  Um, that's why @@@.  Well in terms of specifics, especially because you have @@@ ulcers, @@@ is important.

PATIENT X65
Yes.

DOCTOR X65
Um and so I know you say you've been trying to eat healthy and you move a lot at work.

PATIENT X65
Definitely right.

DOCTOR X65
And you have consistent activity.

PATIENT X65
Right.

DOCTOR X65
You know instead of short bursts.

PATIENT X65
Right short bursts and whatever right.

DOCTOR X65
What we usually look for is consistent activity to keep your heart rate elevated for a half an hour and so you probably work long hours as well but if there's any way that you can fit in some type of physical activity.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
At least three times a week and then really cut out @@@.

PATIENT X65
@@@ it was like a trail mix.

DOCTOR X65
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X65
The raisins @@@.

DOCTOR X65
Okay, okay, that's not too bad.

PATIENT X65
Sunflowers and.

DOCTOR X65
@@@  But you know eating healthy so um and I'm not saying completely take you out @@@ diet because then people won't do it but if you know @@@ if you have that multiple times a day or multiple times a week just limit it to once a week.  If you have that fluid every day, @@@.  You know @@@.

PATIENT X65
I'm trying to lose some weight though.

DOCTOR X65
Okay, just start and then cut out @@@.

PATIENT X65
@@@.

DOCTOR X65
So stuff like that will help and then hopefully with the losing weight and then the last thing I can give @@@ offer you physical therapy.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
And so they can you know show you strengthening exercises specifically you know after you get the MRI done uh, what we can do is wait to see what the MRI results are and if there are some abnormalities then Physical Therapy can work with you.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
Okay.

PATIENT X65
@@@ therapy?

DOCTOR X65
I don't know.

PATIENT X65
Okay.

DOCTOR X65
@@@ okay.

PATIENT X65

PATIENT X65

DOCTOR X65

PATIENT X65

DOCTOR X65
Well if it's more we can refer you to the dermatologist and you can talk to them also about that.

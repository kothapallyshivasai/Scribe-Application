Okay that can come; I think it comes from the nerves.

DOCTOR X752
But the gabapentin is good for that.

PATIENT X752
That comes from the legs.  I thought it was from the nerves in my back or something.

DOCTOR X752
Okay.

PATIENT X752
And I thought it was because of my age but I still wanted to ask you about it again.

DOCTOR X752
So you've got three refills of this so this one you should be good for.  You've been having the lisinopril; looks like you're due for a refill today.  Do you want today?

DOCTOR X752
Yeah.  So your blood pressure pills you take it, there's one pill its called lisinopril.

PATIENT X752

PATIENT X752
No yeah @@@ to it.  Uh uh, it's supposed to make you dizzy?

DOCTOR X752
Is it supposed to?  No.  I'm just worried, I'm just wondering if it ever drops your blood pressure too low.

PATIENT X752
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

DOCTOR X752
And it might not.  This might be a perfect regimen for you to be on these three pills.  Cause it looks like your blood pressure is a lot better.

PATIENT X752
Yeah but sometimes I'd have to say no.  I've been @@@ for the last, every @@@.  I haven't been stressed out.

DOCTOR X752
Good.

PATIENT X752
I just try to take one of those.

DOCTOR X752
You can take it, so that medicine hydralazine only lasts for a few hours.

PATIENT X752
Oh.

DOCTOR X752
To lower your blood pressure.  It's one of those that if you're not controlled on these two medicines then sometimes we add, we just take @@@ each pill like I'd say lasts for about 6-7 hours okay.

PATIENT X752
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X752
But if you take one in the morning you know and you take one in the afternoon.  Do you ever check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X752
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X752
And what does it usually run?

PATIENT X752
Uh 140 over sometimes 79, 82.

DOCTOR X752
Like 140?

PATIENT X752
Yeah.

DOCTOR X752
Okay so you can take this probably in the afternoon okay.

PATIENT X752
Okay.

DOCTOR X752
So take it twice a day so once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  You probably have a lot of it, the hydralazine.

PATIENT X752
Okay what was the date 1/15?

DOCTOR X752
Yeah.  That's if you took this in the morning probably.

PATIENT X752
Yeah cause I had.

DOCTOR X752

PATIENT X752

DOCTOR X752

DOCTOR X752
So it's kind of like yeah.  That's good that you've lost yeah.  Your labs look good so your blood counts look good they look normal.  Your prostate test that we checked last time was normal okay.

PATIENT X752
Okay that's good.

DOCTOR X752
Um and then we'll check these other blood tests because we want to make sure you don't have another reason to have high blood pressure and it was normal too.

PATIENT X752
Which one was that?

DOCTOR X752

DOCTOR X752
Do you know exactly how long ago you were on that medicine?

PATIENT X752
@@@.  I don't even know.

DOCTOR X752
Okay so a number of years ago.

PATIENT X752
Yeah it's been a couple of years ago.  That's a blood thinner right?

DOCTOR X752
No metoprolol is actually a medicine, when did you have your heart attack?  In 2000?  Around there?

PATIENT X752
Yeah something like that yeah that's it.  And I think I was on, they put me on metoprolol then I think.  What's the blood thinner they had me on?

DOCTOR X752
You might have been, were you on Warfarin or anything like that?  Heparin?

PATIENT X752
Uh uh, I was on metoprolol.

DOCTOR X752
I'm looking back so let's see you were on metoprolol in July of 2000.  So we'll see what was going on then.  Okay.  Okay so you were also on Plavix.

PATIENT X752
Yeah that's what I was trying to think of, Plavix.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah.  How long, you were probably on Plavix for a year or so.

PATIENT X752
Yeah that one, I think I was on metoprolol at the same time.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah you were on them together, so let's see when they took you off.  It looks like you're still on metoprolol in 2001, in 2002; you were still on metoprolol in 2003 so.  

PATIENT X752
And I @@@.

DOCTOR X752
Let's see in 2004 you were still on it and let's see 2005 you were still on it.  You were on it for a long time.

PATIENT X752
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X752
Looks like so the Plavix you were still on in 2005 too.  Even in 2008 you were on the metoprolol but you weren't on the Plavix then.  Let's see what it says.

PATIENT X752
Now why did they take me off the metoprolol?  Seems like the metoprolol gave me @@@.

DOCTOR X752
So you were on the metoprolol for a long time.

PATIENT X752
@@@.

DOCTOR X752
At least so up to 2009 I think you were still on it.

PATIENT X752
Well @@@.

DOCTOR X752
In 2011 you were still on it.  So why did this get discontinued in 2011?  @@@.

PATIENT X752
It was 2011.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah let me look.

PATIENT X752
@@@.  Maybe I couldn't get along with it.

DOCTOR X752
So it looks like you got a stress test done, do you know why they ordered that?

PATIENT X752
Uh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X752
We're cracking open the vault here.  Uh let's see.  I think DOCTOR took you off of it.  Do remember him?

PATIENT X752

DOCTOR X752
Skinny guy.  Yeah.

PATIENT X752

DOCTOR X752

DOCTOR X752

DOCTOR X752
That's where I'm from.

DOCTOR X752
Oh that's where my family lives.

PATIENT X752
Oh they do?

DOCTOR X752
Yeah.

PATIENT X752
I was just.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah that's where @@@.

PATIENT X752
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X752
On the bay.

PATIENT X752
The @@@.  It's hot down there, pretty hot.

DOCTOR X752
Oh was it really hot?

PATIENT X752
Hot, hot, hot.  It was so hot I was in the hotel and when I go outside my glasses would get fogged up boom.  Just like @@@.

DOCTOR X752
You were glad to come back to xxx?

PATIENT X752
It was hot here too though.  Yeah it was still @@@, Sugarland, Texas, I ain't heard of Sugarland.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah people think I'm making it up when I say I'm from Sugarland.

PATIENT X752
No it's a real city, it's real.

DOCTOR X752
It's a real city.

PATIENT X752
It's real.  There was a nice little place, @@@ little stores and malls.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah.

PATIENT X752
Little slot machines, within walking distance of everything.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah it's a nice little suburb.

PATIENT X752
Yeah sort of @@@ with xxx.

DOCTOR X752
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X752
They had good food.

DOCTOR X752
Okay so @@@ too.

PATIENT X752
Alright.

DOCTOR X752
So do you think around the time that you had your heart attack did you use any kind of drug whatsoever back then?  It was a long time ago so you may not remember.

PATIENT X752
Uh 2011.

DOCTOR X752
It was 2000.

PATIENT X752
2000 oh yes I was kind of back on drugs then.

DOCTOR X752
@@@.

PATIENT X752
2011 you say?

DOCTOR X752
In 2000.

PATIENT X752
Oh 2000.

DOCTOR X752
A long time ago.

PATIENT X752
Yeah.

DOCTOR X752
You might have been using cocaine or something like that?

PATIENT X752
I could've yeah.

DOCTOR X752
Could be right so I think why they took you off of that is because I think when they did your stress test.

PATIENT X752
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X752
They didn't see anything with your heart that would predispose you like this just showed that you had a heart attack that caused a lot of damage.

PATIENT X752
Alright cause I stopped doing some of the things I was doing.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah so it got better though.

PATIENT X752
Yeah it did.

DOCTOR X752
So.

PATIENT X752
I stopped a whole lot of things.

DOCTOR X752
Yeah so I think that maybe what could've caused is maybe some cocaine.  Sometimes this causes what they call a spasm in the heart.

PATIENT X752
Right.

DOCTOR X752
It's called a spasm and it looks exactly like a heart attack and it feels exactly like a heart attack and it is.

PATIENT X752
Yes.

DOCTOR X752
So people get a lot of recovery time.

PATIENT X752
Yeah but what's, I've been, okay I been still having an electrocardiogram and everything.

DOCTOR X752
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X752
And I was in the hospital and uh they said I had a heart attack, I had a walking heart attack and wondered if I'd used cocaine but I couldn't use no cocaine cause I was in the hospital.  I had been in the hospital about 2-3 weeks.

DOCTOR X752
Oh @@@ time.

PATIENT X752
Yeah.  Oh come on @@@ heart attack.  @@@ that's what I'm saying.  So @@@.  I had to stay in Intensive Care for a long week.  I think my high blood pressure had a lot to do with @@@.

DOCTOR X752

DOCTOR X752
Yeah.  What @@@.

PATIENT X752

Uh I take lovastatin.

DOCTOR X113
Lovastatin.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Okay were you ever on a medicine called clopidogrel or Plavix for that?  No.

PATIENT X113
I don't think so.

DOCTOR X113
That's alright.

PATIENT X113
I may have.

DOCTOR X113
You may not have been back then but that's okay, that's fine.  Um let's see.

PATIENT X113
Now I took, at one point, let me see what.  I keep calling it metoprolol.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah, yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113

PATIENT X113
No.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Um and where do you get that medicine from?

PATIENT X113

DOCTOR X113
Um okay.  So we have our records as actually taking simvastatin.  Does that, does that?

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Okay so the records show you get all your medicines here.

PATIENT X113
Yeah my medicines come from here.

DOCTOR X113
That would be accurate okay good.

PATIENT X113
I've got like stockpiles of them in the last couple days.  Not that, in the past couple weeks uh.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah you've just been getting more of them.

PATIENT X113
Yeah and so.

DOCTOR X113
@@@ needing it.

PATIENT X113
All of a sudden I got all these uh.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
Pharmaceuticals coming in you know.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT X113
Uh it's straightened out, I mean I know it's hard but.

DOCTOR X113
How have you been feeling lately?

PATIENT X113
Right now my allergies are beating me up.

DOCTOR X113
Do you get allergies every year around this time?

PATIENT X113
No.

DOCTOR X113
So this is kind of new.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
What type of problems are you having?

PATIENT X113
Oh just uh sneezing and sore throat and headache.  You know my sinuses are of course all clogged up.

DOCTOR X113
Okay and are you taking any over-the-counter medicines for that?

PATIENT X113
Yeah I've been taking Zyrtec is that right?

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.  Is that working for you?

PATIENT X113
Ah.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
No.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
You know.  But that's not the only problem I; at the house we redid the kitchen.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
So there's no dry wall.

DOCTOR X113
Right, right, right.

PATIENT X113
Demo, yeah.

DOCTOR X113
You tore it up a lot.

PATIENT X113
Right, on top of the allergies it's you know so.

DOCTOR X113
Alright um, sounds good.  We can see if we can do anything for that.  We have a medicine I think would be a little stronger that Zyrtec you could maybe try.

PATIENT X113
Yeah I talked to the pharmacist there at Walgreen’s.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
And I told him what I was taking.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
And he said here, try the Zyrtec.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.  We can just keep on that then; hopefully it will get better once the dust settles.

PATIENT X113
But like I said if I could get something stronger I'd sure @@@.

DOCTOR X113
It's the same medicine.  You don't know dose your taking do you?

PATIENT X113
Uh I'm taking one every 24 hours so.

DOCTOR X113
So probably @@@ would change is what we can offer for now so keep you going with what your doing.

PATIENT X113
Yeah that's fine.  If you're not going to change it.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
@@@.

DOCTOR X113
Okay um just because this is required that you see me; I got a couple questions for you.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
Um previous surgeries you had your foot surgery in 2008 anything else?

PATIENT X113
Heart.

DOCTOR X113
Oh then you had a heart surgery stent okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X113
And I had a cancer behind my back.

DOCTOR X113
Okay what; I don't have any record but what was done there?

PATIENT X113
No it was done here.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
Uh it's kind of @@@ cancer you know like.

DOCTOR X113
It was like a @@@.

PATIENT X113
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X113
A mole or something?

PATIENT X113
It was more like a pimple.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
That just wouldn't heal.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
And uh, yeah but it was like a kids cancer.

DOCTOR X113
And when was that removed?

PATIENT X113
Uh a couple years ago, last year I think, maybe the year before.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X113
But that was nothing, it was all outpatient.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  2007.

PATIENT X113
Right.

DOCTOR X113
Right yeah.

PATIENT X113
And uh yeah I was in and out of Hematology for quite a while too.  Uh my blood platelets were like off the charts.

DOCTOR X113
Platelets were off yeah.

PATIENT X113
Okay you got that.

DOCTOR X113
Right, got that.  And now they're doing okay as far as you know?

PATIENT X113
As far as I know yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Do you remember when the last time you had it checked was?

PATIENT X113
Uh my understanding it's every time they draw blood uh they get it.

DOCTOR X113
So it was back in December they took a look at it.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
It looked good okay, good.  Alright that's it.  Um I'm looking through your chart.  It looks like family history wise your mother had a stroke?  

PATIENT X113
My mother had a heart attack.

DOCTOR X113
Heart attack.

PATIENT X113
Numerous.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
Three or four.

DOCTOR X113
Did she not have a stroke then?

PATIENT X113
No my mom never had a stroke.

DOCTOR X113
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X113
And my dad either died of a heart attack or a stroke, they don't know what.

DOCTOR X113
And then your brother has hypertension and high blood pressure?

PATIENT X113
Uh one of my brothers.

DOCTOR X113
One of your brothers does.

PATIENT X113
Well it's not hypertension, its more cholesterol related.

DOCTOR X113
Anything else run in the family, cancers or anything like that?

PATIENT X113
No uh it's all like heart.  They all drop dead.

DOCTOR X113
Do you know how old your parents were when they had heart attacks?

PATIENT X113
Oh my mother was young uh, probably in her late 40s her first one and she's had like three or four.  I think she's had three bypasses, separate you know.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Then your dad.

PATIENT X113
He never saw a doctor.  @@@ but he died at 52 of either a heart attack or a stroke; they don't know what killed him.  But he got that taking his pants off.  

DOCTOR X113
Um I have also in the records that you are currently smoking.  Are you still smoking?  Okay.

PATIENT X113
Yeah and it's less.

DOCTOR X113
About one pack a day?

PATIENT X113
You know I kind of laid off.

DOCTOR X113
Great.

PATIENT X113
Okay uh.

DOCTOR X113
But previously you were a lot more, about two packs a day?

PATIENT X113
Yeah I was way up there.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
I was a smoking fool.

DOCTOR X113
And then you've had problems with alcohol in the past too?

PATIENT X113
Yes.

DOCTOR X113
And have you quit?

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
When did you quit?

PATIENT X113
Oh, in the last ten years I've been sober a lot more than I've been drunk really but uh.  I haven't had a drink since January now.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Alright great.  Um let's see and what branch of the military were you?

PATIENT X113
I was in the Navy.  I was a heavy equipment operator in the Seabees.  

DOCTOR X113
Alright.  Um are you living with anybody right now?

PATIENT X113
I live with my sister.

DOCTOR X113
You do okay.  Anything else bothering you besides the allergies we need to talk about?

PATIENT X113
My ankle right now, it's not the ankle itself, so it's starting to be every day.  But the skin.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah.

PATIENT X113
Okay and that's before, sometimes okay but now its four days we're doing all that @@@.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  What's the specific symptom that you have a complaint about today?  Is it like itchiness, dryness?

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Of the skin or is it something else?

PATIENT X113
No it does hurt from time to time.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
I mean it'll get so dry it'll bleed.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
Uh I don't know like once a month.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  You know it looks; it does look definitely really dried out down there.

PATIENT X113
Yes.

DOCTOR X113
And kind of where it is, it's in a bad spot and you tend to rub it up against @@@.

PATIENT X113
Right.

DOCTOR X113
I'd try just having some lotion on it.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
But um, that @@@ stuff or something.  Probably a jar like a emollient or whatever you can get at Walgreen’s or something.  It's kind of like a moisturizer but it's not, it doesn't come in a bottle, a can of it almost.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
Like an oil product.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
Apply that twice a day.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Uh it should help.  @@@ will help you out a lot.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
A lot of times for a scar too, it seems to be like having a lot of problems, it helps healing, helps it really to stay like stay healthy so.

PATIENT X113
Yeah that's kind of been a small concern.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
You know.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Your blood pressure is a little bit low today.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Is that normal for you?

PATIENT X113
Yep.

DOCTOR X113
Okay, sounds good.  And otherwise um.  Like I told you before your platelets all looked fine.  The rest of your electrolytes back in December when we looked at them all looked fine.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
Um I don't know if there's a whole lot more to talk about outside of having getting down to uh making sure that you're as healthy as you can be and it looks like you're doing pretty good right now.

PATIENT X113
Yeah I think I you now.  Beside the allergies I feel fine.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
You know.

DOCTOR X113
Alright.  Let's see you had a colonoscopy back in 2007.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
Make this look a little prettier um and they didn't find anything?

PATIENT X113
As far as I know.  I never heard anything.

DOCTOR X113
No polyps or anything.  @@@.  It showed they found some hemorrhoids but.

PATIENT X113
Oh.

DOCTOR X113
But that's nothing to be concerned about obviously okay.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
Alright.

PATIENT X113
That turned out to be expensive if that's all that fine; in some ways I could have told them there were hemorrhoids.

DOCTOR X113
Have you ever had your prostate levels checked?

PATIENT X113
Uh no.

DOCTOR X113
Um it is a test that we can do for you.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
So you have had the test before whether you know it or not.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
Uh this we, it's a blood test that uh that we can look to see if there is any elevation in it we can be a little more aggressive to see if there's any prostate cancer.

PATIENT X113
Right.

DOCTOR X113
Your tests have been normal in the past; we don't need to repeat anything.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
If you want to, it's just something that's followed yearly.

PATIENT X113
Uh you're in charge here alright so.

DOCTOR X113
I will tell you to get this so you know, @@@ checking the prostate levels, sometimes it can elevate for no reason whatsoever.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
I'll need you down the road getting a biopsy.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
That has its own complications.

PATIENT X113
Right.

DOCTOR X113
Um but then you don't get the, if we're not checking it you don't get the benefits of early detection so.

PATIENT X113
Hmm.

DOCTOR X113
Uh but no prostate cancer in your family history, I'd take a look either way.  I would say if.

PATIENT X113
You're calling the shots.

DOCTOR X113
If you're the kind of guy that would be really concerned about that, otherwise if uh we want to check it then we can go ahead and check it.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
If you really don't care too much or.

PATIENT X113
Right now I'm not worried about it.

DOCTOR X113
Okay, so we'll hold off on checking it.

PATIENT X113
Alright.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Okay and then cholesterol.  Have you had that checked?

PATIENT X113
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
And it goes up and down I mean.

DOCTOR X113
It looks like you're doing pretty good actually so.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Uh your.

PATIENT X113
Is that something to check?

DOCTOR X113
Your last cholesterol test was back in February.  I think you're probably due for another check.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
As well as the thiamine and the blood sugars, making sure those all look good as well.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
You've never had a problem with those before.

PATIENT X113
No.

DOCTOR X113
So it looks like that would be a problem.  Do you remember when your last tetanus shot was?

PATIENT X113
Um it was a few years back but it was here, it should be on record.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah 2007, good.  Alright.  So I need you to come on here.

PATIENT X113
Whatever you got to do buddy.

DOCTOR X113
Alright um, also you're taking the fluoxetine for depression is that right?

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
How's that going?  Are you having any symptoms?

PATIENT X113
No I'm doing alright.

DOCTOR X113
@@@.

PATIENT X113
Yeah I'm doing okay with it you know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X113
Sounds good.

PATIENT X113
You know.

DOCTOR X113
Um some of the things they ask us to ask you about are about risk factors for sexually transmitted infections um, you're not having any unprotected sex or anything?

PATIENT X113
I'm not having any sex period so.

DOCTOR X113
Oh you're not, alright.  Um and then do you have any tattoos?

PATIENT X113
Yeah I have a tattoo.

DOCTOR X113
Have you ever been checked for hepatitis C before?

PATIENT X113
I don't know, I don't think so.  Uh but actually that's something we probably should look at.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
Cause the last uh partner I had uh she died of Hep C.

DOCTOR X113
Yeah that's been tested; it looks like back in 2007.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
Uh and it was normal.

PATIENT X113
And she died, when did she die, @@@.

DOCTOR X113
Let me see, have you ever had the HIV test done?

PATIENT X113
Yeah, yeah, more than one occasion yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Great well, it appears to me that you're a pretty healthy fellow right now um.  I'd say keep taking that Zyrtec for the allergies and do the moisturizer on your ankle.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
We'll make sure everything else is doing well.  We'll check some blood tests.  I'm assuming you've eaten today?

PATIENT X113
Yes.

DOCTOR X113
So uh when you get a chance to get some fasting blood draw for us, just stop down at the first floor Laboratory.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
Um we'll check your cholesterol, we'll check your electrolytes and check your platelets again to make sure everything looks okay uh and then following that, you've got my clearance for doing whatever you have been doing.

PATIENT X113
Well I want this fixed.

DOCTOR X113
Hop up here.

PATIENT X113
Alright.

DOCTOR X113
@@@.

PATIENT X113
Yeah.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.

PATIENT X113
And what I need, is a little help with a lesion back there.

DOCTOR X113
Okay.  Take a look up here.

PATIENT X113
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X113
Couple deep breaths.  Good, again, good.  Again, good, one more, alright.  Breathe normal.  Deep breathe in and hold it.

PATIENT X113
Okay.

DOCTOR X113
Lift that chest, again deep breath in and hold it.  Great.  It sounds very good.  Now you've never had any chest pain or any trouble breathing?

PATIENT X113
I didn't have any uh chest pains even with my heart attack.

DOCTOR X113
What kind of symptoms were you having then?

PATIENT X113
That was right through here.

DOCTOR X113
You had an arm pain?

PATIENT X113
Oh yeah.  I mean it's like, kind of like you cut it off okay.  You know.  Okay here's what they did oh okay.  This was, okay this was what I received from the VA.

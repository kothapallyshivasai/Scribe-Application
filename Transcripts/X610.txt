DOCTOR X610
In the night?

PATIENT X610
At night right.

DOCTOR X610
Okay.  Do you want.  We can, why don't we increase the doxazosin dose then?

PATIENT X610
Uh if I'm taking it, I'm going to the bathroom a lot.

DOCTOR X610
Okay.

PATIENT X610
Not a lot of beer but a little bit more than I should.

DOCTOR X610
Okay.

PATIENT X610
But nothing else, no drugs, no cigarettes, no nothing like that uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
Well let's increase the dose then.

PATIENT X610
Okay and I think that's the reason why yeah, yeah.  Cause I was gonna mention that if we could increase @@@.  @@@.

DOCTOR X610

PATIENT X610
Which one are those?

DOCTOR X610
Of the doxazosin.

PATIENT X610
Uh yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
So essentially what I'm doing is doubling the dose.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
So um right now you're taking half a tablet.

PATIENT X610
Taking half right.

DOCTOR X610
Okay why don't you start taking a full tablet?

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
Okay.  I went ahead and put a new order in here though cause that means you'll run out of it before your refill is due.

PATIENT X610
Okay, right.

DOCTOR X610
So I went ahead and changed the order in the computer okay.

PATIENT X610
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X610
So let's see if that helps a little bit.

PATIENT X610
Okay, alrighty.

DOCTOR X610
Are you seen in the GU Clinic here?  It doesn't look like you are.  Well why don't we try that change.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
If that change doesn't work then we'll send you to the urinary doctors.

PATIENT X610
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X610
They're the specialists.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
Cause they have access to more medicines and they can order more stuff than us.

PATIENT X610
Okay, so instead of just taking a half at night.

DOCTOR X610
Take a whole tablet.

PATIENT X610
I take a full tablet okay.

DOCTOR X610
Yeah, yeah and then when your, when you run out then the next prescription will reflect the whole tablet.

PATIENT X610
Oh okay, alrighty.

DOCTOR X610
Um let's see what else.  I think that's everything for you.  So you had a colonoscopy in 2002 so we'll need to repeat that next year.

PATIENT X610
Okay, alright, okay.

DOCTOR X610
Um and you say you're not using, you're not taking the ibuprofen you have?

PATIENT X610
@@@.

DOCTOR X610
Oh that's good, okay.  I think that's everything unless there's anything you need.

PATIENT X610
No you've really explained everything quite well for me and I appreciate it.

DOCTOR X610
No, right, good and your sinuses are good and everything?

PATIENT X610
They're @@@.

DOCTOR X610
Okay good, alright.  Let me go run this by my attending okay.

PATIENT X610
Okay, alright, okay, thank you.

DOCTOR X610
Alright, no problem.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:17  DOCTOR IN:  54:38)

DOCTOR X610
Alright.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
Just one little thing um.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
So for the nausea that you're having.

PATIENT X610
Right.

DOCTOR X610
You're telling me you are having it every morning right?

PATIENT X610
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
And you're taking the @@@ in the morning.

PATIENT X610
Right uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
And it usually goes away.

PATIENT X610
Right uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
So since it's only in the morning or you notice it in the morning when you wake up.

PATIENT X610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
It might be @@@ cause it's gone down @@@.

PATIENT X610
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X610
Up a little bit.

PATIENT X610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
So I know you're taking the lansoprazole twice a day already.

PATIENT X610
Right, right.

DOCTOR X610
And I know they told you to do ranitidine only if you need it.

PATIENT X610
Right.

DOCTOR X610
But perhaps you should try, keep taking the lansoprazole twice a day.

PATIENT X610
Right okay.

DOCTOR X610
And take the ranitidine right before you go to bed every night.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
Regardless of whether or not you feel the reflux cause sometimes you don't feel the reflux pain but you actually do have reflux so.

PATIENT X610
Oh.

DOCTOR X610
It may be the reason you have nausea in the morning, who knows.

PATIENT X610
Oh okay right, okay.

DOCTOR X610
We'll see if that works.

PATIENT X610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
Um if you, you know if you keep having symptoms and the reflux doesn't get better there's always a surgical option.  I don't know if anyone's talked to you about that or maybe you just didn't want it or anything cause you've got that hernia.

PATIENT X610
Right, right.

DOCTOR X610
Cause you do have the reflux because of the hernia.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
Some people have reflux just because they do and we don't know why.

PATIENT X610
Right.

DOCTOR X610
You actually have a reason to have reflux.

PATIENT X610
Right okay.

DOCTOR X610
So we'll try that.  Try doing it at night, the ranitidine.  Take it at night even if you don't think you do.

PATIENT X610
Even okay.

DOCTOR X610
Okay.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
And then um.

PATIENT X610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
And then we'll see how it goes and we can follow up with the stomach doctors, the GI doctors.

PATIENT X610
Right okay.

DOCTOR X610
In a couple months.

PATIENT X610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X610
Then you can let them know how you're doing and.

PATIENT X610
Okay.

DOCTOR X610
Cause they would be the ones who say you know you should do the surgery, now they won't do the surgery.

PATIENT X610
Right.

DOCTOR X610
But they can make a suggestion as to whether you need it.

PATIENT X610
Okay right.

DOCTOR X610
Okay.

PATIENT X610
So the lansoprazole take two in the morning, two in the evening and also, whether I think I need it or not, to take the ranitidine.

DOCTOR X610
Yes.

PATIENT X610
I will do that.

DOCTOR X610

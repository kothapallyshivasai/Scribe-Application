DOCTOR X505
How you today?

PATIENT X505
Oh, my heels, my knee.

DOCTOR X505
What's going on?

PATIENT X505
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
Somebody said this might be arthritis.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.

PATIENT X505
@@@.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
My heel now when I get up in the morning for the last, I'd say a month.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
When I wake up in the morning my heels are bothering me.

DOCTOR X505
Your heels?

PATIENT X505
Yeah.

DOCTOR X505
Which one the right heel?

PATIENT X505
Right heel.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.

PATIENT X505
And then after I walk around a while.

DOCTOR X505
It goes away.

PATIENT X505
It feels better.

DOCTOR X505
You may have a spur down there.

PATIENT X505
That's what they were saying.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.

PATIENT X505
What is a spur?

DOCTOR X505
So a spur is basically an extra bone growth um.  It could have been arthritis.  You know when you gat, what happens with arthritis is you get inflammation.

PATIENT X505
Alright.

DOCTOR X505
And the bones sort of react to that inflammation with @@@ kind of growths and we get spurs.  So basically it's like extra bone growth in there.

PATIENT X505
Like that.

DOCTOR X505
Um does it hurt when you push on the heel?

PATIENT X505
No I mean, like I said after I get up.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
Like the first time I.

DOCTOR X505
Sure.

PATIENT X505
Actually @@@ have to get up three or four times a night.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
Okay I haven't been asleep for about three or four hours.

DOCTOR X505
Right.

PATIENT X505
The first time I get up.

DOCTOR X505
You're okay in that heel.

PATIENT X505
Yeah if I got to get up I go again but after that it @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.

PATIENT X505
And you know I know its there.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.

PATIENT X505
But it's not as severe as it is when I first get up.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.  Um we'll take a look at it and see.  Um now you saw the GI doctors and they said everything was okay um from your stomach, you know from the perspective of your stomach.  No more black stools or anything?  Okay.  Um and then now I understand that you essentially didn't want to take the Coumadin?

PATIENT X505
Uh that's what I had when I you know I got sick you know.

DOCTOR X505
Right.

PATIENT X505
Before that blood and everything.

DOCTOR X505
Right, right.

PATIENT X505
Uh.

DOCTOR X505
Well the reason you bled is because you had an ulcer.

PATIENT X505
I didn't know that.

DOCTOR X505
You know so the blood thinner has made it worse because you had the ulcer and then you, because you had blood thinners it made the bleeding worse.

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
Uh the only thing concerned about @@@ is you that arrhythmia you have, that atrial fibrillation that A fib.

PATIENT X505
Yeah.

DOCTOR X505
You know where your heart doesn't go regular.

PATIENT X505
Right.

DOCTOR X505
So you're at increased risk for developing blood clots because of that irregular rhythm okay.  So if you, I mean aspirin helps some but not as much as the Coumadin does and so what happens is if you're not on the Coumadin you're at a higher risk of developing blood clots cause your heart doesn't pump like a regular heart.

PATIENT X505
Right.

DOCTOR X505
Sometimes it does this sort of shaky thing and that can set you up for blood clots and the thing with that is that it can increase your risks of having a stroke because the blood clots can go from your heart and shoot up into your brain you know cause that's why we recommend that you be on Coumadin.  We stopped the Coumadin when you had your bleeding episode because you were actively bleeding.  You know you had that ulcer but now that the ulcer has healed uh you could go back on Coumadin.  The decision is up to you but I want you to understand what the risks and benefits are.

PATIENT X505
Okay and um DOCTOR she gave me what, I was on 5 mg.

DOCTOR X505
Right.

PATIENT X505
I think they wanted me to go to 5 1/2.

DOCTOR X505
Right.

PATIENT X505
So that's when I started having problems.

DOCTOR X505
I mean what we, cause when they adjust the doses it's based on the blood tests and we want your level, that INR level, we want it between 2 and 3 so they adjust the dose based on the levels.  But I want you to understand that the Coumadin doesn't cause the bleeding, it's the ulcer that caused the bleeding, it's just that the Coumadin made it worse because you were on a blood thinner.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
You know so unless you have an ulcer or something like an ulcer you know the Coumadin should not cause you to bleed like that.  It's just that you had an ulcer you know.  Uh you know the decision's up to you but.

PATIENT X505
Oh I, if you recommend it I'll.

DOCTOR X505
I would recommend it because I think you're a pretty functional guy and you're 70 years old and you're annual risk of having a stroke with you have that atrial fibrillation is 2% okay.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
So you know I think, now you can see, you know its lots of things.  If you start the Coumadin, if you start @@@ we got to figure out why you know.

PATIENT X505
Right.

DOCTOR X505
Or if you're on 3 and we'll stop it you know and then but you did have this one episode, we treated it.  We treated the ulcer um so the ulcer is healed and so now we can see if you know.

PATIENT X505
Like I say, if you recommend it I can go along with it as far as the you know.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.

PATIENT X505
I want to protect my health you know.

DOCTOR X505
Right you know I think it's still just one small thing you know.

PATIENT X505
Yeah I know, I know.

DOCTOR X505
@@@.

PATIENT X505
@@@.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah oh yeah.

PATIENT X505
Yeah my brother had a stroke and my father had a stroke so you know.

DOCTOR X505
And do have some limited mobility from it?

PATIENT X505
Well my brother, well my father passed and my brother yeah he's @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Right, you know so that's why we you know sort of push for it.

PATIENT X505
Yeah you know that's what I'm saying I.

DOCTOR X505
And you know we'll see if things, if things um, your blood level got a lot better.  They checked your blood in March and your blood levels were significantly better than they were you know a few months ago so um.  Let me see here.  Are you still taking the iron or did you stop taking the iron?

PATIENT X505
No I stopped taking the iron.

DOCTOR X505
Okay, alright.  Your cholesterol was checked in December and your cholesterol looked good.  When did you stop the iron?

PATIENT X505
Uh it's been like 30 days.  I had a 30 day supply and I used them up and @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X505
Because you said that I had another blood test.

DOCTOR X505
Right, right.

PATIENT X505
@@@.

DOCTOR X505
Um okay.  And your blood pressure looks good today and your diabetes looked good the last time we checked it.  Still like to check it you know before our next visit when you come back in three months.  We should probably check it before then, the diabetes, just to make sure its still under control.

PATIENT X505
Me or you?

DOCTOR X505
You.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.

PATIENT X505
I can do that.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah um and then did you see the eye doctor this year?

PATIENT X505
Yeah I @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Oh okay, @@@ clinic okay.

PATIENT X505
@@@.

DOCTOR X505
Oh okay.

PATIENT X505
I go there @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Okay so have you been gaining weight?

PATIENT X505
Yeah I was wondering if can't be some of the medicine I'm taking.  Cause my appetite is @@@ for some reason.

DOCTOR X505
Well part of it may be, part of it, you know you have been gaining some weight over the past year and a half here.

PATIENT X505
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X505
Part of it may be that if you have your diabetes under better control, you know normally if your sugar is too high you can pee out the sugar.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
So when you get, you take your medicines and you get your diabetes under control you actually absorb the sugar in your body and then that can make you gain weight.  But if you have your diabetes under good control, which you do and you seem that you do, you actually can gain weight cause the way you help that is you have to exercise more and likely eat more you know.

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
But how have your @@@ been?

PATIENT X505
Well just uh.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
My appetite, I don't know somebody will feed me @@@.  I know but lately it's like uh and I told my wife, she's small.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
But she's been trying to gain weight.

DOCTOR X505
Oh.

PATIENT X505
And she's having to cook a lot of food and I don't like to waste food you know she's giving it to the dog and he's getting bigger and I'm getting bigger.

DOCTOR X505
Well you've got to, clearly your wife should take a bigger portion and you need to take a smaller portion.  Um okay.  Uh I mean you know we also have the MOVE Program here.  I don't know if you've been offered that before.

PATIENT X505
Yeah.  Actually I have a lot to do all day.  Like I said my wife she's been sick.

DOCTOR X505
@@@ going on?

PATIENT X505
She's got cancer.

DOCTOR X505
Oh that's why she's losing all this weight.

PATIENT X505
Right yeah.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.  Breast cancer or?

PATIENT X505
No, no, she's got a lung cancer.

DOCTOR X505
Lung cancer.

PATIENT X505
She's a big smoker.

DOCTOR X505
Oh I see okay, alright.  So that's why she's trying to gain weight and eat a lot.

PATIENT X505
Yeah she feels like, but she can't walk now.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
She lost @@@.

DOCTOR X505
I see uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
She can't walk so I have to get her up you know.

DOCTOR X505
Sure, sure.

PATIENT X505
Do what I can do you know.  She's only @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.  I think then what we need to work on to start with is the diet at least because that's when you can control, you know you can control your portions at least.

PATIENT X505
Yeah.

DOCTOR X505
You know.  Um let me ask you, what uh, you were saying that you have to get up three or four times a night to go to the bathroom, the prostate is still bothering you?

PATIENT X505
See but I drink a lot of fluid like uh, Crystal Light you know I drink a gallon.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
Of water and put Crystal Light in it and @@@ mostly fluid.  I eat chocolate every now and then.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.  I know that we tried that one prostate medicine but it made you a little bit dizzy.

PATIENT X505
I think I was taking it twice, now I only take it once.

DOCTOR X505
You're still taking the prostate medicine?

PATIENT X505
Yeah I take it.

DOCTOR X505
You take it once, okay you're taking it.

PATIENT X505
I take it once at night.

DOCTOR X505
But it hasn't really helped that much?  Has it helped at all?

PATIENT X505
Well like I said you know, cause you know the water I take in, you know I don't have no problems urinating and stuff like that you know.  It doesn't bother me; it's just that now I held, I had to go to the washroom when I first came over here.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.

PATIENT X505
And I hold it just because I might have to go to the you know.

DOCTOR X505
Right catch stuff right.

PATIENT X505
@@@.  It doesn't bother me, it just the fact that I know that I'm gonna have to get up two or three times a night.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.

PATIENT X505
That's when I'm drinking more you know like Crystal Light.

DOCTOR X505
Alright so if you don't drink the water you don't have to get up?

PATIENT X505
Depending on what I drink.  If I take in like a half a cup like I say so I don't have to get up @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Okay, well you know, if there is anything else, if you don't drink anything like too much a couple hours before you go to bed.

PATIENT X505
Yeah.

DOCTOR X505
And that will probably let you get a better night's sleep because you don't have to get up three or four times a night.

PATIENT X505
Yeah, I had an appetite for water and so.

DOCTOR X505
Oh yeah that's good.  Drinking water is good, it helps your diabetes.  It helps a lot of different things.

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
But maybe just cutting back late at night before you go to bed.

PATIENT X505
Right, right.

DOCTOR X505
You know um and then how, any problems with your hernia?

PATIENT X505
No that's still the same you know.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.

PATIENT X505
I don't, you know.  As long as I @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Okay, alright.  So why don't you take a look, I'm going to take a look.  Why don't you take off your shoes, I'll be back in a few minutes, we'll take a look at it okay.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
And which knee is it that's bothering you?

PATIENT X505
Uh both, this right here.

DOCTOR X505
Right in here?

PATIENT X505
But this one is worse.

DOCTOR X505
Okay can you kick in and kick out for me?

PATIENT X505
I can do all that.  But it @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
I got a @@@.  This one hurts too at night.

DOCTOR X505
Go in and out for me.

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
See you have a little bit of what we call crepitus there which may just signal arthritis.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
What is, has this been going on for a while or is it kind of getting worse?

PATIENT X505
Well like I said this just started.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X505
In a month.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.

PATIENT X505
And this one started @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.

PATIENT X505
You know that @@@ all that stuff @@@.  So then lately this one started too, giving me trouble too so @@@.

DOCTOR X505
I wonder if you have enough arch support in your shoes.

PATIENT X505
I got those @@@ shoes.  @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.  I wonder if maybe, let me talk to DOCTOR cause maybe we could send you to Podiatry to see if you can get some good inserts.

PATIENT X505
I got those Dr. Scholl's you know.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.  But they can give you ones that will actually fit for your foot.

PATIENT X505
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
Uh that might be something that might be helpful.  Let me, because that might help.

PATIENT X505
@@@.

DOCTOR X505
@@@.

PATIENT X505
@@@.  Right there.

DOCTOR X505
Oh here?

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
When I push there does it hurt?

PATIENT X505
Yeah it hurt but I just you know.

DOCTOR X505
That's where it is, so that's where it hurts.

PATIENT X505
Right yeah, uh-huh.  I'd say too like when you drive when your foot stays like this all the time, I @@@.

DOCTOR X505
Yeah no that could be it too, if you're pushing on the nerve there.

PATIENT X505
You know and driving.

DOCTOR X505
How is it when you sleep, how are you positioned?  What is your positioned like?  Cause you @@@ if it's only happening mostly when you wake up in the morning if your foot is being positioned at night in a way that is pushing on a nerve or something.  Something to check into.

PATIENT X505
@@@.

DOCTOR X505
You can probably you know you can put a pillow underneath your leg at night just to see what happens.

PATIENT X505
Yeah.

DOCTOR X505
Keep it from like cushioning it and even that might help and you know we have nerves and veins and stuff everywhere in our body.  There may be a nerve there that's being pushed on.

PATIENT X505
@@@ that's what I'm saying I thought maybe from me driving all these years from my foot being like that.

DOCTOR X505
That's possible.

PATIENT X505
@@@.

DOCTOR X505
It's possible.  The other thing is that when you've got arthritis in the knee it can also affect the feet.

PATIENT X505
Really.

DOCTOR X505
It's not arthritis in your feet but it can also kind of mess with the way you walk.

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
And the way you know because you know you don't feel comfortable with your knees.  Let's say this knee was bothering you more and then you're putting more pressure on the right foot because the left knee is bothering you you know.

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
Uh because there are lots of different things that can cause it.  I think one thing that, let me check @@@ I think one thing that might help is having good arch supports.

PATIENT X505
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X505
Under your feet and that might help them with the support and then you put a pillow under your heel at night and see if that helps when you get up in the morning okay.  Just sit up here.  I think your heart is regular.  So right now you're not in that atrial fibrillation rhythm.  Okay let me go talk to the boss and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:06  DOCTOR IN:  35:43)

DOCTOR X505
Alright sir.  I think, um I'm going to refer you to a podiatrist to see if they feel that you need any @@@ insert for your shoes um and ask them to just take a look at your foot and see if they could find any cause of the pain that you're having there okay.

PATIENT X505
When today?

DOCTOR X505
No I'm gonna give you a referral today.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.  Um and then the last thing is in terms of restarting the Coumadin.  This is something that we want to monitor you closely when we restart it because we don't want what happened last time to happen again you know.  So what um you're gonna be following, I know you used to come and follow with the pharmacist, right with DOCTOR.

PATIENT X505
Right.

DOCTOR X505
So we're gonna have you follow with them um.  The other thing is that we probably, I'm going to give you a set of stool cards um and after you've been on the Coumadin for a couple weeks I want you to send in your stool in on the card okay.  So I just want to make sure that there's no further blood in the stool after you've been on the Coumadin.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
Okay.  Um and that way we can be sure that it's safe for you to be on the Coumadin.  You know that well with benefit kind of thing here okay.  Alright just give me one second here.  And I'm going to put some labs in for three months from now okay.  So or well 2 1/2 months from now.  So if you could come in and get your blood tested maybe a week before you come for your appointment.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
Then we'll have all the labs when you come back in okay.

PATIENT X505
And I'm gonna need to you know update all my medicines.

DOCTOR X505
Right okay what do you need?  Uh do you know which meds you.

PATIENT X505
Well I don't know, you know some of them may have, you know @@@ the last time I get them.

DOCTOR X505
Uh-huh.  Sure.

PATIENT X505
You I want to make sure that I have them.

DOCTOR X505
That you have enough.

PATIENT X505

PATIENT X505

DOCTOR X505
Okay.  Looking good.  You'll come back and see us, so I'm graduating come July 1st, so I don't think I'm gonna be seeing you anymore in this clinic.

PATIENT X505

DOCTOR X505
Um I'm working in the Diabetes Clinic upstairs starting in July um.  Let's see if there's anything here.  So they'll call you about the Coumadin Clinic.

PATIENT X505
Okay.

DOCTOR X505
So just to kind of get in touch with you regarding setting that up uh and let me see if we've got those cards.  Okay let me walk out with you sir.  I'm gonna give you this to make your appointment.  Your medicines were renewed.  Um and you're gonna get some labs @@@.  I still need to get you some stool cards that you take @@@.  So @@@.  Yeah they're gonna mail the appointment to you.

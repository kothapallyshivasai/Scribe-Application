PATIENT X121
Yes.

DOCTOR X121

PATIENT X121
Okay.

So it's been a long time.  Come on in here.

PATIENT X121
Do you have some gear for me?

DOCTOR X121
You gotta bear with us here.  I'm having a @@@.

PATIENT X121
@@@.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah, well how's things been going?

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
And you've been through quite a bit since I saw you last.

PATIENT X121
Oh, last July I had surgery on my chin here to cut out a big chunk, cancer yeah.

DOCTOR X121
I heard all about that.

PATIENT X121
I spent three or four days here. 

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.  And who were you bringing that problem up to?

PATIENT X121
Twice I had surgery, December 1st.

DOCTOR X121
Did they have to go back and do margins?

PATIENT X121
I had the original and then in July was the big one.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.  So uh how old are you now?

PATIENT X121
73.

DOCTOR X121
Hmm.  Alright and if I remember right I know about the floor of mouth cancer, you have coronary disease, like coronary artery disease if I remember right.

PATIENT X121
Uh.  @@@ something huh.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.  Alright.  Did they give you the list of your pills?

PATIENT X121
Uh, you diagnosed me with uh.

DOCTOR X121
When you came in though, did they give a list?

PATIENT X121
High blood sugar.

DOCTOR X121
When you came in were they able to give you uh the list of your medicines?

PATIENT X121
No.

DOCTOR X121
Like they do normally when you check in?

PATIENT X121
No, no, not this time.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
Just this thing here, new directives or something.

DOCTOR X121
Advanced directives.

PATIENT X121
Yeah.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.

PATIENT X121
Yeah usually they give you a sheet with your medications.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah all the VA medicines.

PATIENT X121
Yeah I take 81 mg aspirin.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
Uh metoprolol, metoprolol.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
Simvastatin.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
And uh glipizide.  That I think was prescribed for the high blood sugar, diabetes.

DOCTOR X121
Exactly.  So you're gonna be due for some labs.

PATIENT X121
Well uh I went to that class, when was that, sometime last May, the Diabetes Class.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
It was like three or four hours here.  

DOCTOR X121
Yes.

PATIENT X121
And uh they give me one of those glucose meters and.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
Well I get.

DOCTOR X121
Have you been checking your sugars?

PATIENT X121
This past week I ran out of the strips and before that.

DOCTOR X121
You need more?

PATIENT X121
Uh yeah.  Yeah I called to refill the script and they said it was beyond expiration.  That was just a sampling on there from the past week the dates.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.

PATIENT X121
Sunday I've run out but all the other things are on there I guess in the memory.  It goes back for the last May or whatever.  We got a time and a date on there.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.  So they're probably a little higher than we would like.  You know there are quite a few that are in the 200s.

PATIENT X121
Well from what I remember they said if it's over 500 to call the doctor right away or if it's below 100.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.  Well.

PATIENT X121
If it's somewhere in between 200 and right.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah right.  Um okay, this says you're on @@@.  And when was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

PATIENT X121
About probably a year ago.

DOCTOR X121
So we'll get you back in to get a look at that.  We'll recheck your cholesterol.  Uh we'll check, we'll recall your hemoglobin A1c which gives us an idea of more uh, an average of what your blood sugar has been.

PATIENT X121
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X121
Rather than just what it is at that moment.

PATIENT X121
Oh okay yeah.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X121
Cause it changes constantly, if you have something to eat it's probably different in ten minutes.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah, this gives us an average.

PATIENT X121
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X121
Over the past about 90 days.

PATIENT X121
Huh okay.

DOCTOR X121
Um okay.  And then your blood pressure was up today huh?  Has it been up?

PATIENT X121
The what?

DOCTOR X121
Your blood pressure.

PATIENT X121
Oh it was just 158.

DOCTOR X121
Do you check it at home and outside the hospital?

PATIENT X121
When I check it at home, maybe three, four days ago, it was 136/80.

DOCTOR X121
Do you take any water pills, anything besides the metoprolol?

PATIENT X121
Uh.

DOCTOR X121
Hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X121
That one I got a rash from.

DOCTOR X121
Oh that's right.

PATIENT X121
Uh I'm taking something else, what is it?

DOCTOR X121
Furosemide, Lasix, lisinopril?

PATIENT X121
No simvastatin what is that for?

DOCTOR X121
That's cholesterol.

PATIENT X121
Cholesterol.

DOCTOR X121
So you just take four pills a day?

PATIENT X121
Four yeah.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.  Alright, okay.  

PATIENT X121
Oh furosemide, that's a water pill.

DOCTOR X121
You take furosemide?

PATIENT X121
Yeah in the morning.

DOCTOR X121
@@@.

PATIENT X121
Yeah that's right.  I had them separated.  I'm picturing in my mind what I had on the shelf.

DOCTOR X121
That's alright, thanks for bearing with us here.  It's just a cold.  Can you sit up here?

PATIENT X121
Sure.

DOCTOR X121
I read all your chart on Friday and that was one thing I'm trying to think back and remember everything.  I can't refresh my memory.  I'm kind of helpless without the computer now until every thing’s set, but that's the way it is.

PATIENT X121
Huh.

DOCTOR X121
I would like to check that blood pressure again.

PATIENT X121
You want me to take the shirt off?

DOCTOR X121
Uh yeah that's not a bad idea, probably be a little easier.  So how's your life?

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
Any major problems or concerns?

PATIENT X121
Uh none, no.

DOCTOR X121
Oh yeah okay.  Are you a drinker or a smoker?

PATIENT X121
I almost quit drinking.  You know I'll go see a friend of mine once in a while at the bar when they needed to make wooden signs in their.

DOCTOR X121
No that's alright.

PATIENT X121
Or sports figurines.

DOCTOR X121
Right.

PATIENT X121
I'll have a couple beers but other than that no.  But smoking I quit last April, April 10th a year ago.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.  Excellent.  

PATIENT X121
And I'll get a class each year in April.

DOCTOR X121
And you managed to stay quit.

PATIENT X121
Yeah, no.

DOCTOR X121
Good, very good.

PATIENT X121
I just threw a pack of cigarettes I had sitting there by the television, they were just sitting there I never touched them.

DOCTOR X121
That's great.  That's great.  Feeling okay, energy's okay?

PATIENT X121
Yeah.  I'm tired all the time since that surgery, sleepy tired you know.  

DOCTOR X121
Yeah it's definitely up a little bit, the 150s uh over 90 uh.

PATIENT X121
It was just 158/80.

DOCTOR X121
Did you take your medicine today?

PATIENT X121
Uh, no I take them at nighttime.

DOCTOR X121
Okay you take it all just once a day?

PATIENT X121
The only thing I take in the morning is the furosemide.

DOCTOR X121
Did you take that today?

PATIENT X121
Yeah in the morning.

DOCTOR X121
Okay just relax.  Big breath.  Any chest pain?

PATIENT X121
None.

DOCTOR X121
Are you staying active?

PATIENT X121
Yeah.

DOCTOR X121
Any blood in the stool?

PATIENT X121
No.

DOCTOR X121
Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X121
No.

DOCTOR X121
Just look right here.

PATIENT X121
Uh just fatty cysts they call them.

DOCTOR X121
(A person came to the door).

PATIENT X121
Emergency generator.  Power.

DOCTOR X121
Okay, any swelling down here?

PATIENT X121
A little bit at the top of the sock line, usually gets a little swell.  But these are new socks.  Usually with the older socks I wear I don't get nothing.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
It's from the elastic.

DOCTOR X121
Okay can you @@@.  Alright.  How's your breathing?

PATIENT X121
Fine.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.  How much uh you know activity, I mean could you walk like a mile or something?

PATIENT X121
Yeah.

DOCTOR X121
You could?

PATIENT X121
Yeah 10-12 years that I could walk from here 25 feet and I'd have pains.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
My jaw would ache, my arms would ache.  You know that's from the veins or something tightening up right.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
But that was 10-12 years ago and they tried everything.

DOCTOR X121
And they wanted to do the bypass on you.

PATIENT X121
Yeah.

DOCTOR X121
But you didn't want it.

PATIENT X121
No.

DOCTOR X121
And what happened.

PATIENT X121
But they kept giving me medications and I got rid of the nitrates and I didn't need that and then it just went away.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.

PATIENT X121
You know.  It couldn't have been from quitting smoking cause that's just the past year.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
Ten years ago I was smoking a pack and a half to two packs a day.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.  Hmm.

PATIENT X121
But now a year has passed.  I don't know what it was that I was taking or what I'm taking now.  I could walk and walk and walk and not have any you know pains like I had.

DOCTOR X121
Alright, let's see if I can find you here.  So we've got you on Toprol XL, baby aspirin, simvastatin.  Have you ever been on a medicine called lisinopril?

PATIENT X121
Not that I remember.

DOCTOR X121
When did you quit smoking exactly?

PATIENT X121
A year ago, April 10th.

DOCTOR X121
April 10th.  Alright.  Now let's take a look at your pills here.

PATIENT X121
I don't know if it's a side effect.  I'm getting like little sores on the back of my head that seem to itch.  If I scratch them they'll start bleeding like crazy yeah.

DOCTOR X121
I'll take a look.

PATIENT X121
That I think started when I started glipizide.  I'm not sure but.

DOCTOR X121
Hmm I don't know.  I've never heard of anything like that happening.

PATIENT X121
You know little sores.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
And if I scratch on them they'll just start bleeding.

DOCTOR X121
Hmm.  Simvastatin.

PATIENT X121
This I didn't have 15 years ago.

DOCTOR X121
Hmm.

PATIENT X121
I looked at the sheet you get, you know with the medication.  Glipizide promotes weight gain.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah it can do that.

PATIENT X121
Yeah, right there 13 months.

DOCTOR X121
How much weight have you gained?

PATIENT X121
I usually weighed 165-70, now I'm at 181, well with clothes and everything it's 186 just now they weighed me.  But last week I was 180-181.

DOCTOR X121
We'll get you some more test strips.  Do you think you could get your blood drawn any time soon?

PATIENT X121
I could stop after here.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.

PATIENT X121
If the Lab is still open.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah they should be open.  How much have you had to eat today?

PATIENT X121
Oh, when I was here I had a large coffee and a bag of cookies for lunch you know.

DOCTOR X121
You know we may have you.

PATIENT X121
This morning I had cereal.

DOCTOR X121
We may have you come back when you haven't had so much to eat.

PATIENT X121
Okay fast.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah and then I'm going to talk with my boss back there but.

PATIENT X121
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X121
We may want to uh try you on a pill called lisinopril uh and it can help with the blood pressure and the kidneys.  Probably a good pill for you to be taking uh, you know you've had some kind of, some kidney disease that you've had for a long time.

PATIENT X121
Uh the last appointment I had, what was it, oh Urology.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
The 25th or something like that, it was a couple weeks ago.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
And before that I had an ultrasound.

DOCTOR X121
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X121
And they checked you know how much urine, they had to check how much urine I had in the morning, at night and you know @@@ and they said the kidneys, there's nothing wrong with the kidneys.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah I just mean like your kidney function and like we call or we measure with this thing called creatinine which normal is 1 and you're more like around 2.

PATIENT X121
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X121
Uh and it's been that way for quite a while and even back uh three years ago, even back in 2002 it was 1.8 which is about what it is now.

PATIENT X121
Yeah.

DOCTOR X121
Um it still is, for people that have kidney disease and high blood pressure, heart disease, it kind of helps with all of that stuff.

PATIENT X121
Oh uh-huh.

DOCTOR X121
Um so it's something that I'm probably going to talk with my boss back there.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
But it's probably something that you should be taking okay.

PATIENT X121
Okay, I'll try it.

DOCTOR X121
Um let me go talk to one of my bosses back there.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
And I will be right back in.

PATIENT X121
You don't need this anyway.

DOCTOR X121
No I don't need that anymore.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT 35:34  DOCTOR IN:  43:31)

DOCTOR X121
Alright.  So I was going through things with one of my supervisors back there and she definitely agrees that this medicine lisinopril is something that you should be on.

PATIENT X121
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X121
Uh it's for blood pressure but it also is to help the kidneys and things like that.  Okay.  Just take it once a day.  You should take it whenever you take your metoprolol and whatever else.

PATIENT X121
Yeah I take them in the evening when I go to bed.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah that's fine, you can keep doing that.

PATIENT X121
Just the water pill I take in the morning.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.  And it's been a while since we checked cholesterol and all that good stuff so we'll just have you come back um.  What we would like to do is, I don't know if you're going to get your new medicine today or if you'll wait and have it mailed to you.

PATIENT X121
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X121
But about five days or so after you've been taking that pill then come in and have all this blood work done.  That way we can make sure it's agreeing with your kidneys.

PATIENT X121
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X121
Okay.

PATIENT X121
Sure.

DOCTOR X121
Alright.  

PATIENT X121
Do I still take the glucose readings?

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.  I ordered the strips.  Yeah I reordered the strips.

PATIENT X121
That expired.

DOCTOR X121
Right, right, I renewed those.

PATIENT X121
Okay.  Those I'll get in the mail?

DOCTOR X121
Yep.

PATIENT X121
Okay, good enough.

DOCTOR X121
Alright.  I would like to see you back in about three months.  I don't want to wait a year this time if that's okay.  That's a little too long.  I'm guessing you may have had a cancelled appointment, I had to cancel or something in there cause usually uh we don't want to wait quite that long.  Maybe it was like all the surgery and something uh I had to do is why you cancelled.  Alright.  

PATIENT X121
Yeah now when I had surgery last July for the cancer I remember the nurses telling me that they gave me insulin for high blood sugar.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.  We do that in the hospital.

PATIENT X121
Yeah I remember her saying that you know.  I spent like three days or maybe four days here and there was no follow up after that.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah it would've been nice if they would've sent you back to see me.

PATIENT X121
From July so that's 7, 9 months ago.

DOCTOR X121
Okay well you've been hanging in there pretty good so.  Uh this is for you to take to check out.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
I ordered that new pill; you can either go down to the Pharmacy and wait.  I don't know if you've been down there.

PATIENT X121
Yes, yeah I've been there.

DOCTOR X121
Sometimes it takes a while.

PATIENT X121
Half hour.

DOCTOR X121
Yeah.

PATIENT X121
Usually a half hour.

DOCTOR X121
You can get it now um.  If you get it now then you can start taking it even tonight and just when you get your blood drawn be sure you've taken that pill for about 3-5 days.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
And then come in and we'll check the diabetes and the kidneys and just check everything.

PATIENT X121
Will I get a letter now to come in for the lab?

DOCTOR X121
No.

PATIENT X121
Or.

DOCTOR X121
I've already ordered everything.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
You just have to show up.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
On the first floor.

PATIENT X121
Yeah, yeah I know where it is.

DOCTOR X121
You know tell them who you are and then they'll know what all to do.

PATIENT X121
After taking that medication for about a week?

DOCTOR X121
Yes.

PATIENT X121
Okay, sure.

DOCTOR X121
Because normally when we start that we have to check the kidneys and this way we'll just do it all at once.

PATIENT X121
Okay.

DOCTOR X121
Sound like a plan?

PATIENT X121
Sure.

DOCTOR X121
Alright sir.  I'll let you be on your way.  @@@ with the computer problem here.

PATIENT X121
No problem thank you.

DOCTOR X121
Alright.

PATIENT X121

PATIENT LEAVES 49:22

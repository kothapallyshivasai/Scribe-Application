DOCTOR X459
So it doesn't sound like it's your heart.

PATIENT X459
Yeah they changed my, I don't know if it's muscle @@@ or I was wondering maybe you know they had seen some type of tissues that was in my lungs you know now that's something do I have @@@ maybe that's causing the pain, do I have a tumor?  You know so I'm just wondering what you call it because it just keeps bugging me.  You know they gave me blood cultures and.

DOCTOR X459
Oh.

PATIENT X459
On this arm.

DOCTOR X459
So if you had it yesterday I bet it's a little bit of the nerve that's irritated.

PATIENT X459
Yeah because you know @@@ when I came in when I had the surgery on this right I had lost all function of this arm.

DOCTOR X459
Hmm, this is closer to goal.

PATIENT X459
Alright, now this is bothering.  Kind of like @@@.

DOCTOR X459
Yeah.

PATIENT X459
Sometimes it's like needles and pins all up and down my arm because it's focused.  @@@ any pain, @@@ you know like what I used to do with the type of work I was doing then you know I was trying to @@@.  So the only thing I connect it to you know was maybe the surgery you cause uh after surgery I had a lot of occupational therapy.

DOCTOR X459
@@@.  Yeah.

PATIENT X459
You know rebuild my muscle though cause I had to hold my arm up when I came here before the surgery and like the doctor said okay here you know uh those tests and then they did a probe you know they took blood, they got to check @@@, @@@.

DOCTOR X459

DOCTOR X459
Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

PATIENT X459
Yeah.

DOCTOR X459
Um.

PATIENT X459
So I was required, so I was asking them about you know the tumor cause they seen a growth and they expected oh it was benign then I was wondering could I have cancer which would have affected me.

DOCTOR X459
Your chest x-ray in December was completely normal.

PATIENT X459
Uh-huh.  Guess I know before 2003, because like I had this surgery.

DOCTOR X459

PATIENT X459
Uh-huh.  Okay I'm glad you told me that.

DOCTOR X459
I mean that's what's going on here yeah.

PATIENT X459
Cause I been thinking @@@.

DOCTOR X459
Have you been @@@?

PATIENT X459
Yeah that's what kind of led me to surgery back in 2006 because I had the episode, you know I was doing rehab and construction and so like one time we had to remove you know like we cleaned some stuff from this building so we used some caustic chemicals and I had to put on you know a protective suit and the doctor was saying DOCTOR said maybe you know it had seeped through and affected my renal system cause I had this tumor that popped up you know on my left arm, I couldn't use it.

DOCTOR X459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X459
I broke out in a rash.  For two days I couldn't see my eyes swole shut you know.  So when I came in to see them because it happened the same time I was seeing my regular physician which was DOCTOR then.  You know he rushed me to the Emergency Room and that's when I thought this is why my system is breaking down.

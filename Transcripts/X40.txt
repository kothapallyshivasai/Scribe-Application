And as you can probably see on my chart there.  But it got my uh device says ketones, what does that mean?

PATIENT X40
Right.  I try to split up the calcium and the uh and the magnesium.

DOCTOR X40

Stockings, okay.  Do you want to try those?

PATIENT X40
Uh I had them in the past but my script ran out of course you know.

DOCTOR X40
Okay.

PATIENT X40
It's been over two years apparently since the last time they refilled it.

DOCTOR X40
Did you go through Prosthetics?

PATIENT X40
Yes.  Actually Orthotics, uh they're the ones that.

DOCTOR X40
Do want to have them sent to you?

PATIENT X40
Uh.

DOCTOR X40
In the mail?

PATIENT X40
Yeah you can have them sent to me in the mail.  

DOCTOR X40
Do you know what size you were, was there a special size?

PATIENT X40
Yeah they were uh extra large.

DOCTOR X40
Okay.  

PATIENT X40
And could you get me uh, I don't know how they issue them now.  They used to issue them as two pairs but uh I feel with all the changing I have to do on that maybe four pairs would do for you know.

DOCTOR X40
@@@ let's try to split the middle and do three cause I know how they are on those @@@.

PATIENT X40
Okay.

DOCTOR X40
Let's try three pairs of your size.

PATIENT X40
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X40
Now did you have an appointment with DOCTOR?

PATIENT X40
Right.

DOCTOR X40
Good.  I want you to get you back.

PATIENT X40
She won't be back for another couple of weeks I guess.

DOCTOR X40
Right.  Well hopefully it applies today; things like this on you will come up.

PATIENT X40
Right.

DOCTOR X40
So this is smart that you're here.  I think your leg looks better uh.  Let me take a listen to your lungs and see how you sound.  I'll have you lean forward for me.

PATIENT X40
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X40
Take a big deep breath.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Okay now relax and breathe normally.  Have you had problems breathing at all?

PATIENT X40
Not now.  I had the shortness of breath before @@@.

DOCTOR X40
Yes.  Are you taking the metoprolol every day?

PATIENT X40
Yes.  Everything that's on there that I need to have I'm following the regimen.

DOCTOR X40
Good, I'm just making sure.

PATIENT X40
Yeah.

DOCTOR X40
Okay.  So we got that, got that, got that.  The amlodipine.  Blood pressure looks fairly good today, you're afebrile, okay.  You need some refills.  Okay.  And I don't like your blood sugars where they are but we're gonna get a handle on those okay.

PATIENT X40
Okay.

DOCTOR X40
Alright.  I'm gonna come back, I'm going go @@@ my attending and we're gonna have to go up on the insulin regimen I imagine.

PATIENT X40
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X40
I'm not sure; um I'll be right back.

PATIENT X40
Alrighty.  I'll be right here.

DOCTOR X40
Be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  151:4  DOCTOR IN: 164:42)

DOCTOR X40
Okay.  I'm going over with my attending DOCTOR with regard to the level of your blood sugars; pretty carefully I'll grab that.

PATIENT X40
Okay.

DOCTOR X40
And uh you know I was going to be a little more aggressive.  I tend to agree with him, I think the key for you; we need to take one of them at a time and see what we note.  You that's what really happening and I don't want you to make you keep coming in and out um if we uh don't have to.  So why don't we um, why don't we go to 15 units on the insulin @@@, that's twice a day so your totals will be going up by 10 units right.  Its 5 extra in the morning, 5 extra at night, you follow?  So we want 15 twice a day on the regular insulin, keep the Lantus at 30 and then in four or five days if you're still high, give the Gen Med Clinic a call, say DOCTOR told me four days ago he wanted my blood sugar numbers, can I give them to you and you send them to DOCTOR, then they can write these down in the computer.

PATIENT X40
Okay.

DOCTOR X40
Send me a note, I call you and we can adjust them over the phone.

PATIENT X40
I see okay.

DOCTOR X40
Does that sound good to you?

PATIENT X40
Yes it does.

DOCTOR X40
That's for you.  We're gonna go up to 15.  You're gonna stop at the Lab on the way out.

PATIENT X40
And get my.

DOCTOR X40
And get your blood work done.

PATIENT X40
Blood work done.

DOCTOR X40
And that's all in the computer.

PATIENT X40
Will this also be sufficient for the blood work, yeah I'm gonna have a fasting when I come and see DOCTOR right?

DOCTOR X40
Yeah.  I'm gonna let her, right cause you didn't fast today and she's going to want your cholesterol, but today we've just got to check your kidneys okay.  Cause as I say your kidneys aren't doing so hot.

PATIENT X40
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X40
And with your blood sugar the way it is, so we'll still have you and uh I'm going to change it in the computer.  You'll have to change it at home, @@@.

PATIENT X40
Yes, yes I do.

DOCTOR X40
You load it up, do you got enough?

PATIENT X40
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X40
I want to make sure you've got enough right here so I'm gonna change that, that should be @@@.

PATIENT X40
You might have them send me another vial.

DOCTOR X40
Okay.  And I'm going to put lots of neutrals in here so.

PATIENT X40
Okay.

DOCTOR X40
So there are no issues okay.

PATIENT X40
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X40
And you can finish off the antibiotic and then.

PATIENT X40
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X40
You're good to go my fellow.  Uh and you have your appointment with DOCTOR already.

PATIENT X40
Oh yeah, should be in there.

DOCTOR X40
Take a look.

PATIENT X40
Sometime in the middle of January or February.  I think its January.

DOCTOR X40
So you can give this to them up front um when you check out.

PATIENT X40
Right.

DOCTOR X40
When you check out, we'll need to see if you uh, what the day is.  Your GMC3 DOCTOR.

PATIENT X40
What day was that.

DOCTOR X40
January 29th.

PATIENT X40
Uh February 29th?

DOCTOR X40
January 29th.

PATIENT X40
Oh January 29th.

DOCTOR X40
Have you seen her before?

PATIENT X40
No.

DOCTOR X40
I don't know why you have that appointment um.

PATIENT X40
I think I might of.  I've never heard that name before.

DOCTOR X40
Well, it might have been because they got that when they were trying to get my, before they tried to get my appointment.

PATIENT X40
I see.

DOCTOR X40
So why don't you try to re, so January 29th, DOCTOR, try to reschedule because you have a good relationship with DOCTOR right?

PATIENT X40
Yes.  She's taking real good care of me.

DOCTOR X40
No I can tell.  I can tell.  So why don't you try to get in to see her.

PATIENT X40
Okay.

DOCTOR X40
Next available.  That way you have an appointment and if you do you can get rid of this other appointment.  I think they just did that before they knew I'd see you.  I just added you on today.

PATIENT X40
Okay.

DOCTOR X40
Because I didn't want you to wait that long.

PATIENT X40
Plus they probably didn't know that DOCTOR would be back.

DOCTOR X40
Yes exactly.

PATIENT X40
In the clinic within.

DOCTOR X40
So try to get in.  And now I know, you're always welcome to see me.  I don't want to steal you from her.

PATIENT X40
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X40
So we're just doing this to help you out.

PATIENT X40
Well thank you very much doc.

DOCTOR X40
No you're very welcome.

PATIENT X40

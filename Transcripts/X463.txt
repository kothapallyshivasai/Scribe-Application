PATIENT X463
How are you?  Hello doc.

DOCTOR X463
Hey, I was looking for you.

PATIENT X463
I uh.

DOCTOR X463
How do you do.

PATIENT X463
I'm doing that on Monday, Fridays.

DOCTOR X463
Alright.  Uh we have @@@ comfortable but.  How are you today?

PATIENT X463
Doing okay.

DOCTOR X463
Alright.  Are you here uh for a check-up?

PATIENT X463
You see I got this thing and I don't know what it is down here.  @@@.

DOCTOR X463
You got a little bit of a wart; it looks like it's got infected.

PATIENT X463
I think it's just.

DOCTOR X463
@@@ right for.

PATIENT X463
It started, it's why they burst, you know I put a Band-Aid on, I put some @@@ and put a Band-Aid on.

DOCTOR X463
Yeah that's probably the best thing to do uh I mean there's nothing really you know we can give you here for it other than just advice to keep it clean and dry and you know.

PATIENT X463
I keep it clean.

DOCTOR X463
Avoid like you know getting dirt in it.

PATIENT X463
And that's why I put a Band-Aid on it.

DOCTOR X463
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got to wash it, I could say at least three times a day and keep it clean, good.

PATIENT X463
But I have no more Band-Aids.

DOCTOR X463
Um so as far as a general uh health maintenance stuff I think that uh the blood pressure is probably a little bit on the high side today uh.  Did you have a chance to take your medicines this morning or?

PATIENT X463
I forgot to take it today.

DOCTOR X463
Yeah okay.  Well like do you need a refill on any of them or?

PATIENT X463
Yeah this medicine here, now what's the name.

DOCTOR X463
Right okay.  Do you have enough at home @@@.

PATIENT X463
I have enough you know today but I don't have enough till the next time I @@@.

DOCTOR X463
Okay, okay.  Well the issues is that we think that your uh blood pressure is actually dangerously high, uh at which point it seems as though based on your last blood work a year ago you have, uh the problem is is when people have kind of longstanding high blood pressures they uh, it can actually, it starts to damage other organs because the pressure's so high and the first organ damaged is usually the kidney.  Um based on your blood work which was April 14, 2009, um your kidney function is less than 50%.  So that's fine, I mean people can live with 50% of their kidneys you know no problem but if it continues to decline and we don't get your blood pressure under control and just @@@ today, once you get to about 10% that's when people need to go on dialysis.

PATIENT X463
I know.

DOCTOR X463
So you're halfway, more than halfway there to needing dialysis.

PATIENT X463
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X463
Dialysis so it's just um, it's so important.  That's why it's so important and I want you to know dialysis is a miserable lifestyle.

PATIENT X463
I know.

DOCTOR X463
You have to go in two times a week.  You have to stay, it's not @@@ bad.  Um and you know.

PATIENT X463
So hey I want to get this under control.

DOCTOR X463
So that's why, so that's why it's important to you know have, you know for us to talk now and um for you to get your blood pressure under control so we can preserve what you have left because there's no magic pill to grow new kidneys.

PATIENT X463
I know.

DOCTOR X463
Just you know, technically just can't do it.  Um otherwise you know I think that has to be the main issue uh for today.  Um.

PATIENT X463
I guarantee when I come back in here it'll be better.

DOCTOR X463
Okay, okay.  I mean it's not for me; it's for you you know.

PATIENT X463
Yeah, yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X463

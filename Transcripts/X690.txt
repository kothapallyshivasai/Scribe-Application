SECOND PERSON X690

SECOND PERSON X690

PATIENT X690
Uh.  Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X690
@@@.

PATIENT X690
Now I take this and this.

SECOND PERSON X690
How come your cholesterol pill @@@ this one here but I don't know @@@ more than once, I don't know that one.

PATIENT X690
No @@@.

SECOND PERSON X690
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X690
That say how much of that I'm taking or do you know?

SECOND PERSON X690
I don't see that.

PATIENT X690
It may say over here, it's 1/2 but I'm still on that.

SECOND PERSON X690
Okay well what, why would he give you two of the same things?

PATIENT X690
He did?

SECOND PERSON X690
@@@ me?

PATIENT X690

PATIENT X690
Yeah that's uh.

DOCTOR X690
Which, what is that name?

SECOND PERSON X690
He @@@, he's taken a half and one instead of just cutting one in half.

DOCTOR X690
That's from.

PATIENT X690
That's all I do is take one and a half.

SECOND PERSON X690
One and a half is two, two times @@@.

DOCTOR X690
That's for mental health.

PATIENT X690
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X690
I know.

DOCTOR X690
You have to talk with DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X690
I'll talk to him, I'll just go.

PATIENT X690
Yeah see here this is because it's one tablet and its 800 mg so.

SECOND PERSON X690
Okay.

PATIENT X690
So cut it in half.

SECOND PERSON X690
Well this is 350, okay.  If you take them, @@@ and if you cut that @@@ that's it.

PATIENT X690 
I do one and a half.

SECOND PERSON X690
Okay, that's what I'm saying, @@@ not anymore, then all you have to do is you got to pill in half, you cut one pill in half and take one in the morning and one at night. 

DOCTOR X690
These are the same prescriptions.

PATIENT X690
Right.

SECOND PERSON X690
That's what I'm saying.

PATIENT X690
@@@.

DOCTOR X690
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X690
And they're the same.

DOCTOR X690
Don't worry about that, that's not a big deal because he only gets one, one set of pills at this amount of time and if he has two, three, four prescriptions, it doesn't matter, it's not like he's getting charged more and we only charge you on the things that they get through the VA and what that means is that when someone orders a prescription instead of renewing it they just order another prescription for the same thing.

SECOND PERSON X690
Oh.

DOCTOR X690
It's just listed twice.

SECOND PERSON X690
But do not; he's not getting it twice?  And he's got two bottles at home.

PATIENT X690
No I don't.

SECOND PERSON X690
You don't?

PATIENT X690

SECOND PERSON X690
Okay then.

PATIENT X690
If it comes to me it is one pill.

SECOND PERSON X690
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X690

SECOND PERSON X690
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X690
Take one in the morning and one in the evening.

SECOND PERSON X690
Yeah but I thought you was getting two different bottles, that's what I thought.

PATIENT X690
No, no.

SECOND PERSON X690
@@@.

DOCTOR X690
Okay, anything else?

PATIENT X690
That's good enough.

DOCTOR X690

SECOND PERSON X690
Well then tell him what you had taken.

DOCTOR X690
Well the other thing too is you know how are you taking the medicine?  Are you taking it, are you taking it with food?  No, how come?

SECOND PERSON X690
@@@.

PATIENT X690
No @@@.

DOCTOR X690
It's not @@@ having food in the stomach or taking medicines on an empty stomach, you know now there's some medicines that you're supposed to do that.

PATIENT X690
Right.

DOCTOR X690
But most medicines you are to take with food um but a couple of things, number one is the medicines can upset the stomach or @@@ that you know takes care of that and other people have you know some @@@.  Uh @@@ you know if I had to guess.  How often are you using the albuterol?

PATIENT X690
Not that often.

DOCTOR X690
Once a day?

SECOND PERSON X690
Uh uh.

PATIENT X690
Uh uh.

SECOND PERSON X690
@@@ the medicine.  He'll utilized it @@@.

PATIENT X690
Yeah, no uh.

SECOND PERSON X690
You use it @@@ a day okay.

DOCTOR X690
How many times, once, twice a day?

PATIENT X690
Once a day.

DOCTOR X690
Okay if I had to guess that it was any of your medicines, it's that cause that is well known.  It makes your heart rate go up, it makes people jittery um I took albuterol and it does that to me um it's just one of those @@@ uh the albuterol @@@.

PATIENT X690
Well will uh Depakote and @@@ cause I'm taking 1500 mg at night.

DOCTOR X690
At night.

PATIENT X690
At night.

DOCTOR X690
Uh-huh.  And when are you shaking the most?  Is it all day or in the morning or?

PATIENT X690
In the morning yeah after uh I get up and when I get up.

DOCTOR X690
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X690
And if I have coffee and then I start shaking.

DOCTOR X690
You got a coffee?

PATIENT X690
Yeah.

DOCTOR X690
Coffee can do that too.  And you're not eating anything?  Are you eating breakfast every morning?  Uh you know, everything that you've mentioned is @@@ could be causing you know the coffee, not eating, uh the albuterol which if I would guess I would say it'd be the albuterol but I, you know, I don't know when you, it depends on when you take the albuterol and then when you have your shaking, uh you know having taken the medicines on an empty stomach that can also you know cause that.  You're not shaking right now um so it'd probably.

PATIENT X690
That's because I had no medication and no coffee.

DOCTOR X690
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X690
No you @@@.  

DOCTOR X690
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X690
They say yes @@@.  I'm telling you when he has his coffee in his hand he shakes so, the coffee done come out of his hand, he be shaking and stuff and I say @@@ what is happening here and he say I think it my medicine I'm taking you know.

PATIENT X690

SECOND PERSON X690
Yeah maybe we could tell them that's not helping @@@ maybe we just tell that doctor about @@@.

DOCTOR X690

SECOND PERSON X690
@@@.

DOCTOR X690

PATIENT X690
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X690
He'll take it.

PATIENT X690

SECOND PERSON X690
Did the medicine help?

PATIENT X690
It's the sugar.

DOCTOR X690
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X690
He said he's gonna take it.

PATIENT X690
@@@.

DOCTOR X690
Are you checking your sugars at home?

PATIENT X690
Yeah.  I have been um, a nurse NAME and uh a doctor comes once a nurse and the nurse comes once a week.

DOCTOR X690
Okay, we'll check it today.

PATIENT X690
Okay.  What are you saying about that?

DOCTOR X690
There's a couple here that are a little high but I want to, I want to check something called an A1c, it's like your sugar, it reflects your sugar over the last three months.

PATIENT X690
Okay.

DOCTOR X690
So if it's chronically high and your A1c is high then we'll probably need to start something to help your sugars okay.  But those really aren't that bad.  There's a couple there that are pretty high but I don't know if I'm willing to say that that's diabetes, that you have diabetes.

SECOND PERSON X690
Uh-huh, he's borderline.  He's @@@.

DOCTOR X690
Okay.

PATIENT X690
This is something else that the doctor wrote, what do you think?

DOCTOR X690
Okay @@@.  Alright, we may, this is actually, this is good that you brought this in because this is the blood test that I would have ordered um and it looks a little high um so.  Let me see what DOCTOR would like us to set up something or whether or not you know you want to work on, well let's talk about it.  I need to talk to her, I think that she will want to start you on you know @@@ diabetes medicine because you keep telling me you know you're blood pressure is high, I mean your blood sugar is high @@@ we've got to do something.  That's not normal, @@@.

SECOND PERSON X690
How high was it, how high was it?

DOCTOR X690
135.

SECOND PERSON X690
Hmm.

DOCTOR X690
And close to the top, 126 is the cut off so anything above 126 on an empty stomach is uh diagnosed as diabetes.

SECOND PERSON X690
Did you have an empty stomach that day you took it?  So when did you take it?

DOCTOR X690
So when did you take it?

SECOND PERSON X690

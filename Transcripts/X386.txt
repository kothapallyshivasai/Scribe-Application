PATIENT X386
I just threw the letter away.

DOCTOR X386
Oh you did okay.  What can we help with?

PATIENT X386
Uh.

DOCTOR X386
I just take @@@.

PATIENT X386
Of where I've been the last couple of weeks.

DOCTOR X386
@@@ for you.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
I have my brief notes so on December 11th you had the fainting spell.  You went into an acute renal failure.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
And then you had the pulmonary edema and then back to the ICU and only then back into the real world.

PATIENT X386
And then I had uh two visits to the Emergency Room since then.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah with the bleeding.

PATIENT X386
The bleeding and the blood clots in my legs yeah.

DOCTOR X386
And then Urology saw you both times and basically you went to Urology cause I don't think I've seen you since but uh October 5th okay.

SECOND PERSON X386
No I think

PATIENT X386
So that was cancelled.

SECOND PERSON X386
They told us to cancel it.

PATIENT X386
The last time I was in the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X386
Oh they did @@@.

PATIENT X386
The surgeons had put in that there was no need cause that was basically Monday.

DOCTOR X386
Hmm, right.

PATIENT X386
From Monday.  She said there was no need for me to come.

DOCTOR X386
@@@.

PATIENT X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
Okay so is it just mostly the bleeding issues, the Urology issues that are getting you down for the moment?

PATIENT X386
Right, both right.  I just.  She wants me to rest so I don't, to control the bleeding whatever you know and they also want me to exercise to build my strength back up again.

DOCTOR X386
Right.

PATIENT X386
So it's like.

DOCTOR X386
Take one go to another one.

PATIENT X386
Take one go to another one.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.  But you know anytime you get someone admitted for a prolonged stay at the hospital there's always the @@@ little like you're in the hospital, you're not sleeping well; we're not exactly feeding you everything yeah.

PATIENT X386
You eat a little right yeah.

DOCTOR X386
And then you know you're also sick and you're fighting against an infection.

PATIENT X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
So that's the kind of thing.  So any sort of recovery after that is gonna take time.  Uh my question is besides the weakness at home how have you been?

PATIENT X386
I think I'm feeling good.

DOCTOR X386
Doing okay.

SECOND PERSON X386
He's doing better.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So let's start with the urology issues, I mean how are you urinating right now?

PATIENT X386
I'm urinating fine uh.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
As of this morning my urine was totally clear so.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
Uh that's @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X386
Oh that is.

PATIENT X386
Because the bleeding that came out, it was at the time, I really didn't exert myself.

DOCTOR X386
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X386
You know, if I can get the stents out the sooner the better I think would be but from I understand it, the scheduling issues with the urologist.

DOCTOR X386
They're a busy service, Urology.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
But no blood in the urine right now.

PATIENT X386
Right, well as of this morning that's it no.

DOCTOR X386
Uh any pain when you urinate?

PATIENT X386
No.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
No pain.

DOCTOR X386
Now are you going to the bathroom more often, less often or about as normally as you usually do?

PATIENT X386
I would say probably more often.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So are you drinking more water you think?

PATIENT X386
I'm drinking fluids right yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  Did they tell you to increase your fluids?

SECOND PERSON X386
No they put a restriction on his fluids when he was in the hospital.

PATIENT X386
I was on fluid restriction when I was in the hospital. 

SECOND PERSON X386
@@@ I think.

DOCTOR X386
@@@.

PATIENT X386
Right.

SECOND PERSON X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
But this last time uh in the Emergency Room, you know it was like.

DOCTOR X386
Oh go back to regular peeing.

PATIENT X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
That's @@@.  Okay.  Now any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X386
No.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  Any pain along the back?

PATIENT X386
I'm still taking the Cipro for another.

SECOND PERSON X386
@@@.

PATIENT X386
I think the end of the week, I think that's.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X386
That's right.

DOCTOR X386
Okay, so no fevers, chills.  Any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT X386
No.

DOCTOR X386
Are you eating everything okay at home?

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Your appetite's fine?

PATIENT X386
@@@.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  Sleeping okay at night?

PATIENT X386
Uh not really.  I sleep like from yeah maybe 2 hours, 2 1/2 hours tops.

DOCTOR X386
What happens um?

PATIENT X386
Well I wake up.  Sometimes I wake you know have to go and urinate you know and then I come.

(Someone knocks on the door)

DOCTOR X386
Okay sleeping 2-3 hours at a time and then waking up.  Is there anything in particular that you feel is waking you up.  I mean are you in pain?

PATIENT X386
No just can't sleep.

DOCTOR X386
Anything bothering you?  No.

SECOND PERSON X386
Same time every night.

PATIENT X386
I have, prior to all this situation; I had you know I guess you'd call it restless leg syndrome, leg pain, once or twice a month.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
I don't if there's a.

DOCTOR X386
Maybe it's, in the past have you had a sleep study done to check for sleep apnea?

PATIENT X386
No.

DOCTOR X386
No.  Okay.  Any uh, cause could be something you might expect, I mean have you ever been told that you snore, snore excessively?

SECOND PERSON X386
He's never snored, no.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
Not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR X386
@@@ and then in the morning when you do sleep and you wake up do you feel pretty refreshed or do you still feel pretty tired when you wake up?

PATIENT X386
Well normally I feel refreshed but all this that's going on I don't feel like and when I wake up I'm not.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  The @@@ you're probably waking up @@@.

PATIENT X386
It's mostly @@@ like you know it's not like I'm @@@ take it.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
Okay then @@@.

SECOND PERSON X386
But most of the time @@@.

PATIENT X386
Right since the hospital.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So.

PATIENT X386
And even if I take you know like a nap you know during the day and all that, I'm not sleeping, ready to bounce out of bed.

DOCTOR X386
Do you feel like you fall asleep pretty easily during the day?

PATIENT X386
Yes.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So if we kind of left you alone in this room for ten minutes do you think you'd dose off?

PATIENT X386
No.

DOCTOR X386
No.

PATIENT X386
But maybe even @@@.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So this is the most important question I guess, has anyone ever expressed to you that you stop breathing at night while you're sleeping, have you been told that that happens?

PATIENT X386
@@@.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  Alright so.  Uh something you can consider but there's really not a lot of clinical issues to support doing a sleep study right now.  One of the things that can cause restless leg in people who have sleep apnea, people who have these sort of events overnight when they stop breathing.

PATIENT X386
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X386
But right now I think the biggest thing you need is to build your strength and everything back up after the hospitalization.  Let me go through your most recent blood work and see if there's anything that really stands out to me.  I know they check your urine a lot and they take it every time that you come here um, as far as your last blood test and you've had a lot of them in the last year.

PATIENT X386
Yes they do.

DOCTOR X386
Especially being in the hospital.

PATIENT X386
If I have any blood left.

DOCTOR X386
So I mean that's fine.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.  I have a history of low platelets.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.  Okay, I know you've had troubles with that.  Um okay.  So that's from the hospital point of few.  Uh how far are you able to walk right now before you have any problems?

PATIENT X386
I walk probably to the hallway.

DOCTOR X386
Is the wheelchair in use since being discharged or just something you.

PATIENT X386
No I knew that I couldn't walk from @@@ you know all the way over here.  I knew I couldn't walk that far.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  But then before you had this most recent hospitalization were you able to @@@.

PATIENT X386
Oh yeah, yeah.  Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON X386
Yes.

DOCTOR X386
Okay you were walking then.

PATIENT X386
Yeah, no that's good.

SECOND PERSON X386
Probably because he's kind of weak.  He still @@@ his feet.  @@@.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  Now have you started uh have you done any form of physical therapy or rehabilitation since discharge?

SECOND PERSON X386
Well they told him to walk.

PATIENT X386
No they just told me to.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
Just do walking but I didn't need any you know.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X386
But then when the bleeding started she said to stop walking.

PATIENT X386
To stop walking.

SECOND PERSON X386
So you know he was not.

PATIENT X386
Like it's a Catch 22 you know.

DOCTOR X386
Alright.

PATIENT X386
That's kind of what I'm saying today you know life says stop with the blood now I'm like you know this afternoon it's like right back up again, just a little bit of.

DOCTOR X386
With a little bit of exertion?

SECOND PERSON X386
Right.

PATIENT X386
The walking that I've done and it really isn't exerting.  I mean it's not like I'm lifting something or anything like that.

DOCTOR X386
I think a couple of things to keep in mind, first of all I don't think a little bit of blood could color the whole urine.  The other thing is you know whatever caused this you've got to get the bleeding or something, you got it stented.

PATIENT X386
Yeah that's what they did yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Um right and that's always gonna be there and that's gonna cause irritation sometimes until they take it out.

PATIENT X386
Uh-huh right.

DOCTOR X386
And then whatever was bleeding tends to clot and if those clots, sometimes they could dislodge.  It's more common with stents, it's more common in the bladder but um anyway you know because you do have bleeding kind of like that.  As long as it's not, you know if it's pink pink urine.

PATIENT X386
This is like cranberry juice.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.

PATIENT X386
I mean it started dark.

DOCTOR X386
That's dark.

PATIENT X386
It's darker yeah.  It's darker yeah, it's not.

SECOND PERSON X386
It comes out really dark red.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  Alright so I mean Urology has seen you just recently and they're the experts in that.  That's not my area of expertise.

PATIENT X386
Oh.

DOCTOR X386
I'll let them manage that.  Uh let's focus on some of your other sort of more medical problems which uh hypertension.  So today in clinic blood pressure not doing so bad 130/60, so I'm happy with that.  Uh your pulse was a little fast so I'll recheck that in just a minute.

PATIENT X386
It's normally; my normal pulse is between 90 and 100.

DOCTOR X386
90 and 100 okay.  So I think it's over 100, we just want to make sure.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
So yours was 104, so I'll just double check it.

PATIENT X386
Oh in a minute yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Okay just so fair warning, you're right-handed.  

PATIENT X386
Cause everybody when I come here everybody says you know are you nervous about being here and I go no, no that's normal for me.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
And I don't notice that it's.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
You know that it's fast.

DOCTOR X386
And you're not having any palpitations?

PATIENT X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
Chest pain, anxiety, no okay.  So then the other thing is the hyperlipidemia.  So the last time you had your cholesterol checked, it was actually very recently I think September 17th which was a couple of weeks ago.

PATIENT X386
When I was in the hospital.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah, it seemed that they checked it in the hospital, it's usually not a hospital test that they usually do @@@.

SECOND PERSON X386
They tested him for everything.

PATIENT X386
Yeah everything.

DOCTOR X386
Figured while you were there why not right?

PATIENT X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
So uh the bad cholesterol is fine, it's well controlled actually and then your triglycerides still look fine.  The good cholesterol was a little bit low but I'm not going to chase that number right now, we'll just see what a few months will do so I'll wait at this time.  I refilled your medications so do you need any of those?

PATIENT X386
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X386
And then the Lantus, the test strips, and they ordered a Coude catheter I don't know why they did that.

SECOND PERSON X386
No, you don't have to reorder that.

PATIENT X386
No.

SECOND PERSON X386
You never know.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah let me, let me, let me discontinue that.

PATIENT X386
That was ill-advised.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.  That's supposed to be a one way street you know.  It was really supposed to come out then.

SECOND PERSON X386
Exactly.

PATIENT X386
@@@.  My doctor's answer that but when I saw him, he never should have.

SECOND PERSON X386
Ever.

patient h495
With my history of low platelets.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
And all that he says it never should've happened.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X386
@@@.

PATIENT X386
Been put on that to begin with.  

DOCTOR X386
And then the statin I refilled.

PATIENT X386
Okay.

DOCTOR X386
Uh the metformin I also reordered and the Losartan I reordered.  The finasteride for the prostate I also reordered.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
And then the Cipro they gave you enough for to finish the treatment so I don't think you have to worry about that and now was there anything else?

PATIENT X386
The only post treatment, that there's any question about it is the high @@@.

DOCTOR X386
Tamsulosin?

PATIENT X386
Yes.

DOCTOR X386
Um.

SECOND PERSON X386
Is that the @@@ medicine?  It thins the blood?

PATIENT X386
@@@.

DOCTOR X386
No BP or BPH.

SECOND PERSON X386
Blood pressure, blood pressure.

PATIENT X386
Blood pressure.

DOCTOR X386
Okay, okay.  

PATIENT X386
I get like a dry cough.

DOCTOR X386
Okay so uh Losartan.

PATIENT X386
I've heard that some blood pressure medicines.

DOCTOR X386
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X386
Can cause that sort of thing.  So it's not a constant thing but I.

DOCTOR X386
The ones that most commonly cause it are called ACE inhibitors and uh those are medications like lisinopril or Captopril.  They all have a pril ending.

PATIENT X386
Hmm.

DOCTOR X386
And then what happens is after that we got a new generation of medicines that kind of work in a similar fashion but they don't have that side effect and those are something called ARP and that's a medication like Losartan.

SECOND PERSON X386
And that's what he's on.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah so we just need to get it down.  Losartan does not cause that.

SECOND PERSON X386
Okay.  Okay, probably something else.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.  I have a question about the medications.  Is there any way that I'm assuming that you probably just reordered the @@@ just has been in the past.  Is there any way to increase the metformin and the simvastatin so I have actually have more than that?

DOCTOR X386
Yeah I think what I did was I have to put everything in for 90 days.

PATIENT X386
Yeah, yeah.  Because yeah it's something I'm gonna be on.

DOCTOR X386
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X386
And having to reorder you know.

SECOND PERSON X386
Constantly.

PATIENT X386
Constantly every month uh.

DOCTOR X386
So I'm just looking through it, I'm making sure that I think that's yeah, that's gonna take care of it.

PATIENT X386
Okay.

DOCTOR X386
I think that's the most that the VA will actually let me do.

SECOND PERSON X386
That's better than 30 days’ worth.  So.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
So 90 days and then three refills is as many as they'll let me fill.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X386
Per year?

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X386
Sure.

PATIENT X386
I get it.  And the simvastatin is the only one @@@ reordered it.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
He probably said you need to fill it.  @@@.

DOCTOR X386
So all that's taken care of.

PATIENT X386
That's all good.

DOCTOR X386
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X386
So now does he have to reorder it or they're all gonna be ordered so you just put in the prescriptions but they're not @@@.

PATIENT X386
They're there yeah.

DOCTOR X386
So it's a prescription and just like before.  So you'll call the VA.

PATIENT X386
So we will just continue right.

DOCTOR X386
And then next time they'll send you 90 days’ worth.

PATIENT X386
Okay.

DOCTOR X386
With three refills.

PATIENT X386
Okay.  The only other thing I got is and I don't think it's in your qualifications is helping moving up the.

DOCTOR X386
Oh the stent, have the stent removed?

PATIENT X386
Stent removal.

DOCTOR X386
Oh.  @@@.

(Someone comes to the door and the doctor visits with them)

PATIENT X386
Leave from here yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Anyway.

SECOND PERSON X386
No the issue with the bleeding is that we feel that you know they have him bleeding intermittently for the next six weeks.

PATIENT X386
For six more weeks.

SECOND PERSON X386
Sounds like an awfully long time and the cause of it could be gotten out of there.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X386
You know what you know who wants to have bled for six weeks?  Cause this seems like so long.  And they said it was a scheduling issue you know well, the body can handle it.

DOCTOR X386
Well no I understand, I feel the same way and to be honest I mean there's not a lot I can do from my end.

SECOND PERSON X386
I know, we understand.

DOCTOR X386
They don't let me go in there and take the stents out ourselves, that's the problem.

PATIENT X386
No I know.

SECOND PERSON X386
But we were hoping you could put a word in or something.

PATIENT X386
She did say, the surgeon she did say what was it Monday at noon @@@ she was going to try to do something to move it up I don't know.  But uh you know, six weeks of watching every time that I you know I mean it's all there.  Sometimes you know just wait like I'm saying I might go home today now and sometimes the little bit of walking that I'm doing might.

SECOND PERSON X386
@@@.

PATIENT X386
I could talk to them yeah but.  

SECOND PERSON X386
And can you get a flu shot too?

PATIENT X386
Oh yeah the flu shot and the pneumonia shot.  The nurse wanted to give it but I wanted to talk to you first.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.

PATIENT X386
Because being on.

DOCTOR X386
The antibiotics you're on.

PATIENT X386
Antibiotic and all that.

SECOND PERSON X386
@@@ infection.

PATIENT X386
Should I hold off on it or take it now?

DOCTOR X386
You can come back in a week and just come back and tell them that you need to get the shots, come down again.  Cause you'll be done with your antibiotics by them.

PATIENT X386
But wait, so wait until I am off?

DOCTOR X386
Yeah, yeah and it's not you know really there's no I mean we could do it today but I'm just gonna be more of a cautious guy than @@@.

PATIENT X386
That's what I thought cause you know that maybe it was yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.  Because again you're not having any symptoms and it looks like the antibiotics are doing their jobs.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Give it a while.  I mean if it's convenient for you to come back in a week but by all means.

PATIENT X386
Well I got to come back in.

SECOND PERSON X386
I think while he was in the hospital he @@@ and then you know oh you'll go home with antibiotics but he kept being allergic to everything.

PATIENT X386
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  

SECOND PERSON X386
So they introduced another thing now, it's kind of scary.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah so we'll.

SECOND PERSON X386
But that's what they wanted to do @@@.

PATIENT X386
Right.  Well why don't you set it up, cause I'm coming back for.

DOCTOR X386
I'll tell you what, you know what I'll do is I'll ask DOCTOR my senior physician and I'm pretty sure that she would want you to get it today but I'm gonna see if you can wait or not wait.  I personally don't have a strong preference but I'll see if my attending physician has a strong preference for now okay.

SECOND PERSON X386
Cause he did have the flu and pneumonia and it's just kind of scary though but whatever you think is right.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  I don't think uh the last time they checked your blood sugar level, that hemoglobin A1c which tells us how well your sugars has been controlled for three months um it was very @@@.  Your number was like perfect.

PATIENT X386
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X386
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X386
I mean like it's amazing.  I think it affects.

PATIENT X386
No I haven't, I haven't been taking my metformin.

DOCTOR X386
Right cause you had the renal failure.

PATIENT X386
And because and the Cipro the pharmacist said not to take it while I'm on Cipro.

DOCTOR X386
Now when you're checking your blood sugars at home how have they been?

PATIENT X386
120, 140.

DOCTOR X386
140 okay.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.  I think I'm really border, I'm borderline yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Borderline diabetic.

SECOND PERSON X386
Yeah.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So again uh it's okay if the sugars are, you know like if we don't control them so tightly as long as they're below 200, 250 I'm fine.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Like a small window.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So the diabetes is fine.

PATIENT X386
I think we got that controlled pretty good.

DOCTOR X386
Okay and then Urology is following you so that's fine.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  So why don't you go ahead and have a seat up here.  Go ahead and @@@.

PATIENT X386
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X386
Have you noticed any swelling in your legs?  @@@.

PATIENT X386
Yeah I mean walking @@@.

DOCTOR X386
@@@.

PATIENT X386
@@@ It's an overall condition.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X386
Socks.

PATIENT X386
Okay socks yeah.  And it's not like @@@ just cause I can't do anything else it's just that I @@@.

DOCTOR X386
Now have you been getting better since your discharge, since you left the hospital like every day are you making some progress?

SECOND PERSON X386
I think so until @@@.

PATIENT X386
Then I start @@@ down.

SECOND PERSON X386
Well I think he went backwards on that.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X386
But we thought after ten days before that that he felt like @@@.

PATIENT X386
Oh yeah, oh yeah I was definitely improved from when I was discharged yeah.

SECOND PERSON X386
With all that again and.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
Cause I was making sure that I was doing much better.  It doesn't look like @@@ just a couple days ago.

SECOND PATIENT X386
Yeah @@@.
PATIENT X386
And so.

DOCTOR X386
Let's take a look.

SECOND PERSON X386
Yeah he's got color back.  You were pasty for a while.  You look much better you know look at you, you're better now.

DOCTOR X386
Take a deep breath and again, deep breath and again.  @@@.  Nice deep breath with your mouth open and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out.  Alright.  Now before when someone's listened to your heart have they ever told you that they hear a murmur or anything like that?

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X386
Yes.

DOCTOR X386
Okay so that's not new.  That's something that's been there for years?  Okay.  Can you lean forward?  Take a deep breath and out, okay.

PATIENT X386
When I was in the hospital they said I needed to get an echocardiogram.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
To see if the valve leaks.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.  Did you ever @@@.

PATIENT X386
Uh-huh.  @@@.

DOCTOR X386
I need you to @@@ one more time.  The reason is that the heart murmur that you have, in some people what it can do is it can travel up the neck which is fine but I'm not concerned about it.  If I hear a murmur that's just in the neck then that's something I'd want to investigate.

PATIENT X386
Hmm.  I don't think she did.

DOCTOR X386
Okay.

PATIENT X386
@@@.

DOCTOR X386
Well here's the thing, when I marked @@@ the heart, marking it up.

PATIENT X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
This @@@.  Deep breath in and again.  @@@ over there.  Okay.  Any problems with dizziness, lightheadedness?  No nothing like that.  Any chest pains.

PATIENT X386
No.

DOCTOR X386
Shortness of breath?

PATIENT X386
No.

DOCTOR X386
No.  Trouble breathing when you're lying flat at night?

PATIENT X386
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X386
But you can do it?

PATIENT X386
I can do it @@@.

DOCTOR X386
Alright @@@.

PATIENT X386
Right.  I was laying on my side again.  

DOCTOR X386
Okay so @@@ recently.

PATIENT X386

DOCTOR X386

PATIENT X386

DOCTOR X386
Just um @@@.  

PATIENT X386
Oh.

DOCTOR X386
Cause no one can really see @@@ recently.  A very unique coloration.

PATIENT X386
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X386
@@@.  Over okay.  Then another thing is @@@ on Monday @@@ um the reason why we @@@, the reason why we'd be interested in looking at the eyes is you when we pull your eyelids down, you know there are a lot of blood vessels @@@.  

SECOND PERSON X386
@@@.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.

PATIENT X386
Well that's a really good thing.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.  @@@.  And your blood pressure was high as well.  @@@.  Now things that would tell me you know if you @@@ for anemia you know you're having shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, that kind of thing, well if that starts to happen, that's when you come into the Emergency Department and call me and we'll check your hemoglobin level and make sure everything's okay.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
But.

PATIENT X386
Oh she also told me she that she wanted me to @@@.  She just wondered about @@@.

DOCTOR X386

PATIENT X386
Yeah.  She said if I wanted to you know, went into you know, @@@.

DOCTOR X386
You can't urinate.

PATIENT X386
You can't urinate and your potassium right.

DOCTOR X386
@@@ there you go.  @@@ yeah she got it covered.  Alright so what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go outside and talk to DOCTOR and double check about the Pneumovax vaccine and um there's really not much else that we need to address today.  Blood pressure looks like it’s doing okay.  Lipids are fine.  The diabetes is a well under control so it's okay to hold the metformin for now and then.

SECOND PERSON X386
He @@@.

PATIENT X386
Right.

DOCTOR X386
Yeah.  Give me a second @@@.

SECOND PERSON X386
Okay.

DOCTOR X386
Alright so I'll be right back.

PATIENT X386
Okay.

DOCTOR X386
I have a feeling when I come back I'm gonna schedule this here. @@@.

SECOND PERSON X386
Oh no @@@.

DOCTOR OUT:  71:45  DOCTOR IN:  79:50

DOCTOR X386
Alright.  Okay so actually um like I said earlier, I was sitting on the fence with the Pneumovax.  The only contraindication would be if you actually had an active infection.  Uh in patients actually so what happens patients come, they're at risk for pneumonia and if they have in an infection we treat them for pneumonia and then before they discharged um we can give them the vaccine so it's very safe.  So yes today for influenza and yes to the pneumonia vaccine today.

SECOND PERSON X386
Alright.

PATIENT X386
Okay.

DOCTOR X386
Alright.  So then I told the nurse and they're gonna start setting that up for you so when you're getting ready to leave you're ready to go.

SECOND PERSON X386
Okay.

DOCTOR X386
Uh any other questions for me?  I think that uh so things are going really well right now um.  Mostly your health problems are very well controlled.  It's just you had this spell and then all these complications that came as a result.

PATIENT X386
Yeah.

DOCTOR X386
So Urology is really @@@ point on that.  Now if you've had any problems you're always welcome to come back and see me um but if everything stays the course I think a year would be fine to come back.

SECOND PERSON X386
Oh sure.

PATIENT X386
Are you gonna be here in a year?

DOCTOR X386
Oh I'll be here for at least three years.

PATIENT X386

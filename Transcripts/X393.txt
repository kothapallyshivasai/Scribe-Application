AUDIO NAME:		X393



DOCTOR X393: 	This is your first time here in a while?  

PATIENT X393:	Yeah.

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.  What can we do for you today?

PATIENT X393:	I am having a lot of knee pain.

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	You are down here @@@.

PATIENT X393:	I feel like @@@ and I am you know @@@.  I don’t really do anything anymore @@@.

DOCTOR X393:	Oh, Okay.  Is one worse than the other, or are they both about the same?

PATIENT X393:	Um periodically @@@.  I want to really find out what really causing problems and I am thinking about the @@@ and asking about the things @@@.  I just would like to see where it is.  

DOCTOR X393: 	Well, okay.  Tell me about the pain first? Where does it hurt? When do you get pain?  

PATIENT X393:	Okay, normally it is up in here and around here.

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.

PATIENT X393:	If I do a lot of squatting it is here.  Sometimes my knees pops and creeks.  There are a lot of things I can't do.  Like @@@. I have gained some weight.  I gained weight.

DOCTOR X393: 	You are a pretty skinny guy.

PATIENT X393:	If I get to 185 to 190, I mean it is a big difference to me. @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.  Are you taking anything for it?  Over-the-counter or anything like that?  

PATIENT X393:	No, I am not a big prescription type person, if I don't know what the side effects are?

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.

PATIENT X393:	I don't want to take anything @@@. I would like to find out and see what is wrong?

DOCTOR X393: 	Are you playing any sports?  Are you playing basketball?

PATIENT X393:	I mean my mobility, just starts aching.  I know I am getting older, but this is @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	You’re still able to do it @@@.

PATIENT X393:	I don't like feeling this way.

DOCTOR X393: 	It hurts?

PATIENT X393:	Not only does it hurt, but it hurts my feelings.

DOCTOR X393: 	Laughs.

PATIENT X393:	It hurts my feeling, @@@ this is my life here.

DOCTOR X393: 	Well I think we can take x-rays today. 

PATIENT X393:	That's okay.

DOCTOR X393: 	And I am going to examine @@@. It could be some arthritis.  From playing ball for years and now you are 38 or whatever.  You are getting to the point where the pounding all those years and the cartilage the stuff that helps kind of cushion the blow starts to wear away and that is when you start having pain.  Um, figuring out what it is.  If there is something we can do, if it is one thing it is nice.  The problem there is now great cure for arthritis.  What we try to do is we give you medicines, like antiinflammatory medicines to kind of relief the pain and decrease the inflammation which is part of the problem.  Then trying to strengthen the muscles around it.  When you lean to side-to-side or when you participate in sports for a long time which does not help.  But, we can strengthen both the quads, the calves, the hamstrings so that it supports the bones very well which helps kind of decrease some of the inflammation and helps keep things more stable.

PATIENT X393:	Okay.  Yeah. It is just knee pain now.  

DOCTOR X393:	Laughs.

PATIENT X393:	I know I am stiff now, but I am saying that @@@.  I never felt my hamstring before.  @@@.  I do a lot of home improvement type activities now.  @@@.  I never felt it before, but now I know that @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	You are lucky.  I pulled my hamstring in high school and I swear like it almost never healed, like I still there is something. @@@.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.  I never had a hamstring injury or knee contusion.  I know I have hamstrings now.  You know?

DOCTOR X393: 	Yeah, laughs.

PATIENT X393:	I would just like to get this thing where I can figure out what is truly wrong with it.  I feel like, like I said, I have been suffering for a long time now.

DOCTOR X393: 	What we will do, we will take pictures today to try to confirm what I think it is.  @@@ the beginning of arthritis.  What I think we should do is start you on some antiinflammatory medications, which is just like ibuprofen.  Stuff you can buy over-the-counter but you can get it here probably cheaper than you can buy over-the-counter so you might as well do it through the VA since you got that.  What we will probably do is may be start it every day, about once or twice a day for a couple of weeks and then I would walk, whether you are trying good or not to try to decrease some of the inflammation, then after that just start using it when you need it.

PATIENT X393:	What is making the popping in the knee?

DOCTOR X393: 	The popping is, it depends, it can be a combination of there could be some damage in there and it is a little unstable.  But, also it is not abnormal to have popping as we age and the stuff wears down there is more like air @@@.  It is actually the air coming out of your blood and into the joint and @@@ crack our knuckles. That is what you are hearing.  It is actually not a sign of how bad the knee is necessarily.

PATIENT X393:	@@@ because a lot of the time I hear @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Why don't you hop up here and let me take a look at it.  It is not necessarily a sign that it is better or worse.  It can happen.  @@@ as long as things are stable.  You ever feel like your knees are giving out on you or anything?

PATIENT X393:	Oh, I felt like @@@ like I said @@@.

DOCTOR X393:	What did you do?

PATIENT X393:	@@@, five miles, six miles. @@@.

KNOCK ON DOOR, DOCTOR ANSWERS DOOR 09:58 - 10:01.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	You still have pain from that?

PATIENT X393:	@@@ I always have pain.  Basically what it is, is I just tough it out.  @@@ I be pissed off @@@.  By the time I was 20 years old I started having problems with it.  They gave me a disability rating when I got out.  I am just getting to the point that I don't want to go on like this forever.  When I got out @@@. @@@ in 2000.  I had a lot of friends that told me.

DOCTOR X393: 	You are no where near a knee operation I don’t think.  You don't want a knee operation.  You don't want to think about that.  Although I don't think that is curative for a lot of people.  @@@.  That is all I can do.  @@@.  We got nothing, @@@.

PATIENT X393:	I am changing my mind now.

DOCTOR X393:	How @@@.

PATIENT X393:	I always thought about this. @@@ and I don’t want no part of that.

DOCTOR X393: 	Well, @@@, don't worry about that.  But, 30 years from now if you needed surgery it is not a bad type @@@.  We'll talk more about that later.  @@@. Is your pain somewhat down here?

PATIENT X393:	Around the @@@ area.

DOCTOR X393: 	And that is kind of the same area you get the pain at?

PATIENT X393:	I get the pain actually all in here.

DOCTOR X393: 	Does it hurts in there when I push?

PATIENT X393:	It is hurting me now.

DOCTOR X393: 	In this area.

PATIENT X393:	And it is always going around this area and like I said in and down.  Squatting over, doing something, cutting dry wall or cutting wood or anything it might be okay for ten minutes and next thing I know there is pain @@@.  Then I notice pain starts to start.  In that same muscle.

DOCTOR X393:  	@@@.

PATIENT X393:	I understand.

DOCTOR X393: 	That is all they talked to you about the symptoms and the knee pain @@@.

PATIENT X393:	I got a little pain here. @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	@@@ the cartilage and stuff between the @@@ and around a little bit.  But the other thing is the meniscus is like a plate that kind of helps your knee @@@ and everything.  May be that tore free, whatever.  This is when the pain can be at.  No, whether we decide to do surgery on that if we have to.  I don't think it sounds like we would probably want to do that now.  Do your knees ever swell up or anything?

PATIENT X393:	It swells.  But like I said it has been popping.  I just consider myself a tough person.  It has just gotten to the point where now I feel like I @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.

PATIENT X393:	The knee will swell, @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	No pain down the legs.

PATIENT X393:	I have a little.  I got pain in this hip now and this hip popping.  

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.  Does your hip hurt right in here?

PATIENT X393:	Yeah, when it pops, like my knee popping it hurts.  @@@.  It hurts.  

DOCTOR X393: 	Do you get pain in like over going down here to your groin area.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.  My mother told me but to be honest with you @@@ told me that.  @@@ About four or five months ago and @@@.  @@@ months and months ago since I pulled that.  Sometimes I get back spasms.  I am okay if I move and don't pull anything.  But my back spasms and it kind of is irritating.

DOCTOR X393:  I mean.  A lot of this.  It is not because of the knee.  These things seem to happen and are more common as we get older.  You know.  @@@.  You are going to start having some of these things.  Some of them we will be able to do something about to make it a little bit better.  I don't know that you are going to feel like you did when you were 24, you know?  But we will try to @@@.

PATIENT X393:	What could it possibly be @@@?

DOCTOR X393:	So the hips.  Does it hurt, is this where it is from?

PATIENT X393:	In my hips it is over this area here.

DOCTOR X393: 	When I push here?

PATIENT X393:	That is the worst pain.

DOCTOR X393: 	That is the spot.

PATIENT X393:	Not really, more @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Yeah okay.  You do get pains shooting towards the groin.  When I push in here does that cause that pain?

PATIENT X393:	No that is not.  It is mild right now.

DOCTOR X393:	@@@.  Does it hurt when I do that?  @@@.  Does that hurt a little bit?

PATIENT X393:	No.

DOCTOR X393: 	So actually @@@.  Does that cause pain around here?  There are a couple of things.  The first thing is there are a lot of muscles attached to the bone and a little bit up here in the muscle attach up here and the muscles sliding against each other.  There is nothing in between to help like cushion the blow to help kind of lubricate it, @@@.  There is a shock, the knee rubbing against bone and it will eventually tear.  There are things called bursas, which are little are a little forward and go back. @@@. There is a big bursa right there.  Especially if you are having knee pain and may be not walking totally normally to compensate, people start getting pain in the bursa.  That was the first thing I was thinking.  That tender you know.  The pain that goes to the groin is sometimes from inside the hip.  May be we will take a picture of your hip too @@@.  All right?   I think we will start with an antiinflammatory medicine.  I am thinking this one called naproxen, Naprosyn. 	Does it help when you take it?

PATIENT X393:	To be honest with you I took it for a while but like I said at the time @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Well my thought is let's do it for two to three weeks.  One in the morning, and one as needed @@@ and then we will see how you are doing at the end of that.

PATIENT X393:	What did you decide @@@?

DOCTOR X393: 	Taking it long-term, it is an antiinflammatory medicine.  It should work like ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin.  Long-term it can cause problems with your stomach.  If you take a lot for a long time.  We are not going to do a high dose and not take it for a long time.  I am not really too worried about that.  It can affect your kidneys if you take many of though.  So if you have a bad day, you can take @@@ of them, the maximum of people that use them.  As long as you take them like you are supposed to there is no harm to your kidneys.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Something we want to watch out for.  By themselves they are not really @@@.  Just remember to take them with @@@. Hmm, otherwise no problems?

PATIENT X393:	No.

DOCTOR X393: 	Your blood pressure is a little borderline.  No one has ever told you that you have high blood pressure or anything?  Right?

PATIENT X393:	No.  

DOCTOR X393:  	All right.  Nothing for us to do about it today but we will measure it the next time and if it is high again we have to start thinking about may be putting you on a low-dose blood pressure medicine.  The first time it is kind of borderline anyway and I don't think there is anything to do.  Just something that you need to know about.  Then, just some questions, the nurses asked you these and some were positive.  Did you ever have any thoughts about taking your life or committing suicide?

PATIENT X393:	It has been a while but not recently.

DOCTOR X393: 	When was it?  

PATIENT X393:	May be a year ago or so.

DOCTOR X393: 	Did you have a plan at that time?  A way you would have done it?

PATIENT X393:	I always have a plan of doing things.

DOCTOR X393: 	What was your plan?

PATIENT X393:	To be truthful I would jump in front of a train. @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Yeah.  That is even worse if it doesn’t kill you.

PATIENT X393:	That is my point @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Have you ever attempted suicide?

PATIENT X393:	No.

DOCTOR X393: 	So right now you feel that this is not something that you are worried about?

PATIENT X393:	Sometimes I feel depressed, something is just not right.

DOCTOR X393: 	What makes you say that?  

PATIENT X393:	My whole being.  Everything about me.  Something is off.  @@@  Nothing but depression.

DOCTOR X393:	Okay.

PATIENT X393:	Kind of like a shocking me.

DOCTOR X393:	Okay.  Um what is your reason?  You tell me.  What are the symptoms that you have read @@@?

PATIENT X393:	I don't have a lot of energy.  I'm still aggravated a lot.  It doesn't take a whole lot to get me upset.  You know.  A lot of times I try not to reveal a lot. @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	How about, you feel you don't enjoy the things in life that you used to enjoy?

PATIENT X393:	No I don't enjoy much.  Right now my life is not at that point where I wanted to be.  @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Do you have trouble sleeping at night?

PATIENT X393:	No.

DOCTOR X393:	How about eating?  Is your appetite the same?  Less?  Eating more?

PATIENT X393:	Like I said @@@ and I gained weight and then my knees starting hurting more.  I realized @@@ that I can gain weight.  I realized the more I do is more painful on that side. @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Um.  I agree it does sound like maybe you are having some issues with depression.  Other than the pain and that affecting your life, are there other things at home that are affecting you?

PATIENT X393:	No. @@@ I got an apartment.  @@@.  I got to get my @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Anything that the VA can help you with?  Anything we can do?

PATIENT X393:	I told them I wanted to go back to school, so I supposed to be going to school @@@. I feel I need to do that.  @@@.  They gave me a disability rating.  I have never been paid or anything.  I went back down @@@ back to the doctor and really I would like to find out what is wrong @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	We will do that.  That part I can try to help you with. I can try to make it better @@@, make you feel a little bit better @@@.  Um and we already talked about you don't want to take any medicines.  @@@.

PATIENT X393:	I don't really want to take medicines.

DOCTOR X393: 	I don't necessarily go that route.  It is something we can do if we want to.  At some point now or at some point.

PATIENT X393:	@@@ medicines.  I am particularly worried about the side effects.

DOCTOR X393:	Yeah.  Antidepressant medicine although some of them can be very helpful, definitely have side effects.  Some of them will cause weight gain, some cause sexual dysfunction.  There are not many serious side effects from some of the newer ones that are.  They are pretty good.  But there are some of them that can definitely affect your life and you know makes it difficult.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	I certainly don't want to put you on anything to sedate you or anything like that.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	No, no, now.  I think if you were @@@ antidepressant medications @@@.

PATIENT X393:	@@@ like I said I want to be me personally @@@. I mean I don’t mind doing something.  But I would like to find out personally what this is actually doing.  I don't feel like I am @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Absolutely.

PATIENT X393:	That is what I am really terrified of @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	What we do is that we start out with one of the newest ones, it is called SSRI.  Prozac is one of the early ones.  We will try one of those.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	We will start with a low dose and you can try that for a while and see how you are feeling?  If you are not having any side effects we can then go up slowly.

PATIENT X393:	I got a question.  

DOCTOR X393: 	Yeah.

PATIENT X393:	How will I know?

DOCTOR X393: 	How will you know if you are feeling better?

PATIENT X393:	You know as far as…

DOCTOR X393: 	You know I can't answer that for you.  I don't know for sure.  I know that I have seen somebody from personal experience.  Like my Mom has one of them that worked for her.  She has some depression for the last 40 years and finally found one that worked for her and she is like a new person.  So it just depends.  @@@ what is going on at home.  @@@.  So @@@, but @@@.  It is something you can always try.  If you feel like it is having side effects, making you feel like you you don’t want to feel, you can stop it.

PATIENT X393:	Okay.

DOCTOR X393: 	So is that something you wanted to try now.

PATIENT X393:	Yeah, I am willing.

DOCTOR X393: 	@@@.  We will do it.  We will give it a shot.  We will work on that.  @@@.  Also I am asking about a certain amount of stress?  Is this about the experiences you had in the war?  @@@.  Do you think your depression is related to that.

PATIENT X393:	Now.

DOCTOR X393:	A lot of people have problems with post-traumatic stress disorder, may be @@@ at home more and it is very difficult, somewhat difficult, not difficult.

PATIENT X393:	To be honest with you.  I wasn't in the war zone.

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.

PATIENT X393:	But like I said.  I don’t know what the hell is going on with me. @@@.  @@@ always hurting.  @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Okay.

PATIENT X393:	Get the opportunity to come down here, so they know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	So, okay and that is normal.  That is normal @@@.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	We need to do a few things.  We need to check your blood pressure today and check your @@@ okay?

PATIENT X393:	Do this now?

DOCTOR X393: 	We are getting all this going.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	Oh yeah.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR X393: 	All right.  So @@@. We will start on fluoxetine @@@.  It is the trade name. @@@.  Um we will start with a low-dose and we will start that for a while and see how it is doing, if you have any side effects.  @@@.  It usually takes 4-6 weeks before you feel the affect.  It kind of @@@.  At that point we will plan on having you back and see how you are feeling.  If you don't feel anything and not any side effects, then we will try a higher dose.  If at that point you still don't feel anything we will either try another medicine.

PATIENT X393:	No.  I really don't want to @@@.

DOCTOR X393:  I know.  That this is going to happen and you know you are going to know.  In about six weeks you should feel a little bit different.  What it does is it changes some of the hormones in your body.  There are things that go to your brain.  Like the happy side of your brain.  @@@.  Because we think that a lot of depression is related to the @@@ and that can be part of the depression.  So, you really will start feeling different.  You will start doing the things that you enjoy all the time, but you know it is different in everybody.  So, that is why we will start this.  If you are having side effects on it.  If you have any problems you can stop it, that is okay.  It does not interact with the medicine for pain, so that is not a problem.  So is there anything about it that makes you uncomfortable you can stop it and you can come back in. @@@.  You want to pick it up at the pharmacy today?

PATIENT X393:	You said one pill a day.

DOCTOR X393: 	One pill a day.  @@@.  The other medicine is naproxen a low-dose 1 in the morning and 1 at night for a couple of weeks.  Then I would like to see you back. @@@.

PATIENT X393:	@@@.

DOCTOR OUT:  31:32   DOCTOR IN: 
 
DOCTOR X393:	@@@ Okay.  So you know where everything is?

PATIENT X393:	No.  

DOCTOR X393: 	@@@.  Trying to think of what the best order is.  I don't know if you take a number and then go @@@.  The Pharmacy is over there.  The Lab and Radiology are kind of right next to each other. @@@ Right across the hall.  @@@.  Give them your last four and they will give you a number and they will @@@ you.  Right next to it is the hallway and then you sign up with Radiology.  @@@.  @@@ get an x-ray.

PATIENT X393:	Probably best to go to the Lab?

DOCTOR X393: 	I don't know what the best order is.  You can try to get the number for the Pharmacy and then get a number for Radiology. I don't know how that works.  I am not sure.  I don't know exactly the best way to do it.  @@@.  The Lab closes at 4:30.  So you want to make sure you get to them first.  The Pharmacy doesn't close until @@@.  Then just stop at the desk up from and they will make you an appointment and I will see you @@@ and see how things are going.  Good luck.  @@@.


Times is 3:35.

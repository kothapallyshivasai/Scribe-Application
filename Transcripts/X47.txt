DOCTOR X47
Are you PATIENT?

PATIENT X47
Yes I am.  @@@.

DOCTOR X47
You bet.

PATIENT X47
@@@.

DOCTOR X47
@@@.  

PATIENT X47
As a matter of fact yes.  I was here three years ago for @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
And uh I haven't been back since but now I'm on your records because to make a long story short, @@@ nothing really hurts okay but what I'm trying to do is get myself moved over to the VA because my wife is retiring at the end of this week and by the end of the month I will be without prescriptions.

DOCTOR X47
Right okay.  Sounds fine.

PATIENT X47
Now I do have a list of things that I do take in case you want to see them.

DOCTOR X47
Now um, do have a primary care physician?

PATIENT X47
I do.  I have this pump and @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Are you going to transfer everything here or are you going to keep your outside primary care physician?

PATIENT X47
Yeah that's why I'm here.  I really am between a rock and a hard place.  I've known this guy for 33 years.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
He's a good guy.  My wife left off papers to him okay.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
I'll do whatever I have to do in order to get covered on the VA I'll do it.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  The only reason I want to know specific, I know who's going to be coordinating your health care.

PATIENT X47
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X47
Cause it's important that if you want just one person, so whether that's us or the other @@@ that's up to you.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
I want you to just have one person just so it's not two people putting in orders.

PATIENT X47
I can do that.  So what if I go to him for whatever reason and he gives me a prescription?

DOCTOR X47
You can get it here.

PATIENT X47
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X47
Then you're primary.  If I'm understanding about this, you plan is to come here from your physician and come here for medications which other people have done as well.

PATIENT X47
Okay, let's try that, it'll work.  Why don't we go that way.

DOCTOR X47
And if you want to transition your care here then @@@.

PATIENT X47
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
Exactly, you read my mind, right into my questions.

DOCTOR X47
Um alright, let me get some of the history from you just so that.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
You @@@.  

PATIENT X47
So you identified yourself as DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X47
Yeah that's my first name, because my last name is DOCTOR.

PATIENT X47
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X47
DOCTOR.  

PATIENT X47
Oh it ends with a K, okay.

DOCTOR X47
It's @@@.

PATIENT X47
I wasn't expect to see such a young doctor.

DOCTOR X47
Alright.

PATIENT X47
Usually older than me or about my age.

DOCTOR X47
Now I have to document a couple of things.

PATIENT X47
@@@ yeah.

DOCTOR X47
So what medications are you taking?

PATIENT X47
Okay I take Diovan for high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and how much of the Diovan?

PATIENT X47
One 160 mg once a day.  That's it.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
Yeah.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and why are you taking the Diovan as opposed to @@@ lisinopril in the past and one @@@.

PATIENT X47
That's what we did.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  Just because so this is a system medication.

PATIENT X47
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X47
Um for the @@@ can be resistive to other medicines.

PATIENT X47
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X47
Usually people do well on the other medications @@@ what happens.  Did you ever have a cough with the medication and he said stop that?

PATIENT X47
No I had something before Diovan.  To be honest with you it was so long ago I don't remember but the Diovan has been working for me and I'm not wanting to give it up, that's why I'm on it.

DOCTOR X47
Oh @@@.

PATIENT X47
@@@ yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and that's his number right there.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
And who else do you see?

PATIENT X47
I'm not sure I can remember.  But recently the dental, I just have to get my file and I just pulled them out so I could give you the information that I use.

DOCTOR X47
So I can take that right?

PATIENT X47
@@@ particular @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Yes, this is the one.

PATIENT X47
Same one?

DOCTOR X47
You let me know.

PATIENT X47
But some of them could be different, I just want to make sure that I remember to @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Yeah @@@ absolutely.  Okay, so we got the Diovan and what else are you taking?

PATIENT X47
@@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
For cholesterol and DOCTOR prescribed the Lipitor.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and you're taking vitamin C.

PATIENT X47
Vitamin C yeah.

DOCTOR X47
Okay @@@.

PATIENT X47
And sometimes @@@ muscle relaxant, @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
@@@ muscle relaxer, sometimes my back kind of @@@ up.

DOCTOR X47
How long do you take that?

PATIENT X47
Uh only when my back goes out.  @@@ been for a long time so, probably within the last eight months or nine months.  I only take it when I need it.  I don't take medications if I don't have to.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X47
And the last thing is I take eye drops, @@@.  I have @@@.  I don't think I have @@@ small container @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  No problem.  Now okay.  And this goes in both eyes?

PATIENT X47
Yes one drop in each eye just once a day.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and that was the last one.

PATIENT X47
That's it.

DOCTOR X47
What's the first one?

PATIENT X47
@@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
Yeah I go through an ophthalmologist in @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Alrighty.  Okay.  Anything else or is that it?

PATIENT X47
No that's it.  @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Yeah some people take a lot more.

PATIENT X47
@@@.

DOCTOR X47
Have you had any surgeries in the past?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  And then are you allergic to anything?

PATIENT X47
Not that I know of.  No.  Sulfa or anything like that no.

DOCTOR X47
Okay um and it as far as your family history goes, are your parents still alive?

PATIENT X47
No mother's dead and father's dead.

DOCTOR X47
May I asked what they passed from?

PATIENT X47
Uh my father, I think he died of a heart attack.  He was 73 years old.  He had open heart surgery when he was 60.  He had two bypasses.  He smoked a lot, he drank a lot and he did a lot of things that he shouldn't have done and uh, so you know when his time came he went to the hospital to be checked out and he was at xxx.

DOCTOR X47
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X47
And then @@@ someplace and @@@.  He was in for observation and the next thing he died of a heart attack and my mother died at 86, old age.  @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X47
My mother she was a type 2 diabetic.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
And I never knew her to take any kind of heart medications.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
She took eye drops for probably glaucoma but.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  Do you have any brothers or sisters?

PATIENT X47
I have two sisters.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  Do they have any medical conditions?

PATIENT X47
My sister SISTER she had cancer of the lung way back when.  She's fine now and she had something with her hip and you know all kinds of things and I don't know what kinds of medications she's on, God only knows. 

DOCTOR X47
And the other one?

PATIENT X47
My other sister she takes probably an aspirin a year and she's on very minimal, maybe eye drops @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
Very limited but she smokes, that's the only problem she's got.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  Did you have children?

PATIENT X47
I have one.  He's going to be 40 the 26th of this month.

DOCTOR X47
And @@@.

PATIENT X47
Yes.

DOCTOR X47
And who lives with you?

PATIENT X47
My wife.

DOCTOR X47
And do you um do you work sir?

PATIENT X47
No I'm retired.  I've been retired almost four years in June.

DOCTOR X47
And what did you used to do?

PATIENT X47
@@@.  

DOCTOR X47
Hmm.

PATIENT X47
Tell them what they want to hear.

DOCTOR X47
And do you smoke?

PATIENT X47
No I do not.  I quit about 20 years ago.  Do I drink; you know occasional cocktail and stuff.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  And any other @@@ uh like illicit drugs or @@@.

PATIENT X47
No, no, no.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  This is just a laundry list of questions @@@.

PATIENT X47
Fine.

DOCTOR X47
Any weight changes?

PATIENT X47
No.  In a matter of fact, I was doing better well until Christmas you know, I was losing eight or nine pounds in August.

DOCTOR X47
I see.

PATIENT X47
The fluid.  @@@.

DOCTOR X47
And @@@.

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Any chest pain?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Or palpitations or racing of the heart?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
And um, how many pillows do you sleep on at night?

PATIENT X47
That's a good question.  You know when I was in the Navy they gave me pillows and I'd get down almost to the mattress.  I only sleep on one pillow and I hug the other and I have one between my legs.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
The reason I do that is because it helps my back.

DOCTOR X47
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X47
It's a knee pillow.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
The other pillow I hold to and my @@@ but and then I sleep on one pillow.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  And you don't wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air?

PATIENT X47
Uh no, but once in a while I maybe have a tickle and it doesn't happen every night but it happens from time to time, I think it's just dry air in the bedroom.

DOCTOR X47
And you'll cough?

PATIENT X47
Yes, I mean not anything going crazy.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
Cough a little bit, if I need to I'll get some water and that takes care of and I'll go right back to sleep.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and you cough up any blood?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
If I ever do that, I'd be knocking on somebody's door, I don't play games with stuff like that.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and any nausea or vomiting?  

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Any constipation or diarrhea?

PATIENT X47
No.  @@@

DOCTOR X47
Any blood in your stool?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
And any @@@?

PATIENT X47
No, @@@ but I don't know.

DOCTOR X47
Yeah okay. Alright and then as far as um what you've had in the past.  Have you had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X47
Uh never.

DOCTOR X47
And why not?

PATIENT X47
Because my @@@ told me that I probably shouldn't, cause you know if you're over 65, which I am uh you know you should probably go in for it but uh I never, but my primary doctor he finally you know gives me the finger every.

DOCTOR X47
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X47
Whether or not, @@@ right now is that everything looks and feels good so he didn't think there was an urgent need for it.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  Have you ever done the stool cards?

PATIENT X47
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X47
Do you do that once a year?

PATIENT X47
Uh as a matter of fact I just did one not too long ago, probably in July or August.

DOCTOR X47
Okay and that was normal?

PATIENT X47
It was fine yeah.

DOCTOR X47
Has there ever been blood in your stool?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  And then they probably, you can do either one; you can do the stool cards once a year or get a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X47
I mean he's a really good guy, very thorough and you know if @@@ knock me out and stick me in the hospital but you know, he told me @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay, alright.  I understand.  Um has he been checking your @@@?

PATIENT X47
Oh yeah he checks it probably once a year.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
@@@.

DOCTOR X47
@@@ just so I can have those results as well.  @@@ the cholesterol medication.

PATIENT X47
Yeah.

DOCTOR X47
But you know @@@ the goal.  I mean if we're not I can always recommend something and you go back to him and say here, do you think I should go off of it and use this.

PATIENT X47
Oh okay.  I understand that.

DOCTOR X47
But just so that we can @@@.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
@@@ back to me.

PATIENT X47
And what if like I say do you have to @@@ over a year and then I could get another or no?

DOCTOR X47
Yeah.  Because if you're taking cholesterol medications.

PATIENT X47
Yes.  You make sure the blood work and everything else to make sure.

DOCTOR X47
Exactly.  Exactly and that would be helpful to have.

PATIENT X47
You bet, uh-huh.  That makes sense.

DOCTOR X47
Um and have you checked your PSA?

PATIENT X47
Uh yes he does that quite often, @@@.  Now I @@@ people ask, some mean old guy I don't like to see them, I don't want to hear anything about him.

DOCTOR X47
Right.

PATIENT X47
But I do know from the test that I went through this one operation at xxx xxx not too long ago and whatever they did they took out a big vial this one time and this other one was piggyback and they keep on taking out vials and I hear a click and @@@.  After a while @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
Makes me go crazy.  So yeah the PSA is one of them.  There are seven things that they check for and that's one of them, that's one of them.

DOCTOR X47
And did you have flu vaccine?

PATIENT X47
Yes I did.

DOCTOR X47
When was that, what month?

PATIENT X47
Uh let's see, it was getting more cold out, it was at xxx xxx and I had just seen my doctor, I went through @@@.  They said it was free but it wasn't free, they put it on Medicare, @@@ it definitely was probably September October.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
Yeah.

DOCTOR X47
And do you know when your last tetanus shot was?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Would have been more than ten years ago?

PATIENT X47
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  That would definitely be something we'd ask you to get.  

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
@@@.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
And have you had a Pneumovax or the pneumonia shot?

PATIENT X47
No.  I never had the pneumonia shot, never in my lift.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  If this is something that you want to have, you just get one and then you don't need it anymore the rest of your life.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
So you may consider that.

PATIENT X47
Oh okay, okay.  That's @@@.

DOCTOR X47
@@@ you don't need one.  Okay, why don't we examine you, how about that?  Go ahead and roll up your sleeve.  Do you check your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT X47
Uh I have one of those wrist things.

DOCTOR X47
Yeah.

PATIENT X47
Yeah.

DOCTOR X47
What do they usually run?

PATIENT X47
Uh 120/81, 130, sometimes it gets something crazy like 119/75, you know they fluctuate and my doctor doesn't think it's all that great but you know it keeps me in line.  I think that she had 150/80 but I probably get excited when I'm around new people you know.

DOCTOR X47
Can you bring your um sleeve up a little bit please.

PATIENT X47
Bring it up or take it off?

DOCTOR X47
Um either way I just want to, need to get the blood pressure.

PATIENT X47
I should have wore a short sleeve today.

DOCTOR X47
No that's fine.

PATIENT X47
If that doesn't work I'll take it off.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  I'm going to have you @@@.  Then I'll put the left one on my arm.

PATIENT X47
How it be hard @@@ your doing.

DOCTOR X47
Focused and relaxed.  I don't want you; you're holding your arm up.  I want you to drop it.

PATIENT X47
Okay, yeah.

DOCTOR X47
Pretty good, 136/88.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
Not as high as the nurses reading.

PATIENT X47
She said 150.

DOCTOR X47
Yes.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
And like you said it can fluctuate.

PATIENT X47
Yeah, right okay.

DOCTOR X47
Especially just walking in.

PATIENT X47
Definitely walking.

DOCTOR X47
@@@ but it's high.

PATIENT X47
Well at least you know I'm telling the truth.

DOCTOR X47
Let me take a listen to your heart and breathe normal.  Deep breath in and out good.  Again and out, again out in and out.  Good.  Can you take your glasses off for me.  I'm going to look in your eyes.  Look here at my nose, uh-huh, uh-huh, good.  Open your mouth real big, ah.  You can put your glasses back on.  @@@ push me away; good now push me away with your legs, good.  I want you to look at your ceiling like that, good.  @@@ good.  Go ahead and lie down.  I'll check your abdomen.  There you go.  

PATIENT X47
I'm ticklish.

DOCTOR X47
You're ticklish. 

PATIENT X47
I'm already lying down.

DOCTOR X47
I'll try not to tickle you then.  I usually tickle ornery patients.  Any swelling in the legs?

PATIENT X47
No.

DOCTOR X47
Good.  I'll help you get up.  @@@.  Alrighty so now.  @@@ with the medication, I'm going to start the Diovan.

PATIENT X47
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X47
Then I need to, @@@ some of the medications we don't have on our formulary or it's not in the @@@ and we have to order @@@.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
Let me see if they have the Diovan, they do.  @@@.  Is that one today?  

PATIENT X47
Yes.

DOCTOR X47
Do you want it mailed to you or do you want it?

PATIENT X47
That's a good question uh what's easier.  Are they hard to mail?

DOCTOR X47
Usually people prefer to have them mailed because.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
Because the Pharmacy down here can be backed up.

PATIENT X47
Okay, a friend of mine comes here quite often and I've seen her a couple of times when I go with her and there's a lot of people and yeah.

DOCTOR X47
So what I can also do are three months supple with three refills, @@@ a year.

PATIENT X47
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X47
And @@@.

PATIENT X47
Uh.

DOCTOR X47
@@@.

PATIENT X47
It's 20/5 @@@. Or 5/20 it's 5 of the Norvasc and 20 mg on the Lipitor, that's how you get the 5/20.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  Um but we don't have the @@@ in our formulary.  What we have to do is go from one pills to two pills.

PATIENT X47
Lipitor and the Norvasc.

DOCTOR X47
@@@.  So the Norvasc we'll go with 5.

PATIENT X47
Go with 5 yeah.

DOCTOR X47
And @@@ the Lipitor.

PATIENT X47
20. 20 mg.

DOCTOR X47
And then @@@.

PATIENT X47
Cyclobenzaprine.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.  @@@.  We don't have that so what we have is pravastatin but I don't know @@@.  And so @@@.  Lipitor is in the same family as pravastatin but Lipitor is a @@@ pravastatin and simvastatin.  

PATIENT X47
Hmm.

DOCTOR X47
So I can give you one of those alternate drugs but @@@ from atorvastatin to pravastatin.

PATIENT X47
Okay now @@@ I don't know you know.

DOCTOR X47
We'll order simvastatin.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
Based on recent studies, @@@ simvastatin.

PATIENT X47
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X47
So we'll order that.  @@@.

PATIENT X47
@@@.  

DOCTOR X47
Norvasc @@@

PATIENT X47
And what do you call the other medicine?

DOCTOR X47
Simvastatin.

PATIENT X47
Simvastatin.  Okay.

DOCTOR X47
Oh the @@@.

PATIENT X47
@@@ yeah 10 mg.

DOCTOR X47
And how many do you usually have?

PATIENT X47
Usually we're prescribed 21, a seven day supply three times a day and I never really, I can't remember the last time I took 21.

DOCTOR X47
Okay, no problem.

PATIENT X47
Uh I'm really bad but I really should finish it up because once my back goes out it gets kind of crooked.

DOCTOR X47
I understand.

PATIENT X47
You @@@.

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
@@@.

DOCTOR X47
Oh @@@.

PATIENT X47

DOCTOR X47
Okay.

PATIENT X47
But anyway when it @@@ I try not to laugh @@@.  She has a good time with it; I tell her one of these days God is going to punish her.

DOCTOR X47
And the last thing is the eye doctor.

PATIENT X47
@@@.

DOCTOR X47
Now I don't know if you want to have that @@@.  So I'm gonna have to step out and see what, cause I got the notes from xxx so I need to see what alternatives we can do um instead of the @@@ and I'm going to order those @@@ and be right back okay.

PATIENT X47
Okay.

DOCTOR X47
@@@.

PATIENT X47

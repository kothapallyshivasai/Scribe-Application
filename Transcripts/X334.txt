DOCTOR X334
PATIENT?  How are you today?

PATIENT X334
Fine, fine.  Better.

DOCTOR X334
It is.  We need to go down this way.  @@@ Is it getting windy outside?

PATIENT X334
Uh it was a little bit.

DOCTOR X334
Little bit.  Well it's clearing up.

PATIENT X334
Yeah uh-huh.  It's going to come later.

DOCTOR X334
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
How are things going?

PATIENT X334
Uh fine.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
Uh no complaints.

DOCTOR X334
Good.

PATIENT X334
I'm feeling very well.

DOCTOR X334
Good.

PATIENT X334
Uh I need uh.

DOCTOR X334
Some refills.

PATIENT X334
Some refills yeah.

DOCTOR X334
Yep.

PATIENT X334
And I brought a list of my medications.

DOCTOR X334
Good, let's take a look.

PATIENT X334
And I have one question.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
One of them.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
I'm uh you know daily on the lovastatin.

DOCTOR X334
Right.

PATIENT X334
Triamterene.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
And the potassium supplements.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.  Yep.

PATIENT X334
However, when my prescription comes they have a warning.

DOCTOR X334
Yep.

PATIENT X334
For people who take triamterene.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
Uh saying that it can raise your body's potassium level.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
And do not use potassium supplements if you're taking triamterene.

DOCTOR X334
Right and that is something that it causes normally but your potassium, even with the supplement is low.

PATIENT X334
Okay.

DOCTOR X334
So we're watching that.

PATIENT X334
Okay.

DOCTOR X334
We have our eye out for it.

PATIENT X334
Okay.

DOCTOR X334
But we, if your potassium drops too low it's bad for your heart.

PATIENT X334
Yeah.

DOCTOR X334
So we have to keep an eye on it.

PATIENT X334
Uh I.

DOCTOR X334
So we do check it with every lab we do with you but so far this is what it's saying so we're gonna stay on it.

PATIENT X334
And I eat a banana every day.

DOCTOR X334
Good.

PATIENT X334
@@@.

DOCTOR X334
That's fine.  Just don't eat like 12 yeah.  Cause that would be bad.  Yeah all the lab today is perfect.

PATIENT X334
Uh.

DOCTOR X334
And then what else is going on?

PATIENT X334
Okay.

DOCTOR X334
The aspirin you're taking low dose.  Do you get it through us?

PATIENT X334
Uh no.

DOCTOR X334
Do you want to?  I don't know what the cost difference would be but we could try if you want.  I can write this for you and I can write the multivitamin for you.

PATIENT X334
Uh.

DOCTOR X334
Or do you prefer to get them yourself?

PATIENT X334
I can get them myself.

DOCTOR X334
Okay, that's fine.

PATIENT X334
Uh I will need the lovastatin renewed.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
Because I have about ten tablets let.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.  Do you want to pick it up downstairs or do you want us to mail to you.

PATIENT X334
Um you can send it in the mail.

DOCTOR X334
Okay let's do that now so we don't forget.  Now what's the dose you're taking now?

PATIENT X334
Uh the lovastatin.

DOCTOR X334
Do you take 40?

PATIENT X334
40 mg.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.  You want 90 day supply?

PATIENT X334
A 90 day supply yeah.

DOCTOR X334
Wonderful.  

PATIENT X334
Uh but my cholesterol is in good shape?

DOCTOR X334
Yeah I was just looking at that before you walked in.  So your cholesterol, your total cholesterol is 195 uh your good cholesterol is 50 so that's really good and we want it above 40.  So diet, exercise, that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X334
Right.

DOCTOR X334
And then your LDL is 103 and you're not a diabetic and so a man your age with high blood pressure should be below 100 cause you're right at that cusp.

PATIENT X334
Right.

DOCTOR X334
At 100.  So I mean we're kind of sitting where we need to at this point.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
So it's good okay.  Um and then I was looking at your other labs so your potassium, like I told you, it's even on like the low end of normal even with the supplement.

PATIENT X334
Right.

DOCTOR X334
So we're okay with staying with what we're doing.  The kidney function is good.  Your fasting glucose was really good.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
That means you're not like pre-diabetic or anything like that.

PATIENT X334
Right every time it's been tested it's at 90 so.

DOCTOR X334
Yes.

PATIENT X334
So what did it do this time?

DOCTOR X334
It was 95.

PATIENT X334
95.

DOCTOR X334
Yes, yes and then um and then I checked your liver enzymes cause people that are on statin for a long time you just want to monitor.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
To see how the liver is doing and those are totally normal.  Um and then.

PATIENT X334
And then uh last year I took the uh oral anti-fungal for 90 days.

DOCTOR X334
Oh yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X334
So there was concern that that would uh.

DOCTOR X334
Damage your liver.

PATIENT X334
That injures my liver yeah.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah no so those are perfect.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
Uh that resulted in all the toenails to lose the fungus.

DOCTOR X334
Oh good.  Good and we're done with that right?

PATIENT X334
Right, right.

DOCTOR X334
You're done with the whole, okay good.  Good and then we also checked your, what we call a CBC which is like the white blood cell count, the hemoglobin and your platelets and those are all normal.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
So we don't have to worry about anemia or anything like that.

PATIENT X334
Right but before I had high levels of triglycerides, is that?

DOCTOR X334
Yeah so your triglycerides are pretty high but we want you around 150 and you're at 200.  Um have you ever taken like niacin?

PATIENT X334
Uh well I take a multivitamin.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
And that has niacin in it.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah but niacin itself is probably a little bit stronger.  We can try niacin and see how you respond to it and recheck them in like three months um.

PATIENT X334
What causes the triglycerides to be so high?

DOCTOR X334
A lot of it is genetics and then some of its diet so you know a high fat diet can cause you to have a lot of triglycerides.

PATIENT X334
I'm on a low fat diet.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes it's genetic so kind of take care of it.

PATIENT X334
Uh but alcohol would elevate it?

DOCTOR X334
Alcohol can absolutely.  Let me see where they were before.  Yeah I mean you were at 219 before, you're 209 now.  You've always been around 200.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
So I'm guessing it's more of a, yeah it's more of a genetic component.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
Cause your diet seems like it's pretty good, from the last time we talked.  So good.  So yeah I mean you can try niacin.  I can give it to you through the VA.  Is this a B vitamin?

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
And the side effects of that is some people get flushing.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
Like they just feel very hot and red.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
And then after that we could see doing a slow-release niacin.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
You know a slower acting for your systems, kind of a tablet that's slower.  Do you want to try it?

PATIENT X334
I'll try that uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.  Let's go ahead and do that and then we'll recheck everything in a couple of months.  90 day supply, see how you tolerate it.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
I'd say about maybe 15% of people have that reaction so, hopefully you won't.  Okay um and what about your other medicines, the cholesterol pill?

PATIENT X334
Uh my potassium supplement I got a 60 day supply left.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
And no refills.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
So maybe I need it.

DOCTOR X334
We'll do that and then I'll give you enough refills.  How's your blood pressure been doing in the last year?

PATIENT X334
Uh it's been fine.  I have uh a device I use on my wrist to measure it.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
But uh it gives me fairly high readings and the device is inaccurate.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
Uh when they tested the blood pressure I was about 112/72.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah this number is really good.

PATIENT X334
Which is.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
I'm getting 145/90.

DOCTOR X334
Oh really.

PATIENT X334
When I test at home.

DOCTOR X334
Do you want a different um monitor?  I can order you one from the VA.

PATIENT X334
How much is that gonna cost?

DOCTOR X334
I don't think it costs very much at all and you just pick it up downstairs in the Prosthetics Department.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
On your way out.  Do you want that?

PATIENT X334
I bought this thing and I paid 90 some dollars for it.

DOCTOR X334
It's definitely less than that.  I do feel this one is going to be pretty inaccurate.

PATIENT X334
I think so.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah so I mean you can go pick up one at Walgreens.  I prefer you get the cuff or I can order one through the VA which is probably cheaper for you.  I'm not exactly sure how much they charge but.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
When you go pick it up you can ask them and if you don't want it.

PATIENT X334
Right.

DOCTOR X334
Then don't take it.

PATIENT X334
Right, right.

DOCTOR X334
Do you want to do that at least?

PATIENT X334
I'll try it.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
Alright because I repeat the tests on the wrist and a couple of minutes later the figure is all different.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.  Those things aren't reliable.

PATIENT X334
It's a general estimation though.

DOCTOR X334
Yes.  The potassium needed some refills too.  This was followed up in November.  You were just taking potassium and chloride okay.  So we also this time checked your prostate.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
To see what your prostate hormone was doing and it's a little bit elevated.  Has anyone ever told you that before?

PATIENT X334
Uh no.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.  Cause I know you, let's see you started following here at the VA a couple of years ago or was it how long ago?

PATIENT X334
Uh it's almost two years.

DOCTOR X334
Two years okay.  No one's ever checked here at the VA so I don't know what your records were on the outside.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
Um but it's a little bit elevated so it's a little concerning.  Cause it could be many different things and most likely it's probably the gland itself just gets bigger as you age.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
Um and that's what most people you know end up having a high PSA.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
It can also be, if it's really, really high, it can also be prostate cancer um but yours isn't to that level at this point.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
But I still want to keep an eye on it and probably send you to see the urology doctors.

PATIENT X334
Okay.

DOCTOR X334
Okay, just for them to kind of keep an eye on things.

PATIENT X334
Okay.

DOCTOR X334
To watch it a little bit closer.  Are you having any urinary symptoms at home like when you wake up at night and have to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT X334
Uh I've had uh you know frequent and urgent urination for a long time.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
Uh I think probably it's due to the blood pressure medication.

DOCTOR X334
Okay yeah since it's a diuretic.

PATIENT X334
It's a diuretic.

DOCTOR X334
Right, right.

PATIENT X334
Uh I take the blood pressure medications in the morning.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
Now if I take it at night I have to get up.

DOCTOR X334
Get up.

PATIENT X334
In the night.

DOCTOR X334
If you take it in the morning how often do you get up at night to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT X334
Uh I don't have to get up at night.

DOCTOR X334
You don't have to get up.  Do you ever have to um kind of go to the bathroom multiple times in a row to empty your bladder fully?

PATIENT X334
Not really no.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.  Do you ever feel like it takes a while for you to start a urine stream or it just won't come out?

PATIENT X334
No, no.

DOCTOR X334
Okay, okay, so yeah we'll just you know, we'll have you go to the urology doctors and have them kind of take a look at it okay.

PATIENT X334
Yeah.

DOCTOR X334
It's a good thing to catch early.

PATIENT X334
Yeah.

DOCTOR X334
So @@@.

PATIENT X334
And I also see a dermatologist.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
She's very good.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
Uh she has tried to do something for my lip.  Uh the first that she wanted me to try.

DOCTOR X334
Like a prescription.

PATIENT X334
Is a 2.5% cream.

DOCTOR X334
Uh.

PATIENT X334
It really has no effect.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
My lip won't heal.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.  What happened there?

PATIENT X334
Uh I had surgery to remove a very large growth.

DOCTOR X334
Oh okay.

PATIENT X334
Under my left.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
The one on my back of my neck was basal cell carcinoma.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
This one was like a large tumor due to sun damage.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
But it was not basal cell.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
Uh it's never healed properly and my lip was numb and for eight years the skin peeled off my lips.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
Every other day.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
Uh she wanted me to try this one.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
And I haven't been back because she wanted me to try but this doesn't do anything.

DOCTOR X334
Isn't helping either.

PATIENT X334
No.

DOCTOR X334
When did you last see her?

PATIENT X334
Uh I saw her um maybe three or four months ago.

DOCTOR X334
Okay and that's when she gave you the last cream?

PATIENT X334
She gave me the last one yeah.

DOCTOR X334
And that's not working.

PATIENT X334
She said to see if it would work.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
Uh I still have plenty of it left.  I stopped taking it.

DOCTOR X334
But it's not working.  How long did you try it before you kind of?

PATIENT X334
Uh I used it for uh almost two months.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.  No that's a good try.  So you're supposed to go back and seen them in June, June 11th it looks like.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
Okay, no it's July, July 11th.

PATIENT X334
Right.

DOCTOR X334
Do you want to see if we can get you in earlier?

PATIENT X334
Uh.

DOCTOR X334
Is it really bothering you or are you just kind of.

PATIENT X334
It doesn't really bother me.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
But uh, it's slightly sore.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
And the skin peels off of it every other day.  It's been doing that for eight years.

DOCTOR X334
You can't seem to get it under control huh.  Yeah.  So you're like what's going on yeah.  I'll let them deal with that department since I usually don't do that.

PATIENT X334
Well during the surgery they pulled the skin from the inside of my mouth.

DOCTOR X334
Out.

PATIENT X334
Performed a lift.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
And that skin, it cannot be exposed.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.  Maybe that's why yeah.

PATIENT X334
It has something to do with it.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah, definitely.  It's not made to be outside the mouth so.

PATIENT X334
Right.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.  Well it looks great; it looks really good though you know as you said it was a pretty big mass.

PATIENT X334
Uh it was very large under my lip.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah, alright.

PATIENT X334
And they did two surgeries.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
And at the first surgery.

DOCTOR X334
Where was that done?

PATIENT X334
Uh it was done by a plastic surgeon.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
Uh.

DOCTOR X334
Well I wonder why it's not in here.

PATIENT X334
No that's um, uh xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.  Uh and then your ears, how's that going?  You're following with Audiology.

PATIENT X334
Uh yes the hearing aids are working very well.

DOCTOR X334
Perfect, perfect.

PATIENT X334
I have a device for the telephone also so I'm now able to hear on the phone calls.

DOCTOR X334
Oh good, that's good.  Alright.  Okay I was just putting in your Urology referral.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
For you to go here.  Okay.  Anything else going on?

PATIENT X334
Uh not that I can think of.

DOCTOR X334
How's your weight been doing?  Are you up, down?

PATIENT X334
I'm probably gaining a little weight.

DOCTOR X334
Okay.

PATIENT X334
Uh after I left the hospital I lost 10 pounds.

DOCTOR X334
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X334
But now I've gained it all back again.

DOCTOR X334
You gained it all back huh.  Yeah it looks like you were.

PATIENT X334
I went down to 180.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah, about this time last year you were about the same.

PATIENT X334
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X334
Around like 190.

PATIENT X334

DOCTOR X334
Yeah.

PATIENT X334
Uh that's really too heavy for.

DOCTOR X334
No they have um, they have different programs here you know for like exercise and new programs where they kind of teach you different exercise things to do and also like diet.

PATIENT X334
Hmm.

DOCTOR X334
If you're interested I mean its more trips to the VA if you can and if not I mean.

PATIENT X334
No because I can really do everything on my own.

DOCTOR X334
Okay, that's fine.

PATIENT X334
I kind of follow the best possible diet, low fat, high fiber.

DOCTOR X334
Yeah good for you.

PATIENT X334

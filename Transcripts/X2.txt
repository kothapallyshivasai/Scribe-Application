DOCTOR X2
Let's see.  @@@ to me, oh Lord, @@@.


PATIENT X2
I know it is, you know I knew @@@ my eyes is nothing, my nerves @@@.


DOCTOR X2
Yeah it's because you're not taking your water pills.  You're full of fluid.


PATIENT X2
Okay.


DOCTOR X2
For you your fluid dependent okay.


PATIENT X2
Oh.


DOCTOR X2
The more fluid you have on you, the higher your blood pressure is.


PATIENT X2

DOCTOR X2
Okay, you need to be on the water pill.


PATIENT X2
Well but where the fluid, I urinate the fluid out?


DOCTOR X2

Yeah okay.


DOCTOR X2
You gotta watch what you eat right?


PATIENT X2
Right.


DOCTOR X2
What you drinking.


PATIENT X2
Okay.


DOCTOR X2
If you're drinking too much, you've taken in too much salt, you're gonna retain all that fluid.


PATIENT X2
Okay.


DOCTOR X2
You have a tendency because your liver doesn't, isn't 100% you know.


PATIENT X2
Uh-huh.


DOCTOR X2
So you retain fluids, you have low protein probably, low albumin as they call it, low protein.  So you keep all that fluid in you.


PATIENT X2
Okay.


DOCTOR X2
So the water pill, you gotta be on it.


PATIENT X2
I know doctor, I keep.


DOCTOR X2
And I know you don't want to take it.


PATIENT X2
I keep saying, @@@.  But I've been so busy trying to like just get through the day, I tend of forget about it, just focus on the now with what I have to get done.  If I have to get a letter out, pay a bill or whatever.  The first of the month I go prepare things, go to the bank get the money, go to Cashay, get the money orders and then get around to pay the people.  Uh, so I'm just so focused doing that, if it's not an emergency I usually have a tendency not to put that high on the priority list.

DOCTOR X2
Let me see, okay here's your liver doctor.  I want to see what your liver doctor says.


PATIENT X2
He said he want to put me back on interferon.


DOCTOR X2

DOCTOR X2
You're not a candidate um.


PATIENT X2

DOCTOR X2
For a transplant because of the depression um.


PATIENT X2
So that you may @@@.


DOCTOR X2
No, no, no, not that um, cause you are not, you're intolerant to the interferon.


PATIENT X2
Right, right.


DOCTOR X2
So only on water pills and some Lactulose, he wanted to check your liver function twice a year.  He wanted to do an ultrasound.  He wants to do the endoscopy.


PATIENT X2
Okay, they did the ultrasound.


DOCTOR X2
Yeah and then he said um, go to us to follow your Coumadin, which we did.


PATIENT X2
Okay.


DOCTOR X2
Um okay and then okay.  @@@.  Alright, let's see from my standpoint, what have I got to do for you.  So any ulcers on your leg, are all those healed up?


PATIENT X2
No, they’re not.  It's just you know they getting in and takes a while doing the whatcha call it, the pressure and every once in a while like a blister get on em, fill the water.


DOCTOR X2
They're supposed to drain, remember the first time I met ya.

DOCTOR X2
Oh, okay.


PATIENT X2
All the time, was just for a while.


DOCTOR X2
Oh volunteering?


PATIENT X2
Well, well.


DOCTOR X2
What type of work are we talking about?

It's just standing.  DOCTOR @@@.


DOCTOR X2
Why don't you just go volunteer?


PATIENT X2
Well cause they're planning to do more voluntaring than I do there and when I get no salary.


DOCTOR X2
No that's weird.  The VA @@@ takes good care of you @@@.

Right, well I get a special compensation cause I got two, I got two 100s really for the stroke and for the PTSD but it's just that I just want to do something with my life.  I'm not doing nothing just sitting and looking at the TV all day.

DOCTOR X2
Do you think uh, do you think volunteering would be more fruitful for you cause, cause volunteerism is a little bit more like you know you're donating your time.


PATIENT X2
I know but, but from what I understand the job description, I'm not, I would probably be doing less than if I volunteered.


DOCTOR X2
And they need a note from me?


PATIENT X2
No, no I was just asking your professional opinion.


DOCTOR X2
Well the thing is if you, you know if you feel that physically you're able to do it, I encourage you, you know, to be more active in your life and happy if you want to do it.


PATIENT X2
Right, well uh.

DOCTOR X2
But, like I don't want you to go and then be limited to be there, you know kind of fall backwards.


PATIENT X2
Well they, first my psychiatrist referred me to the program.


DOCTOR X2
Oh good, okay.


PATIENT X2
And and so.


DOCTOR X2
Yeah.


PATIENT X2
Then he signed off on it.


DOCTOR X2
But again you know, if you're having a hard time taking care of yourself around the house, I, I wonder how um, well you'll do this job, you know what I mean?


PATIENT X2
Yeah, right.


DOCTOR X2
You could try it.


PATIENT X2
Well we'll see, all, all the state could do is actually like, if somebody come out there, they don't do no vital signs or anything.


DOCTOR X2
Okay.


PATIENT X2
Or anything medical, they just want us come there and.


DOCTOR X2
Help you around the house.


PATIENT X2

DOCTOR X2
Why don't you try it out and if you seem to struggle with it, you know, you know yourself.


PATIENT X2

DOCTOR X2
But to be honest with you, I'd rather you concentrate on your medicines.


PATIENT X2
Okay, you're right.


DOCTOR X2

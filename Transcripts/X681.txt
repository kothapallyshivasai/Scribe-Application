PATIENT X681
Something like, usually one before I go to work, probably once or twice, get to work, I have to use it twice, when I get home usually and when I go to bed I have to use it.  The other morning like 3 or 4 I have to go to the bathroom.
 
DOCTOR X681

DOCTOR X681

PATIENT X681
Yeah.  It's watery and uh real hard.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.

PATIENT X681
Like I'm never, I never feel a relief like I can't just go once and I'm done.  It's like more in there.  I expect, they had checked my colon.

DOCTOR X681
Yeah it was all normal.

PATIENT X681
Well I think it's in my intestines.

DOCTOR X681
Well it's the same thing, colon is the intestines.  They look at your entire intestines with a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X681
They got these, so I think I got @@@ that's all or take one of them, something ain't right.

DOCTOR X681
Are you losing any weight or gaining weight?

PATIENT X681
No.  Been the same size.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.  Any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT X681
Well when I use it there is so much that come out at once.

DOCTOR X681
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X681
It's a lot.

DOCTOR X681
I know it's hard, absolutely.  Do you feel anxious at all?  Do you feel like you're stressed out or anything like that or?  No, okay.  Your blood pressure looks good today.  You're taking your two medicines correct.

PATIENT X681
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X681
Perfect and at home it's been looking okay?

PATIENT X681
I really haven't been checking.

DOCTOR X681
That's okay it looks good today, that's fine and are you taking the psyllium powder?

PATIENT X681
Yeah, not that often but I take it.

DOCTOR X681
Try to take it as often as you can, daily or something like that.  I don't know if it'll help but.

PATIENT X681
No it ain't no help.

DOCTOR X681
Try that.

PATIENT X681
I had surgery on my groin.

DOCTOR X681
Yeah, you have a.

PATIENT X681
Yeah I have another one, it's like not in the groin area.  It's like up under my scrotum.

DOCTOR X681
Oh yeah, when did you first notice that?

PATIENT X681
About a month ago.

DOCTOR X681
Okay and has it gotten bigger?

PATIENT X681
It was, it went down now but.

DOCTOR X681
It's okay.

PATIENT X681
It keeps coming and going though.  

DOCTOR X681
Um do you want to go see surgery again?  Do you want to get it drained or just going down, what do you want to do?

PATIENT X681
Uh I could get it looked at, see if they could drain.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.  What did they do for it or does it just go down?  Did you do anything?

PATIENT X681
Keeping it clean.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.  Any blood when you urinate?  @@@?

PATIENT X681
No.  It gets really hard, like a knot.

DOCTOR X681
Yeah and does it every have any pus come out of it or anything like that?

PATIENT X681
No.  Well I mean, do you know where that come from?  Why I keep getting them?

DOCTOR X681
Well some people just have a certain bacteria and they are prone to get what's called furuncle they're little abscesses and they tend to be in areas that are more moist, so the groin area.

PATIENT X681
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X681
@@@ sometimes in the armpits and they tend to do that.  So you know keeping it clean and that'll go a long way and help out and know some people will get it because they have what's called @@@ a certain bacteria in their body; the blood flows together who knows and then for some reason some people are more prone to develop these little abscesses, they just have to keep getting drained.

PATIENT X681
Okay.

DOCTOR X681
It's annoying.  When was the last time that you saw the surgeons?

PATIENT X681
Um it's been a while.

DOCTOR X681
It's been a while.

PATIENT X681
@@@.

DOCTOR X681
Well when was the last time you got it drained?

PATIENT X681
Hmm February.

DOCTOR X681
February.

PATIENT X681
February, March.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT X681
No.

DOCTOR X681
Okay very good.  I'm gonna take a listen to you.  @@@.  Did you get your flu shot this year?

PATIENT X681
Uh yeah I got it at my job.

DOCTOR X681
Okay good.  Do you need any refills on your blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT X681
Uh yeah you can.

DOCTOR X681
Okay. Want to get it mailed to you?

PATIENT X681

DOCTOR X681
Take some deep breaths.  One more good.  Breathe normally.  No belly pain or anything like that?

PATIENT X681
Just be feeling light.

DOCTOR X681
Does it feel full, like fluid or?

PATIENT X681
I just feel like almost it's uh @@@.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.

PATIENT X681
I'm not sure I be feeling like that but then it puffed out again.

DOCTOR X681
Do you feel fuller, is it painful?

PATIENT X681
No I ain't full.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.

PATIENT X681
It's still, like maybe it's like my stomach gets to growling @@@.

DOCTOR X681
Uh-huh.  Any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X681
No.  That's a little, like @@@.

DOCTOR X681
Just a little @@@.

PATIENT X681
Yeah I think.  

DOCTOR X681
Let me go check a couple of things and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT X681
You want to take a look at the uh?

DOCTOR X681
Yeah I @@@ take a look at it.  Go ahead and have a seat okay.  Has it gotten bigger or anything?

PATIENT X681
It was hard, sort of like the skin was hard as it was, it was right here.

DOCTOR X681
Right there?

PATIENT X681
Yeah.

DOCTOR X681
Okay.  You don't have any other ones that you're aware of?

PATIENT X681
Well I usually get them like in here.

DOCTOR X681
Up in the groin.  Yeah right in here, right.

PATIENT X681
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X681
You don't have anything there.

PATIENT X681
Just this thing here.

DOCTOR X681
Is there a reason @@@ or anything like that.

PATIENT X681
I got a little muscle @@@.

DOCTOR X681
Let me see.  Have you always had that?

PATIENT X681
Yeah.

DOCTOR X681
Is that, that's not new.

PATIENT X681
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X681
Yeah if means going down to Surgery to go look at it or um just wait for it to go down, whatever you want.  Uh that area is a little bit harder to drain if it's that small.

PATIENT X681
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X681
You know what I mean.

PATIENT X681
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X681
It's a little bit harder if it's that small but um it's something that's pretty effective, no problem.  Or we can wait and see if it goes down @@@ about it.  

PATIENT X681
Okay.

DOCTOR X681
What do you want to do?  But yeah so @@@ it seems pretty superficial.

PATIENT X681
Okay.

DOCTOR X681
They just have to be careful when they drain it.

PATIENT X681
Yeah.

DOCTOR X681
And if it's going down, maybe not mess with it right now.  It's a pretty invasive procedure and that's a pretty @@@ area.  I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:44  DOCTOR IN:  27:20)

DOCTOR X681
Alright sir.  So in terms of causes of diarrhea I'm not quite sure what else you can do from the General Medicine Clinic other than maybe increase the fiber, things that @@@ before so I need you to go back to the GI doctors too so um.  I think you need to go back to the Surgery Clinic and maybe have them take a look at it and see if it does get bigger, to have it at least looked at you know and they can compare it and then uh for your blood pressure, let's see.  One of the numbers is a little bit high today and I was wondering if we should go up on one of your medicines.  Yeah, cause even the lower number has been a little bit on the higher side and so the metoprolol you take 25 mg twice a day?

PATIENT X681
Yeah half pills.

DOCTOR X681
Yeah why don't go to a whole pill?

PATIENT X681
Okay.

DOCTOR X681
Okay and then if it makes you dizzy then drop back to a half a pill and then come back in.

PATIENT X681
Okay.

DOCTOR X681
Okay I need to put it into the system for you and you have two refills of the hydrochlorothiazide so I'll go ahead and refill it as well.  And then, other than that I think that's everything.  You got your flu shot and everything.

PATIENT X681
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X681
So I'll have you go back up there and make an appointment with the General Surgery Clinic, the door to where you check in.

PATIENT X681
Alright.

DOCTOR X681
And then you'll go there.  The next time I see you um, which will probably be in three or four months or so, go ahead and go to the Lab before you come in and get a cholesterol panel done.

PATIENT X681
Cholesterol panel?

DOCTOR X681
Yeah it's a cholesterol level, you just do it once a year.  You had it in November of last year and did you eat lunch or breakfast today?

PATIENT X681
No.

DOCTOR X681
Well we can do then today if you want; if you don't want to we'll have you do it when you come back, whichever one you would prefer.

PATIENT X681
Uh I'll get it cause I'm here.

DOCTOR X681
Okay, I'll put in to do that do that today.  

PATIENT X681
Okay. 

DOCTOR X681
@@@.

PATIENT X681
So where do I go to get those done?

DOCTOR X681
Right across the hall here.  Right across the hall, go to the Lab.

PATIENT X681
Oh the Lab okay.

DOCTOR X681
@@@ you have a nice day.

PATIENT X681
Alright thanks.

PATIENT LEAVES:  29:48.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

So they'll just do another evaluation.

PATIENT X601
Okay.

DOCTOR X601

SECOND PERSON X601
Yeah.  They think he may have like sundowners.

DOCTOR X601
Oh right.

SECOND PERSON X601
@@@ cause he doesn't remember too much from that.

DOCTOR X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601
Um and they were thinking about possibly getting more Home Health Care things.

DOCTOR X601
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
For him at home.

DOCTOR X601
What's the situation at home now?

SECOND PERSON X601
He has xxx, his lady friend who lives with him and she is absolute helpful.

DOCTOR X601
Really.

SECOND PERSON X601
He remembers taking medicine and all that but she is partially in a wheelchair.  She can stand but it's mostly to get around in the wheelchair.

DOCTOR X601
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
So we do have a nurse come in through the VA.

DOCTOR X601
Sure.  Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh one or two times a week to make sure he has medicines um you know just set that up daily to make sure he takes his inhalers and that type of thing and they have experienced the day where he's had a bad day.

DOCTOR X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601
And had uh notified me that you know that he's sometimes progressing in the wrong direction.

DOCTOR X601
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X601
Progressing.  So the um, they note and definitely notate in their documentation what they see.

DOCTOR X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601
So the doctors can understand what's going on, you know, daily basis.

DOCTOR X601
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X601
And they could absolutely and they have spoken with DOCTOR so she knows um what they assume.

DOCTOR X601
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X601
For him as well cause they may know how to tell it in a different, you know medical terminology than I may.

DOCTOR X601
Right.

SECOND PERSON X601
You know.

DOCTOR X601
Okay.  Um let's see @@@.  

SECOND PERSON X601
He has some days unfortunately when he has good days and sometimes he has days where he'll be like deer in the headlights.

DOCTOR X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601
So @@@ or anything.

DOCTOR X601
Okay.  Okay and let me check his medications here real quick.  

SECOND PERSON X601
Oh and I think he's out of the um, everything's now @@@ but the um depression pill.

DOCTOR X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601
I think that needs a refill and possibly the galantamine.

DOCTOR X601
Okay and does he get all those in the mail?

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X601
Okay yeah, the galantamine is um.

SECOND PERSON X601
But I just think, yeah one of those, citalopram.

DOCTOR X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601
That one.

DOCTOR X601
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
@@@.

DOCTOR X601
Okay, uh we can do that.  So I'll ask DOCTOR what else is available other than you have a nurse already coming by um.

SECOND PERSON X601

DOCTOR X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X601

PATIENT X601
Huh?  What?

SECOND PERSON X601
Do you think it's sometimes hard to get here dad?  Is it hard to get to the VA and come in and out of the car?  Would you like to see a doctor visit you at home?

SECOND PERSON X601

SECOND PERSON X601
The urinalysis?  He hasn't done that yet.

DOCTOR X601
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
He couldn't go.

DOCTOR X601
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
Maybe now.

DOCTOR X601
Everything else looks good though.

SECOND PERSON X601
Good.

DOCTOR X601
The brains uh from the head.  Did he get an MRI for that or?

SECOND PERSON X601
He @@@.

DOCTOR X601
That's great right.

SECOND PERSON X601
@@@.

DOCTOR X601
There we are, yep there are no changes and I guess I actually looked at this earlier today um.  So you noticed some changes 
from the @@@ um in the past.

SECOND PERSON X601
Pardon me?

DOCTOR X601
There are changes that are old in the past, so maybe some old @@@ or an old stroke but it's not recent.

SECOND PERSON X601
Recent okay.

DOCTOR X601
So that's good.

SECOND PERSON X601
Yeah it is good.

DOCTOR X601
Yeah.  Um okay we'll figure it out and I'll be right back.

SECOND PERSON X601
What were the blood tests?

DOCTOR X601
So we had, right we did a number of tests for the cholesterol which looks like it's controlled.  We did the blood count for like the hemoglobin and anemia so we take a quick look at and then we checked his kidney function which was okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X601
And then we checked the TSH which is thyroid and the B12 um which can sometimes be abnormal and can affect people on memory loss, that is still pending.  Uh the TSH was normal though.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

DOCTOR X601
That's another thing that we wanted to do.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

DOCTOR X601
Um so um so we will have, um what we talked about is having you go to the PAC.

SECOND PERSON X601
Right.

DOCTOR X601
And um it's near the Emergency Room.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

DOCTOR X601
And there's a physician there that you can talk to, it's a walk-in clinic.

SECOND PERSON X601
Oh.

DOCTOR X601
So um we can call there before you go or something but um.

SECOND PERSON X601
@@@.

DOCTOR X601
We'll get.

SECOND PERSON X601
Yeah.

DOCTOR X601
Yeah okay.  I will be right back.

SECOND PERSON X601
Is the iron low?  Cause he is on iron but its.

DOCTOR X601
Um his hemoglobin's okay.  We didn't check the iron.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay that's fine yeah.

DOCTOR X601
I'll be right back.

SECOND PERSON X601
Oh okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  85:50  DOCTOR IN:  98:40)

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Alright PATIENT how are you?

PATIENT X601
I'm doing good, how about you?

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Alright um so, you look like you're feeling good.  Your sleep is good.  Do you sleep good?

PATIENT X601
Oh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
@@@ nap.

PATIENT X601
Yeah like a baby.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Not all day though?  Not all day, you don't sleep like a baby.

PATIENT X601
No, no, no.  @@@.

Doctors speak with one another about treatment.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
His blood pressure is a little bit on the low side but does it run low at home?

SECOND PERSON X601
Oh no.  Yeah and he doesn't drink enough water and I just wanted to make sure.  Is he on any medicines, his blood pressure's alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
One question @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X601
Yeah he's been having it.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Okay so here is the plan.  So we'll get some potassium since the level is just a little bit @@@ okay.  Oh and then go to the PAC Clinic, DOCTOR already know about him um so I want him to be evaluated to see if any medications would cause him you know getting this.  I think the fact where we need to prevent not able to sleep at night.

SECOND PERSON X601
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
So I think that's kind of it today and the next visit.

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh-huh.  So then he doesn't rest then obviously he's a lot more confused, a lot more paranoid and that makes things worse.

SECOND PERSON X601
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
So we'll see what they will tell us.

PATIENT X601
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Cause it's still psychiatry's stuff so.  And then as far as home-based health care, they will contact you.  I gave your number to her.

SECOND PERSON X601
No you didn't give me a number.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
No I gave your number to her and they will contact you.

SECOND PERSON X601
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Because they need the family doctor's approval.  So you get the visiting nurse but the visiting nurse has to stop and let these people take over because the nurse also comes from the VA.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay, so what do you think about the Home Health Care?

SECOND DOCTOR X601
I think it is, because he can't come to so many appointments and his situation may need more of home therapy based rather than consult based.

SECOND PERSON X601
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
So I think that is uh, that is a good thing.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
In fact I would um, I would recommend that.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Um not that I don't like PATIENT because it's that a lot more easier.

SECOND PERSON X601
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
For him to get more care.  Especially the physical therapy and other things also.

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Okay, alright and then um let us see, they may have contact they don't have opening available in that area so we don't even know anymore ourselves but at least give it a try.

SECOND PERSON X601
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Um and then the, you have a homemaker?

SECOND PERSON X601
Um.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Actually, do you want a homemaker?

SECOND PERSON X601
What do they do, cleaning?

PATIENT X601
No, no, no, no, no.

SECOND PERSON X601
Dad.

PATIENT X601
The issue with my house.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
So that is the only other help that @@@ that's helping him.

SECOND PERSON X601
The um, cause NAME has someone come in.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Oh okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
To do the like a little bit of cleaning.  No cooking though.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
No they don't cook, it's just cleaning.

SECOND PERSON X601
Do they clean?

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X601
Then right now no.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Okay.  Alright.  So we'll just wait for the @@@ to do that.

SECOND PERSON X601
And then if we change our mind we could, cause we won't be seeing you then.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Um they say @@@ will be the primary physician.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Um the, so but uh I think given the whole benefit of the program.

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
That may be good for him though.

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X601
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
So because.

SECOND PERSON X601
DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Yeah they are usually pretty good.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
They talk with physical therapy, the nurses are called I mean you have a lot more active through the nurses if they did, if he gets sick they are more @@@.

SECOND PERSON X601
So @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Yeah that's what they are paid, if he gets sick the nurse will rush right @@@.  That's part of the same as what I would do but on the other hand getting like him not coming for more appointments and especially with physical therapy and stuff like that uh that would be more convenient at home.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay and you would indicate that they'll @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
It's already made.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
They will find out whether or not there are any available in your area.

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.  Thank you doctor.

SECOND DOCTOR X601
Okay.  So before you go home.

SECOND PERSON X601

SECOND PERSON X601
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X601
Watch it when it's set up and he can go to the clinic.  Okay, let me put in the consult, so this is where you go in, once I put this order in.

SECOND PERSON X601

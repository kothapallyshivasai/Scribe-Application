PATIENT X506
This was a different case than what I had before.  Before the room @@@.

DOCTOR X506
Right.

PATIENT X506
I can pick it up.

DOCTOR X506

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
I'll put in 11 refills.

PATIENT X506
Okay.

DOCTOR X506
Okay.

PATIENT X506
I'll pick it up and @@@ let me know I got an appointment for the, did you see that in there uh, @@@ what is it?

DOCTOR X506
Yeah dry eye.

PATIENT X506
Yeah.

DOCTOR X506
They have @@@ once a day.  You're supposed to take it twice a day.

PATIENT X506
No I only take it once.

DOCTOR X506
You only take it once that helps you?

PATIENT X506
It helps a little bit but it don't, it look like at the end of the day, cause I take it in the morning.

DOCTOR X506
Right.

PATIENT X506
Cause I do it in the daytime so @@@.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah this is supposed to be twice a day so I'm gonna put it for twice a day.

PATIENT X506
Twice a day okay.

DOCTOR X506
Alright.  That's the only difference.

PATIENT X506
And I might you know.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah.

PATIENT X506
@@@ yeah if I don't need it twice.

DOCTOR X506
It only works if you take it all the time though.  Like even, like if you don't take it for a couple days then uh the acid-blocking like what it does.

PATIENT X506
Cut back.

DOCTOR X506
You have to start all over again.

PATIENT X506
Uh no, no, let me take it every day.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah and you're supposed to take it twice a day, try and take it every day.

PATIENT X506
Twice a day okay.

DOCTOR X506
Because it helps the most when you're lying in bed um.

PATIENT X506
Right.

DOCTOR X506
@@@ most of the time @@@ the acid is going up your esophagus, cause you're lying down.

PATIENT X506
Yeah so the acid is running back up.

DOCTOR X506
Right so that's the main thing but um yeah.  Well I'm glad they're giving you something, the vertigo, everybody pretty much gets it and all it is is that the inner ear.

PATIENT X506
Right.

DOCTOR X506
Did they explain it to you like what's going on?

PATIENT X506
No I thought it was coming from an infection.

DOCTOR X506
Oh not.

PATIENT X506
Not necessarily.

DOCTOR X506
Not necessarily.

PATIENT X506
Necessarily yeah.

DOCTOR X506
Some people get it from an infection but most people get it just when there are these little fillings in both of our ears.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
They tell our brains where we are like so right now you know you're sitting up.

PATIENT X506
Right.

DOCTOR X506
You know you're not laying down.  You know that because there are these @@@ in the ear that stay down.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
Most of the time, sometimes when you're laying down.

PATIENT X506
Right.

DOCTOR X506
And so we know that @@@ up but sometimes what happens, for no reasons, the @@@ kind of can get out of whack.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
Like one of them will go up here or go down here somewhere.

PATIENT X506
Oh.

DOCTOR X506
And so then your brain gets confused and it's like well what's going on am I standing up, am I sitting down and just right or left.

PATIENT X506
Yeah.

DOCTOR X506
So you're kind of going in circles.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
But usually this medicine kind of helps the brain to ignore the ears.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
And so it tells it you know the ears messed up.

PATIENT X506
@@@ the other one is I got the vertigo.

DOCTOR X506
Oh the vertigo right, right, yeah definitely right.

PATIENT X506
Yeah.

DOCTOR X506
Uh so that's how that medicine helps and usually in time those @@@ just kind of get back in their place.

PATIENT X506
Okay.

DOCTOR X506
And then @@@.

PATIENT X506
Like @@@.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah.

PATIENT X506
You know you want to get out of the wax @@@.

DOCTOR X506
Exactly.  There are some exercises you can do to kind of help speed it along.

PATIENT X506
Okay.

DOCTOR X506
Did they teach you those?

PATIENT X506
No.

DOCTOR X506
No.  Let me show you, so basically what you do is @@@ first.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
Um but then after the @@@ like so basically what you're doing is just kind of shaking everything up.

PATIENT X506
Yeah trying to get it.

DOCTOR X506
In the right place you know. 

PATIENT X506
Yeah.

DOCTOR X506
So this is what you do, and then in the morning when you wake up you just kind of go like this and then you get fluid in @@@ and you want to wait like 10 seconds.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
And you go like this, I know it seems kind of silly but what you're doing is.

PATIENT X506
That's what I've been doing really is like that.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah and you just kind of do it three or four times and try to be a little bit slower than I'm doing.

PATIENT X506
Yeah.

DOCTOR X506
And you just go like that, do that like in the morning and at bedtime

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
And do this, probably like 10 minutes of that.

PATIENT X506
Yeah.

DOCTOR X506
And that should help.

PATIENT X506
Keep them down to size.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X506
Staying in place.

DOCTOR X506
Right exactly.  So.

PATIENT X506
I didn't know, I thought maybe it was infection or something like that.

DOCTOR X506
Sometimes that can cause it too but this will mostly.

PATIENT X506
He said I don't have an infection.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah you can tell that just by looking in the ear if he looked in your ear.

PATIENT X506
He looked in it yeah.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah so he could tell so @@@.

PATIENT X506
But other than that I'm doing alright.  Just that acid reflux you know.

DOCTOR X506
@@@.

PATIENT X506
Right.

DOCTOR X506
Every day @@@ problems @@@.

PATIENT X506
@@@.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah we can adjust it @@@.

PATIENT X506
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X506
We'll @@@.

PATIENT X506
They did an x-ray on me in the Emergency Room @@@.

DOCTOR X506
A chest x-ray?  Yeah I see it was normal.

PATIENT X506

DOCTOR X506

PATIENT X506
Okay.

DOCTOR X506

PATIENT X506
Yeah.  The water pills and the.

DOCTOR X506
@@@.  Yeah we'll @@@.  So you taking the Tylenol?

PATIENT X506

DOCTOR X506

PATIENT X506

DOCTOR X506

PATIENT X506
That's for the stomach is that what it is?

DOCTOR X506

PATIENT X506

DOCTOR X506
They never came.  I'll put them in.

PATIENT X506
Actually when I went over there to uh get them.

DOCTOR X506

PATIENT X506

DOCTOR X506
Oh uh I'll refill them for you.

PATIENT X506
Okay.  Now they gave me a inhaler.

DOCTOR X506
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X506
In the Emergency Room what do you think about that?

DOCTOR X506
For the oh because at that time you were having a cough.

PATIENT X506
Cause I had that real bad cough, @@@ that's another thing I had trouble with.  See when I got the cough, That's when I coughed that foam up.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah.

PATIENT X506
Because I was coughing I couldn't stop, it was like the whooping cough.

DOCTOR X506
Yeah, that's probably what it, yeah.

PATIENT X506
And after I got rid of that then the acid reflux was a combination with the cough.

DOCTOR X506
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X506
And that's why they gave me the this here and then @@@ that's when @@@.

DOCTOR X413
Um let's see, what else.  Last time you came in you were having some left ankle pain, shooting pain in both your toes and hands, especially on the right side, still have it?

PATIENT X413

DOCTOR X413
Gabapentin?

PATIENT X413
That's it.

DOCTOR X413
Okay.

PATIENT X413
But do you have anything stronger?

DOCTOR X413
Well what dose are you on?  We can increase it.

PATIENT X413
Well I did because uh its 300 mg I think and I'm taking two each time.

DOCTOR X413
We can increase it even more than that.  That's what you're supposed to do, you're supposed to increase it until it starts helping.

PATIENT X413
Okay.

DOCTOR X413
Cause the pain you have is called, it seems like the way you describe it, the kind of the way you're describing like shooting pain.

PATIENT X413
Yes.

DOCTOR X413
It sounds like what we call neuropathic pain.

PATIENT X413
Right.

DOCTOR X413
And that can happen in people with diabetes and can be perfectly controlled.

PATIENT X413
So you're saying it's all my fault?

DOCTOR X413
Nothing is your fault.  I'm just saying why it happens.  You can interpret that however you like.

PATIENT X413
Did I show you what happened to my toes?

DOCTOR X413
Nope.

PATIENT X413
Now Podiatry, Podiatry actually was doing their thing and I told them, I said my toes have been bothering me so I had a guy that told me he said no, but when he cut my toenails he did it like that everywhere but since then, the toenail has come off.  

DOCTOR X413
How long ago was this?

PATIENT X413

But you know what, this toe doesn't, okay.  Look here, I can bend that.

DOCTOR X413
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X413
Ever since the surgery I'm not getting the range in it.

DOCTOR X413

PATIENT X413

PATIENT X413
Wait a minute.  These are new glasses here. I'm not going to get me a new prescription unless they gonna pay for them.

DOCTOR X413
You're not really a prescription for now on because people with diabetes have risks for eye problems so we just like you to see the eye doctor once a year okay.

PATIENT X413
Yeah.

DOCTOR X413
So we need to schedule an appointment for the eye doctor.

PATIENT X413
Put it in there.

DOCTOR X413

PATIENT X413

DOCTOR X413

PATIENT X413
You know what, I cancelled that appointment I think that was the day we buried my grandfather and I had to cancel that appointment and I didn't make a new one.

DOCTOR X413
Okay.  They can do that for you up front too.  And I think you're gonna end up having to see the diabetic, the Pharmacy because of your diabetes your hemoglobin is too high and uh.

PATIENT X413
Uh DOCTOR.

Uh-huh.

PATIENT X413
That's like.

DOCTOR X413

DOCTOR X413
Yeah.

PATIENT X413
Yes.

DOCTOR X413
Well you're gonna have to see her about uh.

PATIENT X413
Why?

DOCTOR X413
Because we need to get your diabetes under control so I'm probably gonna have you, we might change your meds around a little bit because are you taking your meds religiously?

PATIENT X413
Yeah.

DOCTOR X413
Every day?

PATIENT X413
85 in the morning, 65 in the evening and every now and then.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Hi.

PATIENT X413
Hey DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Where is your sugar log?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Told you she'd ask you.

PATIENT X413
You were supposed to tell her that, well you can.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Oh I was supposed to lie to her?  (Laughter)

PATIENT X413
No, no, not lie but just tell her so she wouldn't come, cause she jumps, she hits me.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
So really PATIENT we went over this last time and so you did not bring the log, you are taking your insulin but you don't check so how am I going to adjust those readings uh, sugar readings the insulin reading.  Okay so we'll have a pharmacist see you.  Now you are coming two times, next after January 1st, one is the Liver Clinic; one is the Eye Clinic so one of those days you can have the nurse to see you.

PATIENT X413
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Make it on the 4th, I think I will be back by then so we can check your sugars and adjust your insulin then.

PATIENT X413
So you want me to draw the blood today or what?

SECOND DOCTOR X413
No you don't need any blood tests.  I'm talking about you checking your sugars at home the same time each day and do you have those sheets or you want me to give you new ones?

PATIENT X413
I have those @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Okay so that we can have at least three or four readings of each column.

PATIENT X413
So you want me to do it three times a day?

SECOND DOCTOR X413
No one time a day but different times each day.

PATIENT X413
Oh okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
So uh see your glycosylated is 8.5 which is bad.  Then you have problems with your feet and so forth and your neuropathy is never going to get better your diabetes is still a factor.

PATIENT X413
But you know what DOCTOR some days they'll feel fine and then I think when the weather changes, later like at night and it feels like.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
No that's the neuropathy and it's from your diabetes.  As long as your diabetes continues to be doing poorly it will only get worse.  Okay but if you get it controlled it may actually get better but if we don't do anything, no matter how many medicines I give you it's not going to be better.  It's @@@.  If your diabetes is not controlled it is going to get worse.

PATIENT X413
And I'm trying to lose the weight cause.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Well that's good.  You do diet, you do exercise, you do your insulin, those are all the things that will control it.  Just not increasing the weight will help you in terms of your insulin.  So you really need to do all of the things similarly but at the same time you need to check your sugar so that it @@@ you where you are and if it goes up then we can adjust your medications.

PATIENT X413
I know that.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
But in terms of Vicodin that's the other pain medication so that would not be the medication for your diabetic neuropathy.
 
PATIENT X413
No but it helps.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
What I can do is, DOCTOR was mentioning to you that we can increase the gabapentin to 900 three times a day since you've been increasing it already.

PATIENT X413
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
And that would be good.

PATIENT X413
Do I take it in the morning?

SECOND DOCTOR X413
So it's a neuropathy medication.

PATIENT X413
Yeah that would be good.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Okay so we'll increase that.  I can give you like 16 pill refill with no refills and this is not for the neuropathy pain.

PATIENT X413
No, no.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
It's Vicodin if you need it but no refills.  I don't want to get in the habit of taking Vicodin for regular pain.

PATIENT X413
And like I told her, I still have a few pills from the last time you gave me some.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Yeah.  Then what I'm saying for, the medicine that is not for this and I don't want you to, I will issue the pain medication okay.

PATIENT X413
Alright.  So now you supposed to be going over to @@@ this year.

SECOND DOCTOR X413
Next week.

PATIENT X413
Where you going?

SECOND DOCTOR X413
@@@.

PATIENT X413
That's where you're at?

SECOND DOCTOR X413

SECOND DOCTOR X413

PATIENT X413

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Alright @@@.  I have been trying.  I have all these records I've got to go through.

PATIENT X413

FIRST DOCTOR X413
She asked me what your blood sugar was and I said you didn't bring it.  @@@.

PATIENT X413
Now you probably said he didn't bring it, you been had, I know you telling me.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
You know I do what I can to set you up, that's my bad.  Alright so here's what we're gonna do.

PATIENT X413
She didn't say, where, where you log at.  She always gets me.  She's been doing that since 2000, you know that.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
I know.

PATIENT X413
She's been my, I love DOCTOR.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
She is pretty awesome.  

PATIENT X413
Well I swear by her.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
She is pretty awesome.

PATIENT X413
Every time I, I can call her from home, she says okay you come in to the clinic, I'll be waiting here and I go pop and I get here and she say @@@ and she treats you like a little kid just drag me down the hall and she have me in the Emergency Room and I'm admitted to the hospital.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
I know because she cares about you.

PATIENT X413
Yes she does.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Alright so here's what we're gonna do.  You already have some appointments coming up. You've got on January 12th you've got your liver appointment.

PATIENT X413
I thought that was on the 4th she said.  She just said.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
The 4th is with Podiatry.

PATIENT X413
Podiatry and what else?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
The 4th you've got Podiatry and I want you to have them schedule you for a Diabetic Pharmacy on January 4th as well.

PATIENT X413
Yeah to see DOCTOR.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Uh-huh.  So ask them to do that up front and bring your labs or your logs.  Um we need to reschedule your orthopedic appointment because you missed it on December 4th.

PATIENT X413
But you know what I knew there was something that I needed to do, I knew it.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
No that's okay.

PATIENT X413
But I thought I scheduled it for today because I knew I was going to be here early.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Right.  Well they can make it for you.

PATIENT X413
And they're there on Mondays and Fridays only.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Right.

PATIENT X413
So I knew it.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
You can have them reschedule that for you up front.  So we'll reschedule your Ortho appointment.

PATIENT X413
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
We'll schedule your eye doctor.

PATIENT X413
I need to reschedule with Ortho.  

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Ophthalmology for the eye doctor, Orthopedics um Diabetes with the Pharmacy and now for your uh pain in your eye they're increasing your gabapentin to 800 mg three times a day.

PATIENT X413
I thought she said 900?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
You know you already have them and I mean you can do that way this time.  Um well I'll give you the 900 three times a day.  Um then the other thing is we want to get some these; basically it's called arterial blood study in your lower extremities of your legs.  Um because we're worried about some of this might arterial as well as the pain you're describing.

PATIENT X413
Arterial means?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
So your arteries are the blood vessels that take blood into the body.

PATIENT X413
That's what I'm wondering you know because right after the surgery.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X413
It was you know, just before I blacked out in surgery I remember seeing my feet @@@ and the way they tied the toes to hang that foot up there for them to do.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X413
I'm like.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Well what we'll do is we'll have them do that for you so that we can make sure that your arteries are doing okay.

PATIENT X413
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Okay.

PATIENT X413
Okay.  Cause I'm running here, I mean like here.  Okay the whole foot used to look like that.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
No, no.  Only some of the @@@ you know was due to the injury that you had and what not so let's.

PATIENT X413
And actually do a lotion, a lotion to put the sock on and it takes it right off.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X413
And we just.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Well let's get this done.

PATIENT X413
That'll be fine.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Then we'll have an explanation okay.  And I'll see you back in three months, how does that sound?

PATIENT X413
No I want to see DOCTOR.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Ha, ha, ha.

PATIENT X413
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
You can try to schedule with her if you want.

PATIENT X413
@@@ in three months I'll forget something you know.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Really.

PATIENT X413
And I figure if I.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
No really if you want to come and see her, you can always take a look at them.

PATIENT X413
What about, why can't we go every month and a half instead of three months?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
I mean I don't think you need to see me every month and a half.

PATIENT X413
Why?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Because you don't have that many medical problems for you to.

PATIENT X413
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
If you want to see me every month and half.

PATIENT X413
You know what, yes I do because I want to get, I want to get cut down on insulin.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
So that's not gonna happen by you seeing me more often though.

PATIENT X413
Yes it will because I'll be bringing in my readings and you'll be telling me about those others.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Yeah but you see the thing is your labs right now that you've been getting like your A1c which shows up your um your blood sugar over what the average over a three month period is high.

PATIENT X413
Well what should that be?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
It should be less than 7.

PATIENT X413
8.5, that's nothing.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
High.

PATIENT X413
It used to be 13 or higher.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
I know its better.

PATIENT X413
So come on, you just you want jack with me (laughter).

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Well it used to be but that doesn't mean you know we need to keep working at it.  The only way you're gonna come off of your medications is to lose more weight.

PATIENT X413
Now what medication am I taking for the diabetes?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
@@@.  And so the only way this is gonna work is, the only way you can get your blood sugar where it's at goal is by using a log and the only way you can end up with having less medications is to lose more weight.

PATIENT X413
I'm trying to do that but now but the reason I was saying if I come in every month and a half then I could draw some blood and I'll feel better knowing that after which I'll know where I'm at.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Well we can't check this laboratory more than every three months anyway.  It probably doesn't make sense to check it cause they give you an average of your blood sugars for three months, for a three month period so we wouldn't check it more than every three months.  Does that make sense?  You can come and see me more often if you want I just don't think it's going to change our management of you.

PATIENT X413
I think it will.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Okay if you want to you're more than welcome to call and schedule if something has happened.

PATIENT X413
It's like I'm being monitored you know.  I feel more comfortable.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
If you feel more comfortable then absolutely you can come more often as you like.

PATIENT X413
I feel comfortable knowing that I'm being monitored properly and that yes I am doing the right thing.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Good.

PATIENT X413
And I'm 51; I want to see 61, 71, 81.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X413
91, I want to keep going.  I want to keep you know feeling like I'm feeling right now.  You know I want to have motivation some day.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X413
And it's not because of my diabetes; I don't know what it is.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Yeah.

PATIENT X413
Like yesterday I felt like.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Have you thought about @@@?

PATIENT X413
@@@ only because, I don't think it's that bad.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
@@@.

PATIENT X413
I don't think done now.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Sometimes @@@.  You can see them @@@.

PATIENT X413

FIRST DOCTOR X413
I mean they're doctors too you know.

PATIENT X413
I know.  That guy that just killed those people at xxx xxx, what was he, a psychiatrist.  @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
He was a psychologist.

PATIENT X413
Psych, Psych something.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Psychologist, psychiatrists are doctors, psychologists is a whole is not what you want to be.

PATIENT X413
What could the psychiatrist do for me?

FIRST DOCTOR X413
They can talk to you.  They can kind of help you work through things.

PATIENT X413
I can talk to people.  I can talk to you.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Yeah but they have a lot more.

PATIENT X413
No, no I'm more comfortable with DOCTOR.  I'll see her, if I'm in lots of pain, I'll tell her @@@ and I'll tell her.

FIRST DOCTOR X413
Alright.  So you don't have to do it, it's just an option I like to offer to people cause a lot of guys here.

PATIENT X413

FIRST DOCTOR X413

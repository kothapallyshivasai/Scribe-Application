DOCTOR X348
Okay so main issues today, medication refills, getting your meds taken care of.  We'll talk about your pain and see you know what else, if there's anything else we can do.  I want to look at your tramadol dose cause I want to make sure that.

PATIENT X348
I spoke to somebody one other time about it and we were halfway home and they even called on the cell phone and told me no I couldn't do the rest of the pills, I could only do two at one time.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
But she still won't do it at one time.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.  Well let me look.  I'm going to look and see what the maximum dose of that is because.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
What we all want is for you know.

PATIENT X348
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR X348
For the pain to go away but then have you know.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
Some other issues so, let me just see what the maximum dose for that is okay.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
What would we do without, let's see so you're taking three or four.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
Pills how many times a day?

PATIENT X348
Sometimes two and three times a day.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
A lot of times it's up through the night.  I get up out of bed at night.  Now DOCTOR gave me some other pills now.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
Put me back on amitriptyline, I think that's what you call it.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
And uh started me on two of them every night now and then we were going increase to three and then we can increase it to four.

DOCTOR X348
The amitriptyline.

PATIENT X348
Yeah and he took away the Depakote.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
The Depakote.

SECOND PERSON X348
What was that actually for?

DOCTOR X348
Amitriptyline?

SECOND PERSON X348
Yeah.

DOCTOR X348
Amitriptyline is a, it's a type of antidepressant but it's one of those medicines that helps with pain as well so it's sort of a.

PATIENT X348
Helps you sleep.

DOCTOR X348
Sort of helps with sleep, it helps with pain.  It's general class is that it's a type of antidepressant.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Um but it helps with, helps with sleep and pain um which is what it seems like its being used for here.  So the issue is the maximum dose is not to exceed 400 mg of the tramadol per day and it sounds like you're exceeding that.  You're getting, you're getting probably at least 600 if not 800 it sounds like per day.  So, we gotta do something with your pain to try to adjust this okay.  So we'll talk about, we'll talk about that.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Um alright so you've got three additional stents place in the intervening time yeah huh?

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
We'll renew.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
Now the bupropion you take.  The glipizide you take and the metformin.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
Half a tablet three times a day.  Do you know you take that one three times a day?

PATIENT X348
Uh.

DOCTOR X348
You know did you ever try that one twice a day?

PATIENT X348
Which one?

SECOND PERSON X348
Metformin.

DOCTOR X348
The metformin.

PATIENT X348
Yeah but the metformin is for diabetes.

DOCTOR X348
Yes it's for diabetes.  Normally it's a twice a day medicine so I'm just trying to think of why.

PATIENT X348
Yeah but I think it's probably because they got me cutting them in half.

DOCTOR X348
You're cutting them in half okay.

PATIENT X348
So.

DOCTOR X348
Alright so let me get these ones taken care of for you.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Okay so we're going to give you the venlafaxine.  Uh-huh.  So all our refills are running low.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
This one right here.  @@@.  The computer's running pretty slow today.

PATIENT X348
Yeah.

DOCTOR X348
Not that the computer is really hot.  Anything else going on that?

PATIENT X348
Oh I uh.

DOCTOR X348
You think I need to know about?

PATIENT X348
Now you already checked that, the x-rays of my foot?  My left foot?

DOCTOR X348

PATIENT X348
I tripped on a gate, over a gate and I almost broke my foot.  It hurt all the way to my hip.

DOCTOR X348
Huh.

PATIENT X348
And when @@@ because of the gate it got locked from the dining room to the kitchen.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
Because their little, she's only 1-year-old now.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
Cause she'll get in the dog water and the cat box.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
Everything she's not supposed to.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
So you got to put gates up.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah, when they're at that age when they get into everything.

PATIENT X348
And now she's starting to climb up the steps and she's already been up on the third one.  Going up stairs now, we got 16 steps so.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
So that gives me exercise too, going up and down.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah, uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
Which is good.

DOCTOR X348
Alright, okay.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
I just want to double check your creatinine.

PATIENT X348
Yeah.  And then if I can get your phone number just in case I need to call.

DOCTOR X348

PATIENT X348
Because otherwise you call the main hospital they send you through this way and that way and wait a minute I'll see if I can't and pretty soon your lost.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.  You know let me check, I think I forgot them at home today.  I have the number, I have a card and then I left the box at home unfortunately.  So I don't have the cards today but I'll give you the number to call.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
So here are all the medicines.

PATIENT X348
Let @@@ portion and put the phone number on there.

SECOND PERSON X348
@@@.

DOCTOR X348
Okay so.

PATIENT X348
I didn't mean that turkey @@@.

SECOND PERSON X348
@@@.

PATIENT X348
I figure what the take, what kind of medicine we take for @@@ they make it out of turkeys.

SECOND X348
@@@.

PATIENT X348
No.

DOCTOR X348
Alright.

THIRD PERSON X348
@@@ a lot.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

THIRD PERSON X348
@@@.

DOCTOR X348
Alright.

SECOND PERSON X348
That's usually @@@.

THIRD PERSON X348
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X348
@@@.

THIRD PERSON X348
@@@.

PATIENT X348
This one is not for water, the xxxzide is right?

DOCTOR X348
Well the furosemide is the water pill.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
That makes you pee and the lisinopril is a blood pressure medicine and it helps protect your kidneys when you have diabetes and you have diabetes so it's good for that too.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

THIRD PERSON X348
All this medicine, @@@.

DOCTOR X348
Now that one make sure you're on the service connection things.

PATIENT X348
Yeah.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.  Alright so your medications are all done.

PATIENT X348
I ordered them on the internet too which is cool.

DOCTOR X348
Oh good yeah that's cool.  Now the last thing I wanted to figure out is what we're gonna do about your pain because it's just not good to take so much of that tramadol.

PATIENT X348
Okay.  Now the other thing I follow which is pretty @@@ I have diabetes.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
Uh man I was really runny low.  I was getting down on my blood sugar count was down in the 50s and 60s.

DOCTOR X348
Oh okay.

PATIENT X348
But the wife give me some hard candy to eat.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
These little sucker things.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
They're all in a wrapper.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
And you take and you, I got in the habit now of sticking about eight of them at a time.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
And then I feel really good and then I don't even take that pain medicine so much.  I don't know where it works together at.

DOCTOR X348
Hmm.

PATIENT X348
Because you know it don't make any sense right?

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.  Yeah how often are you having real lows with your sugars?

PATIENT X348
Oh not too often just very seldom.

DOCTOR X348
Very seldom okay.

PATIENT X348
Yeah when I run out of candy I suck a lot of that candy all the time.

DOCTOR X348
Okay, so you don't have, you don't take insulin do you?

PATIENT X348
No I just take the pills, the glipizide and the metformin.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
That's what it's for right?

DOCTOR X348
Okay so yeah this is my thought then okay.  When we get your labs done, if your blood sugar is still as controlled as it has been in the past maybe we'll try to take the glipizide off and just do the metformin.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Because the metformin works in a little bit different way and doesn't cause any lows.

PATIENT X348
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X348
Glipizide can cause some lows.

PATIENT X348
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X348
And if you're still well controlled like you have been in the past.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
Maybe we can stop the glipizide and then check you again.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
You know in a little bit okay.

PATIENT X348
And that'll be another pill off the list right?

DOCTOR X348
Yeah and so then we just want to make sure though with the glipizide that you're eating on a regular basis.

PATIENT X348
Right, right.

DOCTOR X348
You know, eat regular meals.

PATIENT X348
Right, right.

DOCTOR X348
And things like that okay.

PATIENT X348
Right, right.  Okay.

THIRD PERSON X348
@@@.

DOCTOR X348
The physical therapist um.

PATIENT X348
Yeah that's how I got my.

DOCTOR X348
That's how you got your new scooter.

PATIENT X348
They were going to hook me up for an @@@ for that therapist had a thing for making me solar but I never heard anything back from him so.

DOCTOR X348
Let's, let me see cause I @@@.

PATIENT X348
Yeah it hurts like uh, it feels like a burning at times.  You know it'll hurt; that ache and pain, it feels like it's burning every once in a while, light burning so I don't know what that is.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
What it's got to do with that but I used to think it was my shirts once in a while but it's got to be the uh, I don't know of course then I got arthritis.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
What kind of arthritis I got, I got some other crap.

DOCTOR X348
So let's see what they thought they were gonna do.  Okay alright well maybe we'll talk about hooking you up with the physical therapist again to see if they can give you any exercises that help your pain because we're, you're not getting very good control here with the tramadol and you can't take as much of it regularly as you are.

PATIENT X348
Well the tramadol is not only for my neck and shoulders; it's for my back and my legs.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X348
Straighten the whole body out.

DOCTOR X348
Right.  So okay.  Can you take a seat up here so I can take a listen to you?

PATIENT X348
Absolutely.  Here baby.

SECOND PERSON X348
Alright.

PATIENT X348
You want me to take my jacket off?

DOCTOR X348
Uh yes please.

PATIENT X348
@@@.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
Is this good?

DOCTOR X348
Yep you're good.  Actually can you swing around so your legs are down there?  And when was the last time you got your eyes checked?

PATIENT X348
My eyes?

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
Uh I don't know they got to call me up again.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.  But you're once a year right.  You go once a year to get your eyes checked?

PATIENT X348
The main thing is for diabetes.

DOCTOR X348
Yep you want look for the diabetes.

PATIENT X348
But my eyes are so messed up.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
There's things that they should do but they're not going to do it, they're gonna leave me alone.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X348
If I'd brought my inhaler I wouldn't be in this predicament.

DOCTOR X348
Deep breaths in and out.  Can you lay back for me so I can take a look?  Your cough doesn't sound good.

SECOND PERSON X348
I know.

PATIENT X348
It's really bad and @@@.  He does that at night when we're sleeping.

SECOND PERSON X348
Oh be quiet.

PATIENT X348
It wakes me up when I'm asleep.

SECOND PERSON X348
Oh boo hoo.

PATIENT X348
It's like being in a combat zone.

SECOND PERSON X348
Boo hoo.

DOCTOR X348
Any belly pain?

PATIENT X348
Uh no not right now.  Oh yeah right there was one.

DOCTOR X348
Any @@@.

PATIENT X348
I think @@@ telling you what's wrong.  It feels like really weird here.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
Of course I got a little pain down there where @@@ I think that's where they stent was when it went in.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
And you know it's just.

DOCTOR X348
@@@ your stuff.

PATIENT X348
Yeah.

DOCTOR X348
Any swelling in your legs at all?

PATIENT X348
No.

DOCTOR X348
No.

PATIENT X348
Now this one I had a @@@ one and that's where I tripped, its turning purple, yellow.

DOCTOR X348
Is it getting better now?

PATIENT X348
Oh yes much better.  You can hardly see it now.

DOCTOR X348
Okay good.  Okay alright you can sit back up and I'm going to push that in.  Alright you can come on down here.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Hmm.  Alright so a few things @@@.  So screening things it looks like you would be due for an ultrasound of your abdomen.  Have you ever had one of those?

PATIENT X348
Uh maybe.  I don't know I've had different things done up here.  Some things multi-times but it's always good to have just in case.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.  So we recommend that once you turn 65 years old, if you smoked more than a pack of cigarettes in your entire life you should get an ultrasound of your belly to look at your aorta down in your belly to make sure that it's not dilated at all.

PATIENT X348
Oh they've already run that thing down my throat to come to find out that I have a hiatal hernia.

DOCTOR X348
Hiatal hernia.

PATIENT X348
They gave me a purple pill one time and they took it away I don't know why.

DOCTOR X348
@@@ probably.

PATIENT X348
Yeah.

DOCTOR X348
So that will look into your stomach.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Um and this is a little bit different so I think if you don't have any objections I'll just order that study.

PATIENT X348
Oh that thing that they run around your stomach with uh.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah it's like an ultrasound like they're looking for a baby in.

PATIENT X348
Yeah they put this goop on your.

DOCTOR X348
Like the same as yeah.

SECOND PERSON X348
You've already had this?

THIRD PERSON X348
Yeah of the heart.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah so you've had an ultrasound of your kidneys before.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
That's the same thing.

PATIENT X348
Not too long ago.

DOCTOR X348
The same they they just look at your aorta.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Okay um so we'll do, I'll put in the order for that.  They'll call you to set it up.

PATIENT X348
Okay.  Now instead of having that uh colonoscopy again.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
And they're supposed to.  They did it twice up here a while back.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
But instead of doing that isn't there something else they can do?

DOCTOR X348
Um.

PATIENT X348
That accomplishes the same deal?

DOCTOR X348
They can do um, we can do cards.  Let me see what your last colonoscopy showed and when you need to do it again.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
Um do you remember ever having polyps?

PATIENT X348
Uh.

DOCTOR X348
Or when you had your colonoscopy did they take any samples out or tell you anything?

PATIENT X348
I'm not sure of any of that.  Yeah cause they must have because the first time they said some were tea leaves.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.  In 2006 it looks like.

PATIENT X348
Yeah see we cheated because it was a whole two days, that's tough before you did the thing and then they did it in a different way when you drink that junk.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
And you didn't have to do the @@@ a big white bottle, they changed all that so you only did the white bottle.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
And they come to find out I guess what in the first eight inches or something like this and ask her, they got to go over something.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
They could go on up, they had a problem.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
And it hurt like a sucker.

DOCTOR X348
So it looks like, from what I can tell uh they took some biopsies but there was nothing uh.

PATIENT X348
It was clean and green.  I understand that they said I didn't have any cancer.

DOCTOR X348
Yes.  Yep.

PATIENT X348
Cancer clean.

DOCTOR X348
Yep no cancers, no cancer.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
So um they're looking no polyps, nothing in the colon so they didn't even find any polyps.  They actually just took a few biopsies cause you had been having some abdominal pain or something.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
So you had a clean colonoscopy in 2006 which means you're not due again until 2016.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
So you don't have to worry about that.

PATIENT X348
Thank you.

DOCTOR X348
Quite yet okay.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
So that's good and then the final um.

PATIENT X348
Cause the worse thing about the colonoscopy is drinking the white crap.

DOCTOR X348
You have to drink the white stuff.

PATIENT X348
And @@@.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
And you know your tushy gets so sick after drinking that crap.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah.

PATIENT X348
You know toilet paper, I don't know if the toilet paper even works right but.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.  So we're almost done here.  Um the only other thing.  So there are two things left, one is that I have to tell you I recommend highly that you stop smoking and you stop smoking and if you stop smoking and no smoking in the house, that's just for your health and everything that we know.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
It's very important.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
So if there's anything that I can do to help you with that, including setting you up with the Smoking Cessation Clinic here for uh if you are interested in nicotine patches you know I can and will provide those to you.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Um so do you want me to set any of those up for you?

PATIENT X348
Nicotine patches?

DOCTOR X348
Nicotine patch. 

PATIENT X348
Can you do that yes.

DOCTOR X348
I can.  You smoke very few cigarettes.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
So you don't.

PATIENT X348
So yeah.

DOCTOR X348
I can set you up with the lowest.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
Dose.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Of the nicotine patches.

PATIENT X348
Cause the last time I was here, the night they made me stay over.

DOCTOR X348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X348
Yeah they put nicotine patches on me too.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
I think they switched one, you know but I know that yeah they used them over here.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah okay.  So I'll do that for you.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Okay so that'll be good.

PATIENT X348
Now the wife may not actually quit but I have to.

DOCTOR X348
Yep.

PATIENT X348
I've had two strokes.

DOCTOR X348
Yep.

PATIENT X348
Two heart attacks.

DOCTOR X348
Yes.

PATIENT X348
I got four stents.

DOCTOR X348
Yep you got to quit smoking.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
You gotta quit smoking.

PATIENT X348
Okay doc.

DOCTOR X348
Okay cause you've got a lot of issues that are related.  Especially with your Agent Orange history with both of those combined.

PATIENT X348
Yeah.

DOCTOR X348
You gotta quit smoking um and then the last uh screening thing is that the VA recommends that every veteran between the ages of 18 and 120 get screened at least one time for HIV so I can order that blood test for you for the next time you come in and get labs done.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
If you don't mind.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
That'll be the 31st.

DOCTOR X348
That'll be the 31st and we'll get some labs done then.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
And I think you're up-to-date, let me check your immunizations to make sure.  You had the flu shot, you got the pneumonia shot.  Um the only other thing is for your tetanus shot, you had the tetanus shot in 2010 and those last in and of themselves 10 years before you need another booster so technically you're not due for the tetanus part until 2020 but the new tetanus vaccinations also protect against whooping cough.

PATIENT X348
Okay I'll take it.

DOCTOR X348
So I'll get you that today before you leave okay.

PATIENT X348
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Alright so we'll do that.  Alright so I'm just gonna go talk to my supervisor quick but I think your blood pressure's well controlled.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Hopefully your diabetes is as well controlled as it was back the last time it was checked but we'll check it again at the end of the month.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
If that's still okay we'll talk about going down on that glipizide.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
To make sure you know stop you from having those lows.  Um we'll get you set up with the nicotine patches, with the tetanus shot and with the triple A screen and then we'll see you back sometime soon okay.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
So let me just uh, let me just go talk to them and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT X348
Okay doc.

DOCTOR X348
I think I'm also going to try to get you hooked up with the physical therapist again cause I want to see what, if anything, they can do to help with your pain.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Alright.  Any more questions right now?

PATIENT X348
No.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X348
Okay doc.

DOCTOR X348
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
Do we need to talk about @@@.

(DOCTOR OUT:  87:37  DOCTOR IN:  95:55)

DOCTOR X348
Okay so.  Alright just like I said we're gonna do what we talked about so I'm going to order you the ultrasound of your abdomen and they'll call you to set that up.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.  They might be able to set it up for you before you leave so let me put the order in right now and see.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Um.

SECOND PERSON X348
Where does he get that shot at?

DOCTOR X348
He gets it right here before he leaves so I will put in the order okay.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
Uh if you could do it on the 31st, would you want to do it all on one day and just have?

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
Everything, let's see if they can do that.

PATIENT X348
Sure would.

DOCTOR X348
Okay so we'll do that, let me do.

PATIENT X348
So I think my appointment is at 1:30 or 2 in the afternoon.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
On the 31st.

DOCTOR X348
Okay we'll order your tetanus.  Okay and the nicotine patches.  Do you want to pick up the nicotine patches or do you want them mailed to you?

PATIENT X348
You can mail them to me.

DOCTOR X348
Mail them to you okay then I'll do that so you won't have to wait for that.  So we'll get some labs done at the end of the month when you come back.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
We'll get this triple A screen, we'll get you the tetanus shot and we'll get you the patches um and okay.

PATIENT X348
Yes.

DOCTOR X348
We refilled all of your medicines so you should be set there um how about now I'm trying to think when I want to see you back.  So how about in the next 3-4 months.

PATIENT X348
Okay that'd be fine.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
That'll be fine yes.

DOCTOR X348
And then next time I'll have my card with me and I'll give you my card but I can give you the number if you want.

PATIENT X348
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.  There's the phone number.

PATIENT X348
Excellent, alright.

DOCTOR X348
Alright and for your pain I'm going to set you up with PT again.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
Okay the Physical Therapy.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
And I want you to really try to take the tramadol as prescribed.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
I don't want to just throw medicine at you because medicines cause you know, they're not and they have other problems and so I don't want to keep just adding things to all of your pills.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
That you're already taking.

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
So if you can do your best to take the tramadol as prescribed and I'll get the physical therapy set up and then maybe they'll have some recommendations for you know stretches or treatment or something.

PATIENT X348
They've already done that twice, they come out to the house.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah and it looks like from what I could see when they came out to the house it was mostly to kind of evaluate for the scooter and that type of thing.

PATIENT X348
No I was, I had a stroke and heart attacks that's why they did it.

DOCTOR X348
Okay so they came out for that.

PATIENT X348
Now they assessed for the scooter right downstairs here.

DOCTOR X348
Yeah okay, okay.

PATIENT X348
Cause we only wanted a simple wheelchair but they wouldn't give me one.

DOCTOR X348
They wouldn't give you one yeah.  I think they thought it would have been too hard with all your cardiac issues I think they said.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
Um so we'll keep working on that okay.  

PATIENT X348
Right.

DOCTOR X348
We'll work on your pain.

PATIENT X348
Okay.

DOCTOR X348
And it'll kind of be what we talk about okay.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
And see what else we can do.

PATIENT X348
Alright.

DOCTOR X348
Okay.

PATIENT X348
Okay now I will limit the use of them things.

DOCTOR X348
Okay and at the risk of making NAME and your wife mad at me, you should both really stop smoking okay.

PATIENT X348

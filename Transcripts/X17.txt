PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
So that you know you can have the readings when you're at home.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

DOCTOR X17
Uh most of the times the readings at the hospitals are not the correct ones.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Because you walk all the way down and then you know you are already on the stressful situation.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

DOCTOR X17
And then usually that bumps it up.

PATIENT X17
Okay, right.

DOCTOR X17
So the home readings are the most helpful.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
So we discussed about the @@@.

PATIENT X17
Yeah there's another thing, I have a doctor, I have a @@@ doctor as well.  

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
They diagnosed me with asthma.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
DOCTOR and I want to say probably a month ago.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
They gave me a @@@.

DOCTOR X17
Albuterol?

PATIENT X17
It was the pink, the pink one.

DOCTOR X17
The pink one.

PATIENT X17
Yeah and I take it twice a day to control my asthma.

DOCTOR X17
Do you take it on a daily basis?

PATIENT X17
Yeah twice a day.

DOCTOR X17
What happens exactly?

PATIENT X17
Oh what happened is I was wheezing and I couldn't breathe.

DOCTOR X17
When was that?  A month back?

PATIENT X17
About a month.  I came to the Emergency Room here when it was bothering me.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
And I was coughing um severely.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And I came to this Emergency Room and the lady gave me a regular bottle, not the one that they have but a red bottle instead.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And um I take that and all it did was calm me down but they didn't do anything, anything tremendous for me.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
Then I went to my civilian doctor to find out why was I coughing so much.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And I went to St. um, St. xxx is it or St. Alexis.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
I went to St. Alexis and I did a pulmonary exam.  During my pulmonary exam I blanked out.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
Um so during that blank out the technician and the doctor said that they cannot continue the exam because I blanked out on the pulmonary exam.  I came over here to DOCTOR, down at xxx.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
At the VA Hospital and saw a doctor in there, and whatever his name, and he gave me the pulmonary doctor he gave me an exam and he said he just checked it that I do have asthma.  DOCTOR was the doctor's name.

DOCTOR X17
So you came over here at the Emergency.

PATIENT X17
Yeah.

DOCTOR X17
Was improved, is that correct?

PATIENT X17
Yep, that's right.  @@@ yep.

DOCTOR X17
Uh I don't see that in June @@@.

PATIENT X17
Was it June?

DOCTOR X17
@@@ inhalers?  Did they?

PATIENT X17
Yeah they gave me; um well they gave me something outta here.

DOCTOR X17
They gave you a nasal spray.  They gave you a spray to put in your nose?

PATIENT X17
Oh that's what they gave me?

DOCTOR X17
@@@.

PATIENT X17
Was that from the Emergency Room or was that from the doctor because I wasn't breathing good with my sleep um, with my CPAP machine?

DOCTOR X17
So @@@.  I don't see the @@@ they gave you but that is what is here.  I don't see any uh.

PATIENT X17
Okay.  I mean you might be right, it's been a while but I came to the Emergency Room cause um a constant cold that wouldn't go away.

DOCTOR X17
I get that and they gave you some antibiotics for it.

PATIENT X17
There you go; they gave me some of that.

DOCTOR X17
Yeah.

PATIENT X17
So they, so I wasn't satisfied with the Emergency Room results here.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And I was supposed to go to DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And they did some more testing which I think the VA should have done it themselves.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And they failed to do.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And then the doctor I went to see was DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
@@@ hospital.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And he diagnosed me with um asthma.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.  Okay.  Uh, typically with asthma what we see is when we listen to your chest we see something called wheezing okay.

PATIENT X17
Yes that's what I was doing, that's right and that's what I was doing too.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.  Uh, did you have asthma in the past?

PATIENT X17
Never.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.  @@@ okay, this is how it goes.  Uh, @@@ at your age @@@.  Most of the time the asthma is a @@@ of what happened during your childhood okay.  It is very rare for a person to have a new onset asthma at your age.

PATIENT X17
Right.

DOCTOR X17
Not impossible, it can happen but it is not @@@.  @@@ so what we hear is wheezing okay.  Many of the time, you have got an infection.  That also tends to relate to wheezing.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
And until that's corrected and the moment the infection gets corrected the wheezing gets corrected.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
So the thought they treating you, they give you some dramatic relief with this wheezing okay.  So all wheezing need not be asthma.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

DOCTOR X17
But then you need to be @@@ and its okay to start you on those @@@.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Today I am not able to hear any wheezing on your chest.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.  But on the days when you do do, you taking @@@ on a regular basis.

PATIENT X17
Alright.

DOCTOR X17
Because if you do it on a regular basis then you might not be @@@ okay.

PATIENT X17
Yeah.

DOCTOR X17
So @@@ I'm not going to make a diagnosis of whether you have asthma or not.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.  Uh, what I will do is that we will uh, I will talk, I will discuss with @@@ provider.

PATIENT X17
Alright.

DOCTOR X17
What would the plan be if we stopped the inhaler and can see how you do by stopping it and the moment you have the problems, you take the inhaler.

PATIENT X17
Hmm.

DOCTOR X17
They may not work well okay.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
So we can @@@ but how many times do you need to use that inhaler in a month okay?  If you need to take it more than once in a month then you might need to consider reevaluating you for asthma.

PATIENT X17
But @@@.

DOCTOR X17
Yeah.  So we can go ahead and do that okay?

PATIENT X17
Fine.  That's what I'm saying.  I think, I feel.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
That the VA should of did further evaluation for that and @@@ really know.

DOCTOR X17
Exactly no.  @@@ with the kind of story you presented of the Emergency Room, your wheezing @@@.

PATIENT X17
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X17
If I had been there, I would not have evaluated you for asthma.  What we will do is @@@.

PATIENT X17
Sure, sure. 

DOCTOR X17
And if you have an infection and I think that we will, then we cannot evaluate for asthma.

PATIENT X17
Right cause you're treating an infection.

DOCTOR X17
Exactly.

PATIENT X17
Yeah, @@@.

DOCTOR X17
Yeah.

PATIENT X17
But after the infection.

DOCTOR X17
Yes.

PATIENT X17
I should get a follow-up.

DOCTOR X17
Yes.  After the infection you gonna get a follow-up provided okay and that is what I am doing now okay.  So let us do that way, if nobody diagnosed you with asthma, I would never do a function test on you, a pulmonary function test.

PATIENT X17
Right.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.  But now since somebody diagnosed you, let's make sure that what we are dealing with is actually correct or not.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

DOCTOR X17
@@@.  So you stop using the inhaler for now.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Keep the inhaler @@@ okay.

PATIENT X17
Alright.

DOCTOR X17
And then we count the times of how many times you need it, if you need it for more than one a month then we'll get you back on the inhaler and we'll do a work-up for asthma okay?  And then we'll do a pulmonary function test to get to see what kind of lung problems okay.  It may not be asthma, maybe @@@ do that, okay?

PATIENT X17
But based on, based on DOCTOR evaluation, another civilian doctor.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
Um and he determined that DOCTOR diagnosed me with asthma.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
Based on the other doctor's assessment, can you say they do a function test?  Can you talk to your supervisor.  Cause I myself would like to get a function test, so what I want to know, I don't want to wait another month or two months.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
That look at as BS.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
Or why, look I gotta do something, I gotta go back and not hear @@@.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
I feel I got a problem and I want to rectify it.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.  What happens you believe the person @@@ asthma.

PATIENT X17
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X17
Asthma is a disease that you already carry it, okay.  Even if you have an asthma okay, but asthma may have some problem only once a month okay.  So what happens is you'll be normal, asthma attack, you get into the situation @@@ and come back to normal, you remain normal and @@@ and then you get asthma.  That's how the attack of asthma comes okay.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Now when you are normal.

PATIENT X17
Mine didn't come like that.

DOCTOR X17
@@@.

PATIENT X17
If I'm, if I'm exerting myself.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
The asthma hits me.  If I'm doing exercise.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
Or I'm walking up the stairs, my asthma hits me.

DOCTOR X17
It hits you.

PATIENT X17
If I'm having sex with my wife, the asthma hits me.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
And I'm tired of that.  I really am.

DOCTOR X17
Now.  This is another kind of asthma.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
This is the kind of asthma which call exercise-induced asthma okay.  Now if you have got these kinds of symptoms, then the best way to treat it is when you anticipate that you do the, @@@ when you are gonna get the asthma, is to take a puff before that okay.  That is typically what you do.  That's typically what you do right?

PATIENT X17
Now that's gonna be crazy, no I'm in the middle of a sex problem here, with my wife.


DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And here I'm getting an attack.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
Which it's, it's hard because I have to stop having my sex, intimate moment with my wife, it's just a problem.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X17
And it frustrates me that I can't continue this process.

DOCTOR X17
Exactly.

PATIENT X17
And you're telling me this way.  I'm saying I want the test, I want the test now.

DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
I want to get it over with.  I'm frustrated.

DOCTOR X17
Uh-huh.  If you are on a normal day okay, if you're on a normal day when you get the test.

PATIENT X17
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X17
It's gonna come normal okay.  This test is gonna be normal okay.  What we gonna.

PATIENT X17
How can you call me a date for a test when you don't know if day I'm going to have an attack or not?

DOCTOR X17
What we do is something called challenge test.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Where we give you some medication which is gonna precipitate your asthma at that time at the Lab okay and then they'll do the test.  

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
But we'll see whether you are, whether there, it is a precipitating factor okay.  Now I just wonder since now I'm seeing you for the first time okay, let me try and you know get that @@@ that you actually need it okay.  

PATIENT X17
Oh.

DOCTOR X17
A simple pulmonary function test is something which can be done anytime okay.  Challenge test is something which I can do it but that is what I'm just trying to and I'm going to analyze it but let me see how you do @@@ okay.  Now then if you need it we can schedule you on the phone and you can come out and have it okay.

PATIENT X17
Uh yeah that's cool.

DOCTOR X17
What I'm trying to do, the situation at this time is, you could stop the inhaler for now okay.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
If you do some kind of exercise and if you get short of breath at that time the next time what you do is even before you started the exercise, take that puff.  Even if you don't have symptoms.

PATIENT X17
Right.

DOCTOR X17
Now do the exercise.

PATIENT X17
Right.

DOCTOR X17
And we'll see if you get that symptoms again or not okay, okay.  If you don't get that symptoms then it gives me an idea that you are having so-called exercise-induced asthma and the only way how we control the exercise-induced asthma is by giving you medication prior to that exercise so it's not that you develop the symptoms and then you get the medication no.  If you feel that when you lift your boxes, you get asthma.

PATIENT X17
Alright.

DOCTOR X17
Then you, even before lifting the boxes you get a puff, do the exercise and @@@.

PATIENT X17
I'm not using the word exercise, anytime I walk @@@.

DOCTOR X17
Exactly.

(Knock on the door)

PATIENT X17
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X17
Well that is what I'm trying to prove to you at this time okay and I will try to, I will try to reschedule the appointment in three months, earlier if you require.  Then all you need to do is give me a call okay.  

PATIENT X17
So give me the card.

DOCTOR X17
Yeah exactly and then at that time I can actually get some idea that how many times you needed it okay and how many times it actually benefited you.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

DOCTOR X17
Okay, um this will give me some idea that which kind of test @@@ I need to put in and what type of @@@ test I need to verify.

PATIENT X17
Yeah.

DOCTOR X17
This gives me an idea of what.

PATIENT X17
Yeah.

DOCTOR X17
If I did one now, I'm sure it would come normal.

PATIENT X17
Okay.  No that's good yeah.

DOCTOR X17
@@@.  I'm going to visit with DOCTOR okay and then I'll be back in a few minutes and then we'll talk more about it.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

DOCTOR X17
Sounds good to you?

PATIENT X17
Yeah, yeah.

(DOCTOR OUT:  88:38)

SECOND DOCTOR X17
I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT X17
How ya doing sir?

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Great and yourself?

PATIENT X17
Not bad.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
My name is DOCTOR I work with DOCTOR here.  Uh we were just kind of talking a little bit about what's going on.  @@@ I'll have you sit there for a minute, @@@ formal about it.  Now um, are you a smoker?

PATIENT X17
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Have you ever smoked?

PATIENT X17
Never.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Never.  Not even pot?

PATIENT X17
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay alright um, it's just kind of weird to have asthma pop up later in life.

PATIENT X17
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
So um, DOCTOR we were talking quite a bit about what to do about this and we got a plan for it but I think ultimately you wanted to try and redo that test that sounds like they couldn't do last time.

PATIENT X17
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Did they use, was it one where they asked you to breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe?

PATIENT X17
Exactly.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Yeah.

PATIENT X17
I blanked out on that exam.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay alright.

PATIENT X17
It happened at St um, St. Alexis.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay.  Would you mind trying it again?

PATIENT X17
No I don't mind.  I want to find out what's going.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X17
I really do.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Cause you know there's other things that kind of creep into the picture you know with your obstructive sleep apnea.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
That could be affecting things.  You know, so you look like you sometimes have @@@.

PATIENT X17
Yeah around my chest.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay, what do you, what kind of stuff.

PATIENT X17
Uh I go to school right now, to auto mechanic school.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay do you notice that your shortness of breath is problematic at work?

PATIENT X17
No it's only when I do any kind activity.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
@@@.

PATIENT X17
Exactly.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay, alright.  So I think starting from scratch is reasonable.  We may not find the answer with just one test but at least we can call the decision if it's not asthma.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
It's a pretty good test.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
If we can get you through it.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Um and then in the meantime we're gonna have you stop that albuterol.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
You don't need to take it twice a day.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Um you can take it if you feel like you need it.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
If you feel like this is associated with exertion as well um you can take it um basically like half an hour to an hour before.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
You start exerting yourself so in some ways it's like pulmonary Viagra.

PATIENT X17
Yeah, okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
To dilate.  I think this happens a lot when you're with your wife.

PATIENT X17
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay so, if you think you're gonna put the moves on her you know.

PATIENT X17
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
You know it's gonna be a night where the kids are sleeping.

PATIENT X17
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
@@@.  Well not.

PATIENT X17
Yeah, a combination.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Well go ahead, exactly, exactly.  So and that might work and that's something that we can, if something definitely happens with people that you know go outside in the cold.

PATIENT X17
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
But don't be, @@@ asthma at all.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
So we got to take it one step at a time.

PATIENT X17
Okay that's fine.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
I'm gonna take a listen to you now.

PATIENT X17
Sure.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Um, the main thing is DOCTOR was telling me a little bit about your survey.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Seems that they do, it's verbal.  Looks like you're gonna see Mental Health.

PATIENT X17
No I was seeing DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR X17
Okay.  Who gave you that @@@.

PATIENT X17

PATIENT X17

FIRST DOCTOR X17

PATIENT X17
Sure.

FIRST DOCTOR X17

PATIENT X17
Before activity.

FIRST DOCTOR X17

PATIENT X17

PATIENT X17
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
So let us just start with this.

PATIENT X17
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
We don't think it triggers the asthma.

PATIENT X17
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X17

PATIENT X17
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
If this comes back normally then there are other things to worry about.  I'll be talking to you at that point.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
Yeah that's fine.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
Uh apart from that, I don’t’ have anything for you.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
All we can do is when you check-out uh you can ask them how to review this.

PATIENT X17
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
It's very lengthy @@@, now.

PATIENT X17
Okay.  Doctor, uh I ran out of my Levitra.  Is there any way um the doctor could recommend my Levitra back?

FIRST DOCTOR X17

PATIENT X17
Only @@@ I don't have it every day.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
@@@.

PATIENT X17
No, yeah I had it before.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17
Uh with doctor, I think @@@ gave me.

FIRST DOCTOR X17
Okay.

PATIENT X17

FIRST DOCTOR X17

PATIENT X17
And DOCTOR was my meds doctor.

FIRST DOCTOR X17

FIRST DOCTOR X17

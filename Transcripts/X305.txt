DOCTOR X305
PATIENT?

PATIENT X305
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X305
Hello.

PATIENT X305
How you doing?

DOCTOR X305
Alright, how have you been doing?

PATIENT X305
Doing pretty good.

DOCTOR X305
Alright.  Issues, concerns, complaints?

PATIENT X305
Well I'm down to 167 so that's seven pounds I've lost.

DOCTOR X305
From 267, you're weight.

PATIENT X305
That's what I mean, 167 is what I want to be.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.  How much have you lost?

PATIENT X305
Seven pounds since the last time I saw you, which ain't a lot but.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.  How's the smoking going?

PATIENT X305
I got a patch on.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
I got the gum in my mouth and I'm taking that pill.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah when was the last time you smoked?

PATIENT X305
Last weekend, not this past weekend but last weekend I had a puff off of one.  I'd forgotten how bad the stuff makes the cigarettes taste.

DOCTOR X305
Taste.

PATIENT X305
I had one puff and gave the cigarette back to the guy.

DOCTOR X305
Okay.  I saw you went to the Diabetes Classes and completed all that and it all went well.  

PATIENT X305
I meant to bring that worksheet with my blood pressure.

DOCTOR X305
Oh your sugar.

PATIENT X305
Glucose readings on it.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.  You been checking it?  How have they been running?

PATIENT X305
Uh a couple of times they've been a little high but each time it was higher than it's supposed to be I stop and thought back and found the reason why.

DOCTOR X305
What you ate.

PATIENT X305
And uh normally it's right within the guidelines.  

DOCTOR X305
I'll have you stop by the Lab so you can get labs done.  Did you eat today this morning already?

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
You did okay.  I still might have you go down and just get one of the lab tests.  I just kind of want to see where your diabetes shifts your numbers at and see how you come out and what we've been doing on that.  

PATIENT X305
I've changed my dietary habits.

DOCTOR X305
Diet say you have changed your diet.

PATIENT X305
I'm eating my big meal at lunch now.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
Instead of in the evenings and I have a salad for my evening meal.

DOCTOR X305
Very good.

PATIENT X305
Which my Coumadin doctor and I are working hard to.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah that can, yeah that can be one thing, salads especially something with spinach and things like that can cause those.

PATIENT X305
Those green veggies.  But it's not that far off and we'll get it caught, adjusted here soon.  

DOCTOR X305
I needed to look at all you had.  Through your meds, and it's got the gum and all that stuff, you're using that.  You're using your inhaler still.

PATIENT X305
That reminds me.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
That new inhaler they sent me.  That one.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
Uh that seems to me that it's for more for asthma than COPD from what I've heard.

DOCTOR X305
No you can use Symbicort for.

PATIENT X305
And I've also heard that that's not, it's got some nasty side effects.  I don't know if it's true or not but I thought I'd check.

DOCTOR X305
This one you've been on, they haven't changed anything, let's see is this the one that we changed?

PATIENT X305
Yeah this is the new one to replace my formoterol and the other one.

DOCTOR X305
So the formoterol and mometasone.  Cause I know the VA has been changing around some of these inhalers.  Did they send you a note saying that?

PATIENT X305
Yeah and then about two weeks ago I got this.

DOCTOR X305
Okay.  Have you used it at all?

PATIENT X305
No I'm still finishing off the last of my.

DOCTOR X305
I mean it's a similar, different medication but they use the same thing so the side effects and profile should be the same.

PATIENT X305
But it said, it said in the directions not to take this more than twice a day.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah so this one you don't want to take this more than twice a day.  No this is more of your kind of your maintenance one.  The one that you can take if you need is the albuterol, if you need.  You got acute shortness of breath?

PATIENT X305
The uh.

DOCTOR X305
The Combivent or the albuterol ipratropium.  You have two inhalers correct?

PATIENT X305
Is that the pink one?

DOCTOR X305
I'm not sure what color it is.

PATIENT X305
Where you screw the top off or is it a.

DOCTOR X305
Oh probably more like this one.

PATIENT X305
Well that, this is replacing that.

DOCTOR X305
Which should be replacing.

PATIENT X305
Two things.

DOCTOR X305
Let's see if I can find the Pharmacy note, it'll show.  Yeah so this is replacing formoterol the capsule one that you were doing.

PATIENT X305
Right.

DOCTOR X305
That's what this one is replacement.  So that one, this is the one you should be taking um as the not as needed one but as you take as a control medication.  The one that you should take if you get short of breath is the other one which is the puffer, the Combivent.

PATIENT X305
I thought that it said that this was replacing.

DOCTOR X305
No this one's replacing.

PATIENT X305
Two of my.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah it's got two medications.  Its two medications but they're all together.

PATIENT X305
Yeah but, it, I thought it said that this was replacing two of them, the formoterol and the puffer.

DOCTOR X305
No, no.  The one that it's replacing is the same @@@.  Yeah so before you were on a combination one, formoterol and mometasone.  Budesonide.  So oh yeah you're right on that.  So you should still have the other inhaler though.  Yeah you're right so you were on the formoterol and the mometasone inhaler so it's those two inhalers but you had three inhalers right?  You had also the Combivent.

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
So this was replacing the formoterol and the mometasone and getting this one box now and that one is the one you take just long-acting twice a day and then you should still have the Combivent which is albuterol and ipratropium, that's the one you use but yeah basically those two medications in this are similar and one is exactly the same as formoterol is still in here and mometasone is the steroid and this is a different steroid, budesonide which is also a steroid but it's exactly the same so that's how that should work now.

PATIENT X305
Okay then I will still have that other puffer?

DOCTOR X305
You'll still have the other one for as needed, the Combivent.

PATIENT X305
In case.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.

PATIENT X305
Okay.  I can live with that.

DOCTOR X305
Sorry I was a little confused.

PATIENT X305
So was I.

DOCTOR X305
Are you still taking the Lasix?  Furosemide?

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
I think actually the last time I told you to start taking that potassium?

PATIENT X305
Yes.

DOCTOR X305
So I believe the potassium was low so that's one of the things I want to do is to check and see where your potassium is and we may have to go up depending on where it's at.  I'm just reordering.  You're on the lisinopril still, and you're taking the niacin still?

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
And Topamax, Coumadin, the Coumadin Clinic is following you for that and you're on the simvastatin still.

PATIENT X305
Yep.

DOCTOR X305
And you're on the metformin.  Are you still taking the glucosamine and the aspirin?

PATIENT X305
I don't take any glucosamine any more but I take the aspirin.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah right.  

PATIENT X305
It's the baby.

DOCTOR X305
Yep that's the one for the cardiovascular.

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
xxxefit okay.  I think that's the medications list for now.  No fevers, chills, night sweats?

PATIENT X305
I have night sweats all the time.

DOCTOR X305
You do sweat at night?

PATIENT X305
Uh but it's hot in my apartment.

DOCTOR X305
Oh I see.  It's hotter right now.

PATIENT X305
I haven't got it adjusted for summer yet so.

DOCTOR X305
Any problems with vision, eyes?  No.  No chest pain, shortness of, do you get short of breath on occasion?

PATIENT X305
Occasionally.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.

PATIENT X305
Hopefully not as much now that I've quit smoking.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah totally that'll help with the shortness of breath.  Diarrhea, constipation?

PATIENT X305
Since I've changed my eating habits.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
My bowel movements have changed considerably.  I feel like I'm a little constipated for a couple of days and then I'm fine.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.

PATIENT X305
But I think it's more that I'm not constipated it's just that I don't eat as much.

DOCTOR X305
Sure.

PATIENT X305
So I don't have to go as much.

DOCTOR X305
So less in, less out.  Uh urination problems, problems urinating?

PATIENT X305
Taking 160 mg of furosemide.

DOCTOR X305
Lasix yeah.  How's the swell, do you have swelling, how is the swelling?

PATIENT X305
It's gone.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.

PATIENT X305
I keep it under control.  

DOCTOR X305
Under control.

PATIENT X305
And that's also for the water around my heart they tell me.

DOCTOR X305
Okay.

PATIENT X305
So.

DOCTOR X305
Do you see Cardiology?  Do you see Cardiology here?

PATIENT X305
Uh probably.  I've seen just about everybody.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah, yeah.  Take a look.  You've been taking 1000 mg of the metformin right?  So you have been taking that, we got repeat labs in January.  We had saw improvement, I think I talked to you it went from 8.6, your sugar, your three month sugar number went from 8.9 to 7.5 on the metformin so that improved but we might add another medication here today if you're still not, our goal is for you to be below 7 and you're at 7.5.  Probably one more medication will probably have you be closer to making your goal.  And you saw Ophthalmology and that was here recently, the eye doctors.

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
A few days ago.

PATIENT X305
Yep.

DOCTOR X305
They said your eyes didn't have any diabetic changes and you saw Podiatry on the 12th there and your bladder, you saw, you just had a procedure done by your urologist and it doesn't look like they saw anything suspicious.

PATIENT X305
Right.

DOCTOR X305
Or anything as far as that goes.  Your blood pressure looks good today.  Your a fib.  Your heart rate is controlled.  Overall you feel like your breathing is relatively stable, the COPD is managing better.

PATIENT X305
I get out of breath if I walk very far.  

DOCTOR X305
How far can you go before you get out of breath?

PATIENT X305
Depends on how fast I'm walking.  Uh half a block, a block.

DOCTOR X305
Half a block okay.  No chest pain though.

PATIENT X305
No.

DOCTOR X305
You just get short of breath.  Work on the smoking, pneumonia, you got the flu shot.  I know before you were not interested in the colonoscopy in the past, still not interested in it?  Okay.  Um let me see immunization wise you had a tetanus done.  So the only other vaccine that I'd recommend right now would be, have you ever heard of shingles?

PATIENT X305
I've had shingles.

DOCTOR X305
You've had it.  How long did you have it?

PATIENT X305
Before I come here and all I had was one little spot right up here.

DOCTOR X305
Is that right.

PATIENT X305
And it didn't hurt.

DOCTOR X305
Oh really.

PATIENT X305
But I didn't know what it was so the doctors eventually took a sample.

DOCTOR X305
Sample of it.

PATIENT X305
Sample of it and then he sent me to somebody who specialized in it.

DOCTOR X305
Oh.

PATIENT X305
Something like that and he gave me some medications.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah so if you've had it before and it was not painful though for you.

PATIENT X305
No it wasn't.

DOCTOR X305
Generally it's really painful.

PATIENT X305
That's why I didn't think that's what I had.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah so generally it's painful.  I mean since you've had it once before it could possibly come back.  I don't know but there is a vaccine, they have a shingles vaccine that's out now.  Again it doesn't guarantee that it won't happen but it should decrease your risk by 75% of it reoccurring.  It's a one time shot if you're interested in that.  We could do that today.

PATIENT X305
Um I got no problem with it.

DOCTOR X305
With it, okay.  Then otherwise you're up-to-date on your pneumonia, the tetanus and you're good for the year so I'll put that in and you can get it on the way out the door here today.  

PATIENT X305
Before I go anywhere I'm going to have to go to the john.

DOCTOR X305
Sure.

PATIENT X305
Not right now but.

DOCTOR X305
Okay yeah.  When I got to go talk to them I'll look you over here and then I'll go talk to the docs outside the door you can probably come on back and then I think I'll have you go downstairs and get those labs drawn today to make sure @@@ and all that's where it should be.  Using the CPAP still at night?

PATIENT X305
Yes.

DOCTOR X305
That's working.

PATIENT X305
I cannot lay down without it.

DOCTOR X305
Your shortness of breath.

PATIENT X305
I get real.

DOCTOR X305
Do you sleep with pillow propped up at night or can you lay flat on your back to sleep?

PATIENT X305
Uh I've got one small pillow.

DOCTOR X305
You sleep on it.

PATIENT X305
That I have my head on.

DOCTOR X305
Sure.

PATIENT X305
And but I sleep on my back, my sides, my stomach.  I'm a restless sleeper.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah okay.  Could you have a seat over on the table for me?  

PATIENT X305
I got this one on.

DOCTOR X305
And I think if we can keep moving in the right direction, not actively smoking and keep hold of that and keep losing weight.  You know I mean it takes time and you didn't put all that weight on you know cause we're pretty much going through the process.

PATIENT X305
I put, I weighed 185 and I quit smoking the first time.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
And in 30 days I gained 60 pounds.

DOCTOR X305
Wow.

PATIENT X305
But I had those pretzel rods in my mouth all the time.  I was eating candy.  I was eating anything I could get my hands on and the bad thing is it's all around the organ fat.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah, yeah, this is the bad kind of fat yeah.  The central obesity is what the name is.  Unfortunately that's the kind associated with all the risks of the heart disease.

PATIENT X305
Yep.

DOCTOR X305
And all that, that's it.

PATIENT X305
But back then I was working still so.

DOCTOR X305
Hmm.

PATIENT X305
It wasn't so bad.

DOCTOR X305
I'll take a listen here to you.  Take a listen to the lungs, deep breath for me.  

PATIENT X305
@@@.

DOCTOR X305
Unfortunately they don't get the air in here at all.  I think we're not used to having 80 degree weather in March.  Open your mouth for me okay.  

PATIENT X305
All my teeth.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.  Pain with any of them there?

PATIENT X305
Uh I had some a while back and they pulled it.

DOCTOR X305
Pulled it.  Where do you work on it, do you go to the VA or do you go?

PATIENT X305
Well they pulled it because it was an emergency because I don't have dental coverage.

DOCTOR X305
What's your, are you service-connected here at all?  No, yeah.  Yeah you can't go to the Dental Clinic here unless you have some service-connected I think it's pretty much @@@.

PATIENT X305
No I was stationed in the middle of Kansas.  At a south base.

DOCTOR X305
So that's not too far away.

PATIENT X305
No.  As a matter of fact my grandmother lived in that town.

DOCTOR X305
Is that right?  Let me take a look at your legs here.  They're not too bad.

PATIENT X305
Before I started taking the furosemide.

DOCTOR X305
That big around?

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
That's keeps them in check huh.  Yeah the swelling is very minimal.  How long you been on the furosemide for?

PATIENT X305
Yeah.

DOCTOR X305
Check your feet and all that?

PATIENT X305
I have a podiatrist that comes in to the uh housing complex I live.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
He volunteers his time two Saturdays a month.

DOCTOR X305
Okay, so you keep a close eye on the feet.

PATIENT X305
The only doctor I see that's not VA and he's free.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.  Well that's nice of him to volunteer his time.  No pain anywhere in the belly or anything like that?

PATIENT X305
Nope.

DOCTOR X305
Well alright.

PATIENT X305
Considering the shape I'm in, I'm healthy as a horse.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.  @@@ feel too bad @@@.

PATIENT X305
I get along with the people in the complex.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
We uh go out to dinner once a month; out to lunch I should say.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
And they have dinners at the complex once a month.  I belong to the @@@ Club and they have a dinner once a month.

DOCTOR X305
Great.

PATIENT X305
So I get, three times a month I eat with somebody else.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
And then I got to make good friends with one fella and he and I go out every now and then.  

DOCTOR X305
Good.  You ever been on fish oil, taking fish oil?

PATIENT X305
Yes I have.

DOCTOR X305
Were you having a bad, you know why you stopped it?

PATIENT X305
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR X305
You don't know why you stopped it?

PATIENT X305
Couldn't afford it.

DOCTOR X305
Oh couldn't afford it okay.

PATIENT X305
I was getting, it wasn’t something.

DOCTOR X305
It wasn't through the VA?

PATIENT X305
Right.

DOCTOR X305
You weren't getting it.  I think you can get it through the VA.  I mean your cholesterol, as far as your numbers go, the ones that we had from before, your LDL is your bad cholesterol, that goal is where it should be.  Your HDL is pretty low; it should be above 40 so you're at 15 which is really low.  I know medication will help you get it stabilized due to the central obesity and it can also be a lot of that can be familial in other words the family.  So I think we can try to get it up a few extra points but let me go ask one of the other doctors.  If you need to use the restroom, you can step outside and you can use the restroom.

PATIENT X305
@@@.

DOCTOR X305
@@@.

PATIENT X305
Yeah.  I did this the last time I was here.

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:25  DOCTOR IN:  59:59)

DOCTOR X305
Alright.

PATIENT X305
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I saw you on December 4th.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
On December 9th we had ice out in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X305
I slipped on the ice and broke my arm.

DOCTOR X305
Is that right?

PATIENT X305
Right there.

DOCTOR X305
Oh did you heal up?  Where'd you go for that?

PATIENT X305
Came up here for it.

DOCTOR X305
Oh did you?

PATIENT X305
I come here for everything.

DOCTOR X305
They put you in a cast?

PATIENT X305
They, I was in the splint for a week and then two different casts and then a splint that I could take off and exercise five times a day.

DOCTOR X305
I see that, alright that's Ortho, oh yeah.  I think I remember seeing that.  So how's the arm feeling since then?

PATIENT X305
It's still a little weak but getting better.  The more I use it the better it is.  68 years old, that's the first time I ever broke a bone.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah.

PATIENT X305
But don't let me near something sharp cause I got more scar tissue than you got hair.

DOCTOR X305
Um alright, let's see a couple things.  So we talked to you, I'm sorry I'm going to start you on one more medication to try and get the diabetes under control.  I'm going to try and switch to there's something called gliptin which is one of the non-formularies and I'd use it than using the other one so I'm going to put through to see if you can get it through here.  Alright so I'm putting it as a non-formulary medication, while you should use a formulary @@@ we'll use one of the other ones called glipizide which is the other one medication you can use.  This one is just a little bit better, it has a little mild maybe weight loss advantage, more of a weight control but we will see uh I can't guarantee how @@@.  Still the government unfortunately.

PATIENT X305
Yep.

DOCTOR X305
Um but I'll put it in here.  So and then I'll call you and let you know.

PATIENT X305
Okay.

DOCTOR X305
Either way, if it is it's a once a day medication they'll send out and it @@@ good.  If not I will call and make them send the other one.  And then the only other thing I've got to bring up is your lipids.  I think we also need to start taking the fish oil again, if you're getting that through the VA and taking the fish oil.

PATIENT X305
Sure.

DOCTOR X305
That doesn't have much side effect and it might help a little bit with your lipids.  So I'll let you know, take one of these twice a day capsule and the only other thing, did anyone ever talk to you about the MOVE Program?  This is a diet program, exercise program.  I don't know if you'd be interested in that, it's here at the VA.  I think it's on Tuesday for eight weeks in a row or something.  I don't know how hard it is for you to get in the MOVE and come back.

PATIENT X305
It's a long way.

DOCTOR X305
Oh is it okay.

PATIENT X305
xxx xxx, do you know where that's at?

DOCTOR X305
Uh-huh so you're quite a ways away oh, okay.

PATIENT X305
About 40 miles.

DOCTOR X305
Sure.  Oh you're a ways off so that's not reasonable.

PATIENT X305
Which is why I often go down to Rubinay for the blood draws.

DOCTOR X305
That's right; I know you had said that before.  So we'll make those changes.  Stop by and get the labs here today cause I want to see, so go to the lab right now since you're not fasting we might need a little bit of adjusting on that.  Uh and then we'll bring you back again in about two months to kind of see how things are going with the diabetes um and we'll do that shingles vaccine today and labs today.  Alright.

PATIENT X305
Sounds good to me.

DOCTOR X305
@@@.  Let me get you out and let me find a nurse here to give you that vaccine and then we'll get you to the Lab.  (Doctor talks to nurse)  We'll find someone here to do the vaccine and we'll get you out of here okay?

PATIENT X305
Sounds good to me.  Take care.

DOCTOR X305
Yeah you too.

PATIENT LEAVES:  68:09

Time is @@@

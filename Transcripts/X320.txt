DOCTOR X320
PATIENT?

PATIENT X320
Yep.

DOCTOR X320
Hi how you doing?

PATIENT X320
Fine how are you?

DOCTOR X320
Alright.  I didn't know that they were doing the surgery that quick.

PATIENT X320
Surprised huh? 

DOCTOR X320
Yeah and I know that they were talking about you had a follow-up @@@.

PATIENT X320
Yeah they uh, well there was confusion cause actually in October I said let's go forward with it.

DOCTOR X320
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X320
And somehow it got screwed up and it didn't actually end up when I wanted to do it cause I wanted to do it in December.  They were telling me it was gonna be two months worth of therapy and whatever and I just figured.

DOCTOR X320
Do it during the winter.

PATIENT X320
Yeah.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.

PATIENT X320
But there wasn't that much weather, we didn't have a winter.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah, that's right.  So you were up doing on the Rehab Floor for a little while too?

PATIENT X320
Yeah.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  Uh how are things going, for instance are you able to walk around?

PATIENT X320
Yeah.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.

PATIENT X320
The only reason I'm using the walker is between downstairs and the Rehab, up here and back down and whatever @@@ here but um yeah I'm not up to walking that much yet.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.  When do you have follow up with the surgeons?

PATIENT X320
Uh the 6th of April I believe it is.

DOCTOR X320
Okay that's like a couple of weeks.

PATIENT X320
Yeah.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  Alright and I also saw you were in the ER just last week.

PATIENT X320
Yep they were dealing with an infection, they said the @@@ was probably due @@@ while I was in the service.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah, probably.  @@@.

PATIENT X320
@@@.

DOCTOR X320
Are you still taking the antibiotics yet?

PATIENT X320
Uh yeah I got four more pills.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  Your blood pressure looks good today.  It's been you know, our main concerned with the aneurysm.

PATIENT X320
Right.

DOCTOR X320
So you're still going to have good blood pressure.

PATIENT X320
Sure.

DOCTOR X320
It still looks good today.

PATIENT X320
And uh the other thing that I am taking as far as the medications that I've gotten the list for, I'm taking the amlodipine.

DOCTOR X320
10 mg?

PATIENT X320
Yep.  The metoprolol.

DOCTOR X320
Do you use Vicodin?

PATIENT X320
Yep.

DOCTOR X320
Good.

PATIENT X320
And uh the calcium.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.

PATIENT X320
And then I'm finishing out the antibiotics.  I'm not taking any of the other medications.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  So you're not taking the lisinopril?

PATIENT X320
Nope.

DOCTOR X320
Okay and you're not taking simvastatin?

PATIENT X320
Nope.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.

PATIENT X320
Changed my diet, I'm eating less than, staying off of the red meat, four or five times a week at the most.  I'm eating mostly fish and chicken and a lot of nuts and grains and stuff generally to watch the cholesterol.  I just don't want to be on the cholesterol medications.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  Was your cholesterol pretty bad before?

PATIENT X320
No.  I was just @@@ blood pressure.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.  Are you still having problems with your vision in the left eye?

PATIENT X320
Oh a little.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.

PATIENT X320
Nothing.

DOCTOR X320
Are you still seeing the eye doc?

PATIENT X320
I'm probably due to for another appointment, he told me to come back in the spring of this year so, I'm probably due.

DOCTOR X320
You know I wonder if it's not, let me see what the surgeon said.  You're blood pressure's not bad but your pulse is a little bit low, 56 cause before it would have been ideal.  Uh do you ever feel like you get pauses in your, like do you ever get lightheaded or dizzy?

PATIENT X320
I'm @@@ today but that seemed like when I work out and they're trying to get me straightened out.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.

PATIENT X320
Other than that no.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  

PATIENT X320
And the, I'm gonna say the metoprolol um if I end up taking it within a 12 hour span, my uh pulse seems to be much more stronger and I think increased in rate as well.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  Did you ever do those cards?

PATIENT X320
Yeah I sent them in.

DOCTOR X320
The cards I sent, @@@.

PATIENT X320
I figured no news was good news.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.  I don't see it at all.

PATIENT X320
Oh.

DOCTOR X320
How are you feeling in terms of @@@ urination with the prostate?

PATIENT X320
Fine.  I mean I'm probably up a little more often than usual.  At night I'm probably up twice during the night but I don't have any problem going or anything like that.

DOCTOR X320
Well it looks like your PSA has been up a little bit, the numbers that we check the prostate with.  @@@.  When was the last time I saw you?

PATIENT X320
Uh I believe it was in October, probably I think the 7th.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.  This February your PSA was a 7, up from 5 back in 2010.  That's a huge jump.

PATIENT X320
Uh also when they put me on a mostly regimented medication, I stop taking my saw palmetto.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  Were you ever, did we ever have you on finasteride or Flomax?

PATIENT X320
Uh no I was on Flomax with my other doctor for a while.

DOCTOR X320
How many times in the night were up when you were using that?

PATIENT X320
Usually once.

DOCTOR X320
No weak stream or hesitancy?

PATIENT X320
No.

DOCTOR X320
Do feel like your bladder is completely emptying?

PATIENT X320
Yeah.  When I gotta go, I gotta go and it's over.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.  Did you have a CT @@@?

PATIENT X320
@@@.

DOCTOR X320
They were supposed to do that chest CT some time around now to see if that mass has changed.

PATIENT X320
They did a CT just prior to the surgery.

DOCTOR X320
Oh.

PATIENT X320
And they said that they basically should be able to see if from that.  I believe it would've been February 10th.

DOCTOR X320
I see one January 13th, preop, so that was for the preop work-up.  Okay it looks like it was unchanged.  Well maybe they called that one mass at the outside hospital at a centimeter and a half and then when we rechecked it, it was down to 5 millimeters, it was about a third of the size and then now it's down to 3-4 millimeters so it's probably something we'd want to check again.  It's certainly not getting bigger, if anything it's getting smaller so.  Are you still taking the aspirin?

PATIENT X320
I haven't been, they didn't want me to take it before surgery and I haven't started taking it again.  

DOCTOR X320
What about that bacteria that grew out of your urine looks like the antibiotic @@@.  And you didn't have fevers, chills or anything like that, any back, low back pain?

PATIENT X320
Yeah after therapy.

DOCTOR X320
After therapy alright, okay.  How are you doing with your medicines, do you have plenty of refills?

PATIENT X320
Yeah and just when I went to the hospital they gave me another bottle plus I had them at home so I'm good for a couple of three months.  

DOCTOR X320
I'll take a look at you.  Have you been having any chest pain or trouble breathing?

PATIENT X320
Nope.

DOCTOR X320
You can have a seat right there.

PATIENT X320
Okay.

DOCTOR X320
Take a deep breath.  Any swelling in your hands or feet?

PATIENT X320
No.

DOCTOR X320
You have a surgical scar down here?

PATIENT X320
Yeah.  Cut myself.

DOCTOR X320
You don't @@@ do you?  Oh gee that's healing nice.  Got those stitches already out, so you haven't noticed any drainage or anything like that out of it?

PATIENT X320
Um a couple times there was a little but once the stitches were it seemed like it was all over but that was the way it was @@@.

DOCTOR X320
No it looks good.  Well you know, it's probably not a terrible pain.  @@@ quit taking the lisinopril.  The only thing I worry about is the metoprolol is what's called beta blockers and actually we use that to slow down people's heart rate and the blood pressure so we were @@@.

PATIENT X320
Oh.

DOCTOR X320
So by @@@ you know maybe the lisinopril would be better than metoprolol because, @@@ because it slows your heart down a bit.  It's probably good to cut back on the dose of @@@.  I'll kind of run that by my boss today.

PATIENT X320
Oh.

DOCTOR X320
Let's see @@@.

PATIENT X320
Now the um metoprolol um like you say if I go @@@ unusual problem or something I end up like 14 hours between the pills then uh I mean I noticed the heart beat getting different.

DOCTOR X320
Really.

PATIENT X320
Is there a um a point where that would back off, I mean.

DOCTOR X320
@@@.

PATIENT X320
No because it's, I mean I can feel it.

DOCTOR X320
Hmm.

PATIENT X320
Whenever the when the @@@ like right now I don't even feel it, but like I say if I go 14 or 15 hours without it, uh I mean I have gone uh like on a trip or something and gone 18 hours then obviously it doesn't seem to get any worse or I just, I don't know what it did I never really paid any attention.

DOCTOR X320
Hmm.  When was the last time you saw Cardiology?

PATIENT X320
DOCTOR. 

DOCTOR X320
Alright give me about five minutes so I can go chat with my boss real quick.

PATIENT X320
Okay.

DOCTOR X320
I'll be right back.

PATIENT X320
No problem.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:25  DOCTOR IN:  51:00)

DOCTOR X320
Alright.  Well here's what I want to do.  Blood pressure is really good.  We're shooting for less than 130 and we certainly got that on the top number.  The bottom number is actually a little bit low.  But if you don't have any symptoms, it's probably not a huge deal but kind of like this low number and your heart rate being a little bit low, you're just kind of on the fence so.  We'll just stick with this.  You're not taking lisinopril right?

PATIENT X320
Right.

DOCTOR X320
So thinking about maybe just cutting back on the metoprolol.  So you're taking 100.

PATIENT X320
It's a stiff pill, just got to break it in half.

DOCTOR X320
Are you asking me?  Yeah.

PATIENT X320
Okay.

DOCTOR X320
So yeah, right now you're taking a pill twice a day so just take a half pill twice a day.

PATIENT X320
Yeah.

DOCTOR X320
Should be 12 hours though.

PATIENT X320
Sure.

DOCTOR X320
Uh so we'll monitor you after that.  And the simvastatin if you don't want to take it and you want to try the diet and exercise I think that's okay.

PATIENT X320
The exercise is definitely gonna help because I didn't exercise at all before and now at least I'm back to.

DOCTOR X320
And you're right on the borderline of your goal cholesterol so you know I don't think there's any problem.

PATIENT X320
How's my good cholesterol?

DOCTOR X320
We haven't, we didn't check it.  We'll probably check it next time because you're on the borderline.  You know I honestly would like to see you on the medication but with diet and exercise it may come down but the next time you come back we'll check it.

PATIENT X320
Okay.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.

PATIENT X320
Next time, I'll see if I can't do it with diet and exercise then I'm okay with it.  Cause I used to be on it and still it was up cause then you will know.  You know if diet and exercise aren't doing it, the pills are doing it.

DOCTOR X320
Um and then @@@.

PATIENT X320
It runs in the family.

DOCTOR X320
What does?

PATIENT X320
@@@.

DOCTOR X320
Okay.  Um so I don't need to see you back for maybe about three months.  I would like for you to come back in the next two or three weeks to take a blood pressure.

PATIENT X320
Okay, that might work cause I'm coming in twice a week for therapy.

DOCTOR X320
Oh okay, alright good.  So you'll be here next week?

PATIENT X320
Yep.

DOCTOR X320
So we'll check it next week.  In fact you can get it done before you go to therapy just come up here and tell the nurses you're here for a blood pressure check and she'll take your blood pressure and you go and you won't have to wait.

PATIENT X320
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR X320
@@@.  We're basically cutting the metoprolol in half so I want to make sure it doesn't go high now you know.  I don't think it will but we'll check it and I think it'll be fine but.

PATIENT X320
Oh if I notice any really change in the heart rate or anything I guess I'll call and tell you.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.  Yeah, tell me if you have any symptoms.  So those stool cards, I don't know what happened.  I think there's @@@ because your blood count was so low that and with the stool cards, they probably wouldn't accept them anyway and I don't know what happened but you actually need the actual colonoscopy so.  @@@.

PATIENT X320
Let's wait till I get straightened out a little bit here first.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah, yeah, we will wait on that for a few months okay.

PATIENT X320
Okay.

DOCTOR X320
Okay, let me, give me just a couple more minutes.

PATIENT X320
Pardon?

(DOCTOR OUT:  56:02  DOCTOR IN:  60:16)

DOCTOR X320
Alright.  We have a few changes we were making @@@.

PATIENT X320
Okay.

DOCTOR X320
Otherwise, I'll see you back in about four months and you've got a follow-up with the surgeons right?

PATIENT X320
Right.

DOCTOR X320
@@@.  And you'll finish physical therapy.

PATIENT X320
Yep.  That's my goal.  My goal is to not @@@ not to go @@@ until I'm able to stand up and walk again.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.

PATIENT X320
And I'm.

DOCTOR X320
Um next time you come in we'll check, we'll check your cholesterol and we'll check your blood count.  You know your blood count's low.  It's probably because you had the surgery and you lose blood whenever you have a surgery and that can make it low.

PATIENT X320
I actually got a transfusion and iron because it was low.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah so um, it probably was a little bit low but we'll see where it's at compared to today um.

PATIENT X320
And they took four vials of blood on Saturday in the Emergency Room I don't know what they were checking for but you should have some information.

DOCTOR X320
These are going to be four months from now so uh, yeah you don't have to worry about this before the next appointment and we'll be able to do some labs.  Uh you know, we're going to check it, PSA @@@ it did go up high, pretty high but.

PATIENT X320
It's always been high.

DOCTOR X320
Exactly so I mean, it could be prostate cancer but given you've had no BPH.

PATIENT X320
My original position.

DOCTOR X320
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X320
I wasn't @@@.

DOCTOR X320
That's what I mean, I mean sometimes we can see a bump because you had other, @@@ in February you were in the hospital so if you had a catheter in that trauma can raise your @@@ so we'll check your PSA again when you come back in four months and that should give your prostate some time to settle down.

PATIENT X320
And I'll go back on the saw palmetto and see what.

DOCTOR X320
Right.

PATIENT X320
Now it was 9.8, that would have been probably maybe 12 years ago, I went on saw palmetto then and it dropped it from 9.8 to 3.4.

DOCTOR X320
Oh is that right?  Well we'll see what happens then.  Alright I think everything is fine.  Alright so we'll see you back in four months.  Good luck with the uh with the therapy.

PATIENT X320
Yeah the next time maybe I won't use this.  Well I said maybe, I'll definitely be doing it, can @@@ maybe.

DOCTOR X320
Alright, do you want me to show you the way out?

PATIENT X320
Yeah if you don't mind, I don't want to tear your doors up and everything else.

DOCTOR X320
Sure.  I'm going to see you now.

PATIENT X320
And check out at this.

DOCTOR X320
Yeah.

PATIENT X320
Okay.  Forward I can do pretty good.  Backwards I don't have a rearview mirror.

DOCTOR X320
Alright, will you be okay from here?

PATIENT X320
Yeah thanks doctor.

DOCTOR X320
Alright no problem.  We'll see you later okay.

PATIENT X320
Yep.

PATIENT LEAVES:  64:04.

Time is 1:35.

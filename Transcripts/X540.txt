DOCTOR X540
PATIENT.

PATIENT X540
Yes sir.  @@@.

DOCTOR X540
@@@.  Come on back here now.  How you doing?

PATIENT X540
I've seen better days in years past.

DOCTOR X540
Alright. 

PATIENT X540
All because I need to slow down.  Actually it's getting worse.  It's really getting worse.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  I noticed, go ahead and pop in there, I'll get you.

PATIENT X540
Thank you.

DOCTOR X540
I noticed that they you haven't seen Rheumatology yet, what's going on?

PATIENT X540
Um they doing uh I think a consult has been put in but I haven't gotten a date yet.

DOCTOR X540
Well you've seen them before correct?

PATIENT X540
Yes.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah, so you should be able to just make an appointment with them.

PATIENT X540
Oh really?

DOCTOR X540
Yeah.

PATIENT X540
Okay.  I didn't know I had to do that.

DOCTOR X540
Because, not since you've already seen them before.  You're an established patient in their clinic.

PATIENT X540
Oh I didn't know that.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT X540
I didn't know that that was supposed to be done.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah.  So I will um and I think we actually set it up for you last time.  What I'll do today is, you need to see them for the fibromyalgia.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Because it's obviously not controlled and I think we talked about the last time you know the limits, you know the limits as to why we can provide you.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Right so we need to actually have a, we need to have a plan of action kind of with everybody.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Alright including them so.  That's I mean you're telling me that you're actually getting a little bit worse.

PATIENT X540
A little bit.

DOCTOR X540
A lot worse and you were kind of bad off last time.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
So we need to get you all, kind of squared away and we need to get you to see them pretty quick.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay um how is everything else?

PATIENT X540
Well uh my throat's getting worse.  Of course I expect that and um my Achilles heel.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
Um I'm seeing a doctor at xxx and he said that there is a possibility that they're gonna shoot, have to shoot steroids in it.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
Well what can they do in the meantime?  It's killing me.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah, it's probably Achilles tendinitis, is that what it is?

PATIENT X540
I guess.

DOCTOR X540
Alright well let's take a look at it.  Uh who's the doctor you saw at xxx?

PATIENT X540
I don't even remember his name.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Um so you don't remember his last name.

PATIENT X540
I just know that it keeps swelling up.  They both seem to swelling up and going down, swelling up, going down, swelling up.  

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  

PATIENT X540
What do you got it?

DOCTOR X540
I'm actually seeing if I can bring up; see what we can bring up.

PATIENT X540
The notes.

DOCTOR X540
Yes sir.  @@@.

PATIENT X540
Oh and could you please give me something for the uh what is it the skin disorder thing?

DOCTOR X540
The eczema?

PATIENT X540
Yeah, sure.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  @@@.  When was it that you saw somebody?

PATIENT X540
This was the 9th I think it was.

DOCTOR X540
Okay, the General Medicine Clinic.

PATIENT X540
Yes.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah.  So what kind of clinic was it that you went to, was it just a general health clinic or?

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.  I put it as general health patient health clinic.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  So where do you see, where do you, you see your primary care is generally here is that correct?

PATIENT X540
No it's generally there.

DOCTOR X540
Okay, so what brought you here?  I mean you now; you've got a couple different primary care doctors.

PATIENT X540
Actually I was here because when I first came back.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
I was at xxx but then I came here because my mother was really, really ill and I needed someplace to go where I could get back quicker.

DOCTOR X540
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X540
And it was taking literally the entire day to go all the way out there and then try to get back.

DOCTOR X540
A little bit more convenient here.

PATIENT X540
Yeah more convenient here.

DOCTOR X540
Okay, alright.  So um I'll take a look, so yeah they did state that you had maybe some Achilles tendinitis that was going on.  They're @@@.  Now they recommended continuing the NSAID, the anti-inflammatories and ice it looks like, correct?

PATIENT X540
And it's not working at all.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Uh so they did mention a steroid injection I guess to you.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Uh if that is indeed necessary.

PATIENT X540
Rheumatology.

DOCTOR X540
Rheumatology can do that, Orthopedics can do it.  Uh do you use any insoles or any inserts in your shoes?

PATIENT X540
Yes.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  What kind of insoles or inserts do you use?

PATIENT X540
The ones I got from the store.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Do you have them in?

PATIENT X540
Uh I something in there, I think there's something in there.

DOCTOR X540
Let's take a look.

PATIENT X540
@@@ different insoles it.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah just that.  It doesn't look like it's a therapeutic one.

PATIENT X540
No I don't have any therapeutic ones.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Well another thing we can do and I'll ask you to take a seat so I can examine you up here, the one thing you can do is there are heel cups.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Called heel cups.

PATIENT X540
Well I don't know um.

DOCTOR X540
So this is your Achilles heel.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Your Achilles tendon.

PATIENT X540
I got it, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
So if you hyperextend your leg like that you can put stress on the Achilles.  If you put a little bit of uh what we call flexion in the foot with a heel cup, put on a little bit of a ramp.

PATIENT X540
Incline.

DOCTOR X540
Right you decrease the tension on the Achilles heel.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Okay so you're using, you're taking a lot of the anti-inflammatories and you are using ice okay but it may be that you just need to offload it on a daily basis.  So what I would do or what I recommend is Walgreen’s has them pretty cheap.  They're just the Mr. Scholl's gel insert.

PATIENT X540
I don't have the money for them.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Well we can see if we have them.

PATIENT X540
I don't have money for them, at all.  Waiting on that too.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Well I'll see if we have some here okay.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
But it might be something we should check into.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Uh but let me take a look at your feet.

PATIENT X540
Oh I'm tired of them swelling up.

DOCTOR X540
How's your asthma doing?

PATIENT X540
Oh my asthma hasn't been as bad.

DOCTOR X540
Okay good.

PATIENT X540
As it gets colder, more down than up.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
I can tell you now we're probably going to have an early winter.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.  You can tell that huh.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
That's pretty good.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Um alright, I don't want to hear that, that's kind of bad news if you ask me.

PATIENT X540
Yeah it is.  Oh do you need my socks off too?

DOCTOR X540
Yeah please that'd be good.  Blood pressure is really good.

PATIENT X540
Oh yes, oh yes.  Can you tell any difference from the other leg?

DOCTOR X540
Yeah let me look.

PATIENT X540
There's no difference.

DOCTOR X540
Let me have you @@@ for me.

PATIENT X540
Generally you can see the Achilles @@@ right now.  I'll tell you one thing @@@ the foot are, the feet and aches of my.

DOCTOR X540
Hop on up here.

PATIENT X540
Oh Lord.  And why is the bottom of my feet burning so much?

DOCTOR X540
Good question.  It could be because of your fibromyalgia.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Could be.  So is it tender when I press in here?

PATIENT X540
Not, this one is not as tender, it's tender but it's not as tender as this one.

DOCTOR X540
So when I do that does that bother you at all?

PATIENT X540
Yes.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
Mostly uh, but this one is worse.

DOCTOR X540
How about just when I flex like that, that bother you?

PATIENT X540
Well I mean up in here yeah.

DOCTOR X540
Okay and then.

PATIENT X540
Well you know the @@@.

DOCTOR X540
That does hurt.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Just sit up.  And when I press here does that bother you?

PATIENT X540
Hmm.

DOCTOR X540
Most people would, so that's a yes huh.

PATIENT X540
Ooh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Alright.  Can you lift your toe up towards my finger?  All the way up okay, relax it and all the way up and relax, good.  You been doing any exercises with it?

PATIENT X540
Hmm.  Ooh.

DOCTOR X540
Well this has been there @@@ a while huh?

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
Like I say it's like, uh this has been going on for a while but it's getting worse with the fibromyalgia getting worse and I don't know.

DOCTOR X540
Sure I mean it's the kind of deal where.

PATIENT X540
It's real, real difficult to walk.

DOCTOR X540
Hmm.  Let me take a listen to your heart and lungs.  Where's the eczema that you're talking about?  What's the.

PATIENT X540
Uh it's on my legs.  With the oil I got on it you can't really see it cause this is where I been scratching and I been getting the sores and what have you.

DOCTOR X540
Okay, do you have any on the other leg?

PATIENT X540
Uh well yeah but I mean it's not as prevalent as it is on this one.

DOCTOR X540
What are they using?

PATIENT X540
I don't know that they treated it.

DOCTOR X540
But you say you're putting some lotion on it right?

PATIENT X540
Oh yes, baby oil, you know petroleum jelly.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
But I mean it's like.

DOCTOR X540
Do you ever use any Eucerin cream or any of that stuff?

PATIENT X540
No I don't even know what that is.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Eucerin cream is just kind of a heavy duty, what we call emollient or moisturizer.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
We have some here that we use it's kind of like its called Hydroxy cream.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Uh it's a non-steroid cream but it is a pretty @@@ moisturizer that might help you out.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Do you have anywhere else?

PATIENT X540
Well it's like I'm getting like little patches you know just going up my leg I think.

DOCTOR X540
Is anything here like on your elbows or?

PATIENT X540
I haven't noticed.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  No patches anywhere else, mostly here on your legs correct?

PATIENT X540
Yeah, yeah, well mainly on my legs.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
My usually, what I been doing is the.

DOCTOR X540
Does the cream usually help when you um, the baby oil does it help for a little bit?

PATIENT X540
It helps for, yes it does, like long enough for me to get out of the shower.

DOCTOR X540
Yes.

PATIENT X540
And dry it off you know and then I don't have to keep scratching as much as when I, as soon as I get out the shower.

DOCTOR X540
Yes.

PATIENT X540
And start to oil and I try to let the oil seep in you know.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
While I'm taking a shower so that I won't cause I'm tired of scratching all night.

DOCTOR X540
Sure.  Let's do this, let's um after you shower okay.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
So really hot showers might be exacerbating it a little bit.

PATIENT X540
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X540
Can make it actually itch a little bit more.

PATIENT X540
I can't @@@ hot shower.

DOCTOR X540
I the good thing is.

PATIENT X540
@@@.

DOCTOR X540
You can't, that's just fine.

PATIENT X540
@@@.

DOCTOR X540
If you get the fibromyalgia under control, do the hot showers right dry off.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay and then after you're dry put on the moisturizing cream.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Don't do the oil in the shower.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Alright and we'll do the hydroxy cream alright.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Um so that's what we can do.  We'll see if we have the heel cups for the um Achilles tendon.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
With the fibromyalgia we'll write down for you to see the Rheumatology Clinic.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Probably within the next four weeks.

PATIENT X540
And one more thing.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.

PATIENT X540
If you really can't see all that much, I don't know if you can or can't but the skin peeling off my feet is so bad to the point, I mean if I didn't have oil on it you would see literally a lot of that.

DOCTOR X540
@@@.

PATIENT X540
But uh it's.

DOCTOR X540
Like is it itching in here too?

PATIENT X540
It itches on the bottom and on the sides yeah.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
But um.

DOCTOR X540
How about in between your toes?

PATIENT X540
Always.

DOCTOR X540
In between your toes always?

PATIENT X540
Always.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Do you ever use any, I mean do you ever use any anti-fungals in between your toes?

PATIENT X540
When I can buy some yes.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
But I can't afford any now.

DOCTOR X540
I'll get you a topical anti-fungal to rub on your feet.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Cause if you're getting a lot of scaling and itching.

PATIENT X540
And what I'm saying is.

DOCTOR X540
Cause we tend to see that here.

PATIENT X540
Yeah it's to the point now if I didn't have oil on it, it's to the point now when I'm pulling the skin off it's starting to bleed.

DOCTOR X540
Okay well don't do the oil on your feet.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Use this cream I'm gonna give you.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Okay and I'd almost recommend if you use it at night okay before you go to bed and in the morning when you wake up.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Before you put your shoes on during the day it should help.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
It's a @@@ cream.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
But it's a topical anti-fungal.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
If at night you don't want it getting on your sheets you can put some socks on.

PATIENT X540
I sleep with socks anyway.

DOCTOR X540
Great then that will help.

PATIENT X540
I don't know I hate walking barefooted.

DOCTOR X540
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X540
I just can't do it.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
Is that weird.  I don't like bare wood on my feet.

DOCTOR X540
That's fine.  I hate going to be with @@@ on my feet @@@.

PATIENT X540
Okay.  

DOCTOR X540
@@@ for your feet.  You just use it on the.

PATIENT X540
Anti-fungal.

DOCTOR X540
Right.

PATIENT X540
And some kind of cream for the rest of my life.

DOCTOR X540
For the leg.

PATIENT X540
@@@.

DOCTOR X540
And then for the uh fibro we'll get the follow-up with Rheumatology, with the Rheumatology.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
In four weeks okay.  Now if they say you go out there and they'll set the appointment up with them alright.

PATIENT X540
So what I'm talking about is they said they couldn't.

DOCTOR X540
Why not?

PATIENT X540
I don't know.  They said anything that's more than a month in advance I think, a week or a month in advance, they can't set it up.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah but Rheumatology, if I say Rheumatology in four weeks they should be able to send you over there.  Cause your last appointment with them was you know November 1.

PATIENT X540
It was cold outside I think wasn't it?  Rheumatology?

DOCTOR X540
Yeah let's see.

PATIENT X540
I think that was like back in February or March or something like that.

DOCTOR X540
There was a Rheumatology Note in October.

PATIENT X540
Like I said it was cold.

DOCTOR X540
Alright yeah and they wanted to see you back in a couple of months.

PATIENT X540
What do you give for @@@ pain in the knee?  That's what gets me and I'm like I'm stuck in this @@@.  I mean don't get me wrong, the Vicodins they're working but uh I think what it is is I told her that even at the point where they says well you might need to be on the Norco Vicodin because it doesn't have as much Tylenol in it because Tylenol does nothing for me, never has.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
And believe it or not that's the only little relief that I've been getting.  I'm ready for that.

DOCTOR X540
Alright cause the Rheumatology appointment you can make okay.

PATIENT X540
Yes.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.  The note, the clinic with me I'll see you in three months.  Now you have to call and make an appointment alright.

PATIENT X540
Okay I have to call in.

DOCTOR X540
Yes.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
But they should be able to make the Rheumatology appointment at the front.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Um let's see.  Uh what were the two other issues that you were talking about?

PATIENT X540
Um what the feet?

DOCTOR X540
Feet and then there was oh the um Achilles.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
So we need the heel cups okay and I think that was it.

PATIENT X540
And would you want to look at my throat?  Ever since I got my tonsils out I always have trouble with my throat when the weather changes.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
I don't know why.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
But it's slow going.

DOCTOR X540
Let me put these orders in real quick.

PATIENT X540
And you're only here once a month or once every two months?

DOCTOR X540
No I'm here every Monday.

PATIENT X540
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X540
But you may have tried to make an appointment when I was on vacation a couple weeks.

PATIENT X540
Oh okay.  I was like ain't he there, he need to be here more often.

DOCTOR X540
Did uh um okay.  

PATIENT X540
So what I'm, I mean I just keep suffering until I see Rheumatology?

DOCTOR X540
Oh we're not going to have you suffering.

PATIENT X540
Trust me I am, right now my back feel like uh.

DOCTOR X540
It's tough.

PATIENT X540
It's like somebody in a bull pit and I got to walk over there.

DOCTOR X540
Well let's do this I mean let's have you; we can see if we can get you in as soon as possible, hopefully in the next couple weeks.  It maybe the Achilles tendinitis is really kind of helping set off the fibromyalgia and maybe getting that controlled actually helps calm things down.

PATIENT X540
Okay.  I want to figure that one out.  So even when I'm not walking on it there's pain.

DOCTOR X540
Maybe you need to go up to um the Prosthetics.

PATIENT X540
Where is that?

DOCTOR X540
Um I think it's up on the fourth floor here.

PATIENT X540
xxx or Devane?

DOCTOR X540
xxx xxx.

PATIENT X540
Okay.  I @@@ pain.

DOCTOR X540
I know, you felt the same thing last time.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.  And the only difference is its gotten worse and I wish people were better; I can be the stupidest person in the world.

DOCTOR X540
What's that?

PATIENT X540
Why don't you act like you're in pain?

DOCTOR X540
Well I think you're pretty much tolerating your pain.

PATIENT X540
I mean how do you act when you're in pain @@@.  Now I don't think that the kiddie pill has a lot to do with me being in pain most of the time.

DOCTOR X540
Could be yeah I mean that's tough to tell I mean you're also a big guy right.

PATIENT X540
That's what people keep telling me.  I don't feel big.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah I mean you carry, you carry, I mean you're.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
You're a heavier guy, you’re a big guy um so the fibromyalgia is putting a little bit of pressure, keeping on your knees.  If you watch some of your weight, maybe if you could come down a few pounds.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
Alright we'll keep going.  That would take a little bit of pressure off your uh.

PATIENT X540
I weigh what 236, they said I'm down @@@ so I ain't doing too bad.

DOCTOR X540
Okay good.  So I put in the order for the cream right for the feet.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Alright and then the uh topical cream so I put in the order for the heel cups and then we got to see Rheumatology okay.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
And they'll set this up front.

PATIENT X540
And what about my throat?  @@@.

DOCTOR X540
What are you doing for the back of your throat?

PATIENT X540
I'm just gargling with salt water.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  Alright that's probably going to make your blood pressure go up.  Is the salt water @@@ help?

PATIENT X540
Uh well it's keeping it from uh.

DOCTOR X540
When did you have your, how long ago did you have your tonsils out?

PATIENT X540
xxx xxx 1980 maybe, 83 or 84 one of those.

DOCTOR X540
Do you have any drip in your nose?

PATIENT X540
Huh?

DOCTOR X540
Say ah.

PATIENT X540
Ah.

DOCTOR X540
And can you yawn for me with your mouth open, yeah that's good.  Alright.  Do you have any dripping from the back of your nose; do you get a stuffy nose?  Do you have seasonal allergies?

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay um when in the summertime.

PATIENT X540
I've already @@@ stuff.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
The what?

DOCTOR X540
Do you use anything for it?  Do you use um.

PATIENT X540
Nasal sprays yes.

DOCTOR X540
You use nasal sprays?

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Does that help?

PATIENT X540
Temporarily.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.

PATIENT X540
But um it’s like I said, I been going through this for years now.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah and it's not like, like you had your tonsils out.

PATIENT X540
Ever since I got my tonsils out I been going through this.

DOCTOR X540
Okay, alright.  So yeah, you probably can't see your tonsils, I don't see any infection.  You may have a little bit of irritation in the back of your throat.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Do you use the nasal sprays every day?

PATIENT X540
No.

DOCTOR X540
No.

PATIENT X540
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X540
Um what kind of nasal spray is it?

PATIENT X540
Uh, @@@ they gave it to me here.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
Uh it's in a long bottle @@@.  It's got a green safety cap on it to keep you from spraying it.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
I don't remember the name of it.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah.

PATIENT X540
My memory ain't quite as good as it used to be.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah maybe they got the steroids, yeah postnasal drip.

PATIENT X540
Well when I wake up in the morning doc, it's like uh what is the thing that hangs at the back of your throat?

DOCTOR X540
Yeah the uvula.

PATIENT X540
It's swollen.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
And I mean it's swollen to the point to where I have to keep swallowing just to get it to come down.  I don't know why that is or what can be done about it.

DOCTOR X540
Well we can try some of the nasal spray alright to see if it keeps some of this junk from going down in the back and irritating your throat.  Usually sore throats that are worse in the morning, alright with yours it sounds like it is, it's usually due to drip from the back of the nose from seasonal allergies and stuff.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
But supposedly I don't have any allergies, but they gave me an allergy pill so I got some kind of allergies.

DOCTOR X540
Do you get a stuffy nose?

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
Okay, okay.  Um and you said you do get junk in the back of your throat right?

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  So it could be not the seasonal allergies but allergies to dust mites, dander, stuff like that.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Which is very common.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Alright so maybe using this spray will help clear up your nasal passages and stop the dripping in the back.

PATIENT X540
What the one that I already have?

DOCTOR X540
That I'll give you right now, steroid nasal spray.

PATIENT X540
Okay.  What kind is it; it's not that uh Bausch & Lomb stuff is it?

DOCTOR X540
I don't think so.

PATIENT X540
Oh well you said a steroid nasal spray so maybe it's something that'll work but that Bausch & Lomb stuff sprays.

DOCTOR X540
It's supposed to be @@@.

PATIENT X540
Oh Flonase.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah there you go.

PATIENT X540
Flonase is great.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
They gave me Flonase.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah.

PATIENT X540
But they always want to substitute it with that other crap.

DOCTOR X540
Oh okay.  Well usually it just kind of depends on what we have on Formulary.

PATIENT X540
Yeah I mean well I won't do that Bausch & Lomb cause it burns my nose.  Feel like I'm spraying fire in my nose.

DOCTOR X540
Alright I mean I'm not sure.

PATIENT X540
I'm hoping its Flonase.  Flonase is great.  Isn't that what they're giving me already?

DOCTOR X540
I didn't actually see it listed.

PATIENT X540
Oh.

DOCTOR X540
The Flonase is fluticasone.

PATIENT X540
That works.

DOCTOR X540
It doesn't look like that's what we have on the Formulary, let's see.  We can ask for it, yeah we just have to put it down. I'm not sure if it's the Bausch & Lomb.

PATIENT X540
Alright, okay.  If it is they can keep it.

DOCTOR X540
I can give you a prescription for it and you can see.

PATIENT X540
Okay.  A prescription to go where?

DOCTOR X540
You can pick it up at the um at the Pharmacy.  I'm gonna be right back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  107:3  DOCTOR IN: 117:05) 

DOCTOR X540
Alright.

PATIENT X540
Yeah doc.  So I'm not supposed to see you for three months right?

DOCTOR X540
Yeah do you want to see me earlier?

PATIENT X540
Yeah cause I'm just thinking it's going to be fall by then and I don't want them looking in the groin.  Oh @@@ hurting my back that's why I'm on the floor.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.  So when do you want to see me?

PATIENT X540
Um this is August how about like September, October?

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
I got a feeling that I'm gonna get the run around again with this Rheumatology like I did the last time.  You remember I told you.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah.

PATIENT X540
I went to them and nothing got done, nothing.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
But you want me to go through them again so that's the only reason I'm doing it.  Purposefully, I don't see the purpose that they service.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.

PATIENT X540
So do you want me to do the nasal spray I got on a regular basis or the one that you're giving me?

DOCTOR X540
The one I'm giving you.  The one you have right now is bothering you correct?

PATIENT X540
Yeah.

DOCTOR X540
You don't like it.

PATIENT X540
No.

DOCTOR X540
It's the mometasone nasal spray I believe.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
Right we'll give you the one that we've got.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Alright and see if it makes you feel a little bit better.

PATIENT X540
Alright.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.  Um the heel cups.  I talked to DOCTOR about it.  DOCTOR would be hesitate to use them on older patients because sometimes you know you can shorten the Achilles tendon, some of the older people can actually become less short over time.  So only use it alright until the pain goes away alright.

PATIENT X540
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X540
And then we can start back up again.

PATIENT X540
Okay so.

DOCTOR X540
Okay.

PATIENT X540
When the pain go away take them out.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah, exactly.

PATIENT X540
@@@.

DOCTOR X540
What we want to do is just decrease the inflammation with the, give the Achilles some time to rest a while.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.

PATIENT X540
Okay.

DOCTOR X540
Alright.

PATIENT X540
No problem.

DOCTOR X540
So we're gonna deal with the problem.

PATIENT X540
Thank you.  Have a great rest of the summer.

DOCTOR X540
Alright you too.

PATIENT X540
It's shorter than it's gonna be.

DOCTOR X540
Yeah, see ya.

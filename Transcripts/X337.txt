DOCTOR X337
PATIENT? Hello.  How are you today?

PATIENT X337
Pretty good.

DOCTOR X337
Good to see you again.  Come on back.  Have a seat right there.  So I haven't seen you since the holidays, how have things been going?

PATIENT X337
Going down the toilet.

DOCTOR X337
Oh no, what's going on?

PATIENT X337
Uh I @@@ cardiac failure.  @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Minor @@@.

DOCTOR X337
How long has it been going on for you?

PATIENT X337
Been going a few months.

DOCTOR X337
A few months okay.  Next time that happens call me and we can get you in sooner okay.  I don't want you to wait that long if you feel.

PATIENT X337
You know I don't even know when I'm supposed to be seeing the cardiologist again.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah so you saw them in September it looks like, is that right?

PATIENT X337
Uh somewhere around there.

DOCTOR X337
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X337
Yeah.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  It looks like they did an echocardiogram.  @@@.

PATIENT X337
Not a heck of a lot.

DOCTOR X337
It says four months, so September, October, November, December, January, so you should have already had a follow-up with them.  We'll get you in to see them.  But first let's talk about this shortness of breath, what's going on?  It started four months, or then four months ago?

PATIENT X337
It's, I'm convinced that it's the blockage causing it.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  How far can you walk before you get short of breath?

PATIENT X337
Believe it or not walking it comes and goes.  I might get a little off, I don't know somewhere.  The pain but there's also shortness of breath.

DOCTOR X337
Like in your calves?

PATIENT X337
In here.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  Do you get like @@@ or.

PATIENT X337
It feels like it.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
But it's not it's.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
From the diabetes.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
But uh, trying to tie my shoes.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
That type of exertion and then in terms of not even exertion just sleeping.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
Getting into bed, curled on my side.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  Do you feel more short of breath when you're laying flat at night?  Do you wake up short of breath at all?

PATIENT X337
It happens.

DOCTOR X337
You have more shortness of breath.  Okay and laying flat is okay.

PATIENT X337
Well I don't usually.

DOCTOR X337
You usually don't okay.

PATIENT X337
I don't usually.

DOCTOR X337
Okay that's fine and did you park your car out there and walk in today or do you valet?

PATIENT X337
I parked and walked in, I didn't have any problems.

DOCTOR X337
Not this time.

PATIENT X337
If I can take my time I'm alright.

DOCTOR X337
Okay, it's when you're kind of walking a little bit faster?

PATIENT X337
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
If you can call it a little bit faster.

DOCTOR X337
Okay and then um how is that different from where you were when I last saw you?  Cause I just saw you @@@.  What were you able to do before that for a comparison?

PATIENT X337
I wasn't getting short of breath.  The only thing that was bothering me then was the pain.

DOCTOR X337
The pain.

PATIENT X337
In the legs.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  And they said that was a neuropathy is that what, okay yeah.

PATIENT X337
That's what they said.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Uh I wasn't that short of breath.

DOCTOR X337
That was never an issue.  It was the pain that made you stop.

PATIENT X337
No.

DOCTOR X337
And now it's like a little bit of both.

PATIENT X337
Right.

DOCTOR X337
Any chest pain with any of this?

PATIENT X337
Occasionally.

DOCTOR X337
Occasional.  What is it, is it kind of in the middle of your chest?  Does it go anywhere?  Where do you feel it?

PATIENT X337
It's kind of down in the ribs.

DOCTOR X337
It's down here?  On both sides?

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Like a tightness or what does it feel like?

PATIENT X337
It's uh, that's why I did the cardiac.  It's a, it's almost like the inside, the pain against like my ribs.

DOCTOR X337
Like a pressure?

PATIENT X337
Right.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
And it's there for a while and then it'll subside.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  And how long does it take for it to go away when you stop?

PATIENT X337
Maybe a few minutes.

DOCTOR X337
Few minutes okay.  So it does resolve after you stop and then it kind of goes away?

PATIENT X337
Yes.

DOCTOR X337
Okay and then if you're just sitting and not doing anything else, do you ever feel any symptoms or are you just only when you're moving and exerting yourself?

PATIENT X337
No, no, not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  Do you, have you noticed more fluid on your legs?

PATIENT X337
Today yeah.

DOCTOR X337
Today or over the last couple months?

PATIENT X337
It's been a couple months.

DOCTOR X337
Over the last couple months okay.  And you're still taking the Lasix twice a day the 40 and 40?  Okay.  Are you still having the same amount of urine output when you take the Lasix?

PATIENT X337
Uh just when it comes @@@ maybe it's not @@@ of it.  I think I've developed kind of a.

DOCTOR X337
Like a tolerance.

PATIENT X337
Tolerance.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah that happens sometimes.

PATIENT X337
That's what I was thinking.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X337
Only sometimes when I really need to go.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Other times it's like I never took it.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.  Are you eating more salt, salty food?

PATIENT X337
No, no, not really.

DOCTOR X337
Nothing like that.

PATIENT X337
I don't eat salt, I hate salty food.

DOCTOR X337
Okay, okay.  So you're kind of aware of eating more salt makes you swell up more okay.  Do you remember the last time we did like an echo of your heart that's imaging where they do an ultrasound of your heart?  The last one I found was in 2010, do you remember doing anything @@@?

PATIENT X337
Was that where they give @@@ the chest?

DOCTOR X337
No it's, it's more.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
It's just like a little machine, an ultrasound machine over your chest.  It's not like an x-ray.

PATIENT X337
I didn't.

DOCTOR X337
@@@ okay and then you had a CABG back in 2001, a open heart surgery and then you had stents placed in 2005 and nothing since then, okay.

PATIENT X337
Nothing since then.

DOCTOR X337
Okay, okay.  Oh in 2007.  You had something since then?

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
@@@ okay.

PATIENT X337
As far as that is because I lost my job and @@@.  I had that done before I lost my job.

DOCTOR X337
Okay and then when you saw DOCTOR in September, in his note now correct me if I'm wrong; he wanted you to cut down your Lasix in half.

PATIENT X337
Right.

DOCTOR X337
What were you taking before?

PATIENT X337
I was taking it twice a day.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
One pill twice a day.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
He wanted me to cut it down.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
I did that.

DOCTOR X337
Did not go well.

PATIENT X337
Did not go well.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
I added.

DOCTOR X337
You added it back okay and then after that you probably felt back to normal and then something happened.

PATIENT X337
Right.

DOCTOR X337
Where it got worse.

PATIENT X337
And now it's, I'm retaining the fluids.

DOCTOR X337
Retaining the fluids okay.  And you said how long exactly this has been going on for?

PATIENT X337
Four months, I don't know.

DOCTOR X337
Four months, okay so it's been a little while okay.  Um and then your blood pressure, how has that been doing?  Have you been checking it at all at home?

PATIENT X337
Blood pressure's fine.  It was okay today.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah it was really good today @@@.  Okay and then your diabetes, what's been going on?  Have you been checking your sugars?

PATIENT X337
It @@@.

DOCTOR X337
How we doing?

PATIENT X337
It bounces back and forth.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
@@@ healthier.

DOCTOR X337
What is that?

PATIENT X337
Uh I don't want anything to do with whatever @@@ is.  @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
I'm just.  I get really angry sometimes.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
You know I've been told they were going to send me a letter and I said you can call me on this date.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
And then I get here a half an hour early @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
And then you know, I didn't get called for an hour to an hour and a half later.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
I've got things I got to do and I'm working at night, I got to get some sleep.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
And that really ticks me off.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh did you explain that to her?

PATIENT X337
No I didn't because they tell me I was wrong last time.  She called one day and I didn't have any notice of an appointment.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
Oh just be here, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X337
Hmm.

PATIENT X337
No I didn't.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
And then she thinks I have the time and its like, look we talk about you, you need to change.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
What if I don't to?

DOCTOR X337
Well it's good to let us know if there is a complaint.

PATIENT X337
Well she was @@@ and she'd been constantly on this uh I think we need to change you to, the other type of @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  Was it long-acting?  What are you on now?  @@@.

PATIENT X337
I don't know, it's different.  I'm on the long-acting.

DOCTOR X337
You're on the long-acting.

PATIENT X337
Right.

DOCTOR X337
Hmm.  Are you taking it along with meals?

PATIENT X337
@@@  take it @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
@@@.  Sometimes I get it and other times I'd be eating like five and six times a day.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
That doesn't fit in a lifestyle at home.

DOCTOR X337
Right.  Okay.

PATIENT X337
So, I'm just a little irritated.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  @@@.  What have your blood sugars been running?

PATIENT X337
They'll go anywhere from 80 to uh about 160.

DOCTOR X337
Okay and when do you check your blood sugars?

PATIENT X337
Usually at night.

DOCTOR X337
Before you go to bed?

PATIENT X337
Before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X337
So that's like morning to you right?

PATIENT X337
That's morning.

DOCTOR X337
Okay so you're sleeping kind of all day and then you wake up, you check it and then you go to work.

PATIENT X337
Right.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  Do you ever check it after you eat a meal?

PATIENT X337
It's rare.

DOCTOR X337
It's rare.  But when you do where are we sitting on that?

PATIENT X337
Oh after a meal I'll shoot up to about in the 200s uh after dinner I'll check it, two hours.  At two hours it might be down to 180 which frequently is the case.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
I don't go back to normal after two hours.  In three hours I'm back.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
No but I can @@@ 140 range.

DOCTOR X337
Right, right.  

PATIENT X337
She doesn't like that @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Well um and what are we doing like your maintenance stuff, have you seen the eye doctors in the last year?

PATIENT X337
I'm okay.

DOCTOR X337
Right and then do you follow with Podiatry or no?  Do you ever have issues with your feet?

PATIENT X337
No, no.

DOCTOR X337
Ulcers or anything like that?

PATIENT X337
No

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  Just make sure you keep an eye out for that stuff just because you know, with neuropathy sometimes you don't feel it in your feet.

PATIENT X337
Oh the other thing I told the nurse when she checked my feet today.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
She mentioned about going barefoot, even in the house and I said that may not happen.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
But uh if I have a teensy little nick on the ball of my feet.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
It hurts, for quite a while.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
And our feet are so connected with.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
And I make sure @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
It took quite a while.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Maybe two or three weeks just for a little.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Teeny thing.

DOCTOR X337
And that's what's really concerning because of the diabetes and it's a slow healing process of wounds and a lot of people, unfortunately that have poorly controlled diabetes get a cut like that and that leads to developing like a bone infection and it gets worse and worse and.

PATIENT X337
I keep a close eye on that.

DOCTOR X337
It's very important and if things like you feel are getting all out of hand or a little out of your control then you've got someone to call and we'll get you in to see somebody.

PATIENT X337
What was my record and here's @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
I was told I'll call you and let you know the results and nobody called.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
What my A1c?

DOCTOR X337
The one in earlier April we checked?

PATIENT X337
Correct.

DOCTOR X337
Okay that one was 8.2.

PATIENT X337
Oh then that's pretty high.  @@@ was a lot better than those.

DOCTOR X337
And then the one in January was 8 and then you had 8.6 in August is when I saw you last.

PATIENT X337
I thought it was up in the teens.

DOCTOR X337
And then before that I think you were really up there and then before that, that's when you had a high number.

PATIENT X337
Okay.  But it was 8.2.  Oh the next thing, I got to say this before I forget.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Uh I had blood work today.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
I just had it on the 6th.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah um she didn't order all the tests that I wanted to see.

PATIENT X337
Oh so @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah I did, I did.  I just wanted other, like other tests as well.

PATIENT X337
That's fine.

DOCTOR X337
And then along with that is to check your A1c today.

PATIENT X337
I just.

DOCTOR X337
We want to have it here and it was 8.4.  8.4, this is really not that good.

PATIENT X337
So I'll just okay, I was curious whether.

DOCTOR X337
So I mean, you know the A1c is tested over three months so checking it @@@ you know.  But like said the more recent A1c we have the more we can then make changes to your medications.

PATIENT X337
Well months ago 6 was a lot.

DOCTOR X337
7 or below is my goal for you to have.  I think 6 or below um I was, with 6.5 or below you'd be in @@@ not diabetic but for a diabetic I want you below 7 and ideally around 6.5 but that would be our target.

PATIENT X337
I think the main problem is my @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah so.

PATIENT X337
But I can't move it.

DOCTOR X337
Well I know you work late so it's hard uh.  Yeah this is back in like 2010 you were like 12.7 and you were like 9.8 and then we kind of hung around the 8 region for a long time and that's why they sent you to @@@ so they could help you with that.  So tell me what, I know it's hard for you to gauge it so what is your diet usually consist of?  Do you know what's healthy to eat and what's not healthy to eat for diabetes?

PATIENT X337
Yeah.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
Stay away from carbs.

DOCTOR X337
@@@.

PATIENT X337
Stay away from carbs, starches, greases.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
And the sugar.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  Definitely.  You know okay so that's like one step and then I know you're kind of on the go it seems like.  Are you usually on the couch most of the time?

PATIENT X337
I've been more lately.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
But even then it's not always bad, well what I get it'll still be fast food but you know I'll have @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
Tuna.  @@@.  I cook a lot of chicken and it lasts for three or four days.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
What time is your biggest meal usually?

PATIENT X337
Right about now.

DOCTOR X337
Right about now okay and that's when you're like getting home from work?

PATIENT X337
Right.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
That's the thing I can't do without food so, @@@, mashed potatoes @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah that you make specifically yeah.  Do you remember the last time we did a stress test on your?

PATIENT X337
You haven't that I know of.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
But that's in the mail @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Right.

PATIENT X337
That's last time I had one.

DOCTOR X337
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT X337
I really don't remember when I got it.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
I've had more than one.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
And I only lasted like 30 seconds.

DOCTOR X337
Okay, but did you get the treadmill?  You got a treadmill?

PATIENT X337
Yeah.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
They started me on the main going a high speed.

DOCTOR X337
Right.  We don't, we don't have to do a treadmill, we could do like where we give you a medication and that's your stress test.  What I mean it stresses your heart enough to maybe push it and we monitor it.  People that can't get up on a treadmill we have other ways to do the stress test.

PATIENT X337
That's fine.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  It's a different kind test.

PATIENT X337
And I just can't do it because of the pain in my legs.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.  So I don't think your treadmill was here.  @@@.

PATIENT X337
@@@.  As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure it was before I had the last stent.

DOCTOR X337
Oh okay.

PATIENT X337
Cause I tried to talk the doctor out of doing it.  I said look @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Okay and then do you also, did you get your Lasix when you saw him.  You stopped the niacin and the Zetia.  Did you stop those two?

PATIENT X337
Yes.

DOCTOR X337
Okay but the Lasix you kind of went back to that.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
What were you having, you were just swelling more or short of breath or what?

PATIENT X337
Both.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
Mainly the shortness of breath because I could feel the fluid, feel the fluid in my lungs.

DOCTOR X337
Okay, yeah.  It's uncomfortable.

PATIENT X337
Is it a different type?  Right now I'm taking Lasix that I had.  @@@.  Might be generic.

DOCTOR X337
Oh the furosemide.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
Is there a difference?

DOCTOR X337
There isn't but we have room to go up on your list, you have a lot of room.  The max dose of Lasix is like 400 a day @@@.  So what we could do is I'll talk to DOCTOR and see what her plan is but I would probably want to get you an echo and see how much your cardiac function has changed.  I'd probably get an ultrasound of your heart.

PATIENT X337
Okay.

DOCTOR X337
Um I'd maybe do a stress test on you too.  I'll see what she has to say about it and I'd definitely increase your Lasix, at least for now because you've become symptomatic so we need to figure out what's going on okay.  But let me just take a @@@.  And then do you need refills on any medications do you know?

PATIENT X337
When I was getting weighed, uh let's see.  Carvedilol expires, I got five left until August.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Let's @@@.

PATIENT X337
Cause I've only got one refill left.

DOCTOR X337
Okay I'll refill that one too.

PATIENT X337
Furosemide I got three refills left.  Glipizide only one.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  What are you on for glipizide is it 10?

PATIENT X337
I take two tablets by mouth twice a day.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  And you're on the @@@.

PATIENT X337
10 mg.

DOCTOR X337
I'll refill that one.

PATIENT X337
Uh insulin two refills left before July.

DOCTOR X337
Okay I've got the metformin.

PATIENT X337
Metformin three refills left before July.

DOCTOR X337
@@@.  And you're still taking the rosuvastatin, that's for the cholesterol?

PATIENT X337
Correct.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  And that's going okay, no muscles aches or pains or anything?

PATIENT X337
No nothing.  How's the @@@ these days?  Did you get me a new statin?

DOCTOR X337
Oh yeah I did.  We'll go over that @@@.

PATIENT X337
And I do have one other unrelated question.

DOCTOR X337
Yes, @@@.  Let's see maybe we'll go 50 twice a day.  Do you have 20 mg tablets or are they 40's?

PATIENT X337
Uh.

DOCTOR X337
Do you take just one pill or do you take two pills in the morning.

PATIENT X337
It's one twice a day.

DOCTOR X337
Just one pill okay.

PATIENT X337
I take one.

DOCTOR X337
@@@.

PATIENT X337
So take two of them twice?

DOCTOR X337
Yeah I'll let you know a final decision, we'll write everything down.

PATIENT X337
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X337
Okay so, let's go through your labs.  The A1c we talked about before.  This is your white blood cell count.  Your hemoglobin here is 14.5 that's normal for a male your age.  Um your white blood cell count is 9 and that's a sign of infection.  Um your platelet count is 193 and that's also elevated.  This is your electrolyte count and also your kidney functions and your cholesterol levels.  So this is what I wanted.  I wanted to check your cholesterol and your liver enzymes since you were on @@@ a long time, so we check like your liver so I wanted to make sure nothing was going on with that.  Okay so your electrolytes, your potassium is actually a little bit low and that's probably from your Lasix so what we'll probably have to do is give you some potassium tablets okay.

PATIENT X337
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X337
Cause if that drops too low your heart can go into like arrhythmias it's just @@@.  So that's why we do that um, this is a test of your kidney function and it was 1.08 and that's kind of in your baseline so your kidney function is kind of in the low range.  Your urea nitrogen is your BUN.  It's another measurement of your kidneys um but that was consistent for you.  Let's see you were 6.7, nothing has changed and that's kind of what we look for in the test.

PATIENT X337
@@@ is high.

DOCTOR X337
It is high.  Minimally at high risk um and then the magnesium this is another one that is kidney function. So your potassium and your magnesium are two electrolytes that are very important to watch.  Your magnesium is also low.  So we'll probably have to start you on supplements and I may even want to give you some IV stuff here today before you go home and I know you're tired and you want to go home and sleep.

PATIENT X337
I want to eat.

DOCTOR X337
@@@.  And then these are your triglycerides so those are the fats.  So that's what you were taking niacin for @@@.  Yeah you were at @@@ on the niacin.  Do you know why she didn't want you on it?  No.

PATIENT X337
I don't know.

DOCTOR X337
Were you tolerating it okay?  You weren't getting real hot or night sweats.

PATIENT X337
@@@ rashes or itches.

DOCTOR X337
Well I would probably restart that for you, if that's okay with you.

PATIENT X337
It's okay with me.

DOCTOR X337
Those numbers, I think I don't like this number.  I definitely want you like closer to 200 and also @@@, let's just do that.  So I @@@.

PATIENT X337
It wasn't just the niacin, what was the Zetia for?

DOCTOR X337
So Zetia is also kind of a type of cholesterol um and your statin.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
Because I was controlled with triglycerides under the doctor before.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Uh and he specifically put me on those to get the triglycerides down.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.  So the only problem with Zetia is that like they haven't really proven that it does a lot, like it maybe minimally helps with your triglycerides.  It also causes a lot of GI upset.  So I would prefer we would start back on the niacin first and you know check this in like three months and see if it's helping.  If that's not helping then we can add back the Zetia but with the Prilosec I'd rather you just do the niacin if you tolerate that well if it controls it.  Okay.

PATIENT X337
I've never had any side effects on any of the medications.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah, that's good.  Your medicines.  Your cholesterol.  So there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.

PATIENT X337
The good is always low.

DOCTOR X337
Your good cholesterol is the HDL and the niacin also helps with that actually.  It'll help bring it up just a little bit but the way you get your HDL up is exercise.  Physical exercise which I know right now is kind of hard because of work going on but your LDL and exercise helps with that.  Great we want you below 70; you're at 58, that's excellent.  Your diabetic with heart disease and we want you below 70 for your bad cholesterol.  So the LDL is where we want it.  The HDL is a little bit low um, we'll work on kind of symptomatically relieving your issues so you can feel a little more but we mainly covered that.  Your @@@ are your liver function tests, all the liver functions, but these usually go back when you're on a statin and then they'll be normal.  

PATIENT X337
@@@ high?

DOCTOR X337
No that's low, 0.4 is low.  4 is high it looks like you've never had levels that high @@@.  Yeah you've been down @@@.  So @@@ go back on niacin.  Do you want to do a 90 day supply or do you want a 30 day supply?

PATIENT X337
@@@. Will that be sent to me?

DOCTOR X337
Yes sent in the mail.  Okay let me just uh examine you and then we'll come up with a game plan and I'll write everything down for you.  Where do you work security?

PATIENT X337
I work uh in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  That's @@@ right yeah.

PATIENT X337
Right.  @@@.  About.

DOCTOR X337
@@@.

PATIENT X337
About 18 miles I guess.

DOCTOR X337
Oh okay.  Do you work there too?

PATIENT X337
Yeah.  @@@ Nordby.

DOCTOR X337
Just look straight ahead for me I just want to check your eyes first.  Open up wide for me, say ah.

PATIENT X337
Ah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X337
@@@.  Okay.  Can I have you hold your breath for a minute?  Okay perfect.  Deep breath for me.  So are some days worse than others?  Is today probably a good day for you?  I don't hear much fluid in your lungs.

PATIENT X337
Oh no, @@@ good day.

DOCTOR X337
So with the exertion the shortness of breath you're getting.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah, yeah.  Is it days on days off kind of a thing @@@.

PATIENT X337
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  But you said you've noticed more fluid huh?

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
And that's the way you can.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
You know it's not down in my feet, it's always there.

DOCTOR X337
Here.  @@@ all right here.  You can tell that by pushing down and if it leaves an indent.  You usually don't have that.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
The swelling.

PATIENT X337
Yeah, that's what I've been having for about.

DOCTOR X337
For the last four months.  But before I'm saying you didn't have any fluid on there, okay.  @@@.  Check this side.

PATIENT X337
Since @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Why is this one red?  Is it because of the veins for your surgery, do you know?

PATIENT X337
Uh.

DOCTOR X337
When they do cardiac surgery sometimes they take a vein from your legs for the graft, do you remember?

PATIENT X337
I don't remember.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah a lot of people are like that.  Okay, uh just have a seat right there.  I'm going to talk to DOCTOR.  I'll be back in just a couple minutes okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  58:14  DOCTOR IN:  69:09)

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  So we've come up with a game plan.  Do you have that little med sheet they gave you when you came in, I have to write down on it, then you can keep that and I'll take this one okay.  So I'm just going to write on the back of this one if that's okay.  So we'll do the changes.  We're going to do your Lasix we're going to do 60 mg twice a day.  You can cut your pills in half; do you have a pill cutter?

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Oh okay that's fine too yeah so just cut them in half until you get the new ones.  The new ones will probably just be 20's and you'll take three.

PATIENT X337
What am I taking?

DOCTOR X337
You're taking 40 mg twice a day.

PATIENT X337
Okay.

DOCTOR X337
Now it's going to be 60.

PATIENT X337
So 1 1/2 okay.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah it goes to 1 1/2.  Um and then we're starting the niacin okay and then I'm starting you on some calcium @@@.  Your calcium and magnesium are low.  I'm not going to make an IV I know you want to go home and sleep but I want you to take so we're going to give you magnesium it's going to be 420 mg three times daily.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
For one week yeah and then you just take it twice a day.

PATIENT X337
Three times a day for a week.

DOCTOR X337
One week and then after that just take it twice a day and then potassium, that's potassium chloride and that's 20 mg and you'll take that twice daily.  So we're increasing your Lasix and @@@.

PATIENT X337
What's the difference, just out of curiosity?

DOCTOR X337
Sure.

PATIENT X337
This is @@@ isn't it?

DOCTOR X337
No.

PATIENT X337
It's not.

DOCTOR X337
Sodium is salt.

PATIENT X337
Oh.

DOCTOR X337
Right, potassium is something else yeah.

PATIENT X337
Okay.

DOCTOR X337
It's another electrolyte.  It's like inside of your cells, it's the thing it has the most of is potassium.

PATIENT X337
Okay.

DOCTOR X337
And it stabilizes your cardiac membranes if you have enough potassium.  It if doesn't then you can have like arrhythmias and that's probably not good for your heart @@@.

PATIENT X337
Yeah and when you were checking me I could feel, I could feel the heart.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
Doing weird stuff in their.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah, yeah.  So we'll keep an eye on that stuff.  We'll do the electrolytes and that might help.  If you continue to feel like palpitations and stuff like that then we can put you on a Holter monitor.  It hooks up to you and kind of watches your rhythm for a little while but we'll adjust @@@.  Um and I'm gonna schedule you to see Cardiology.  Cardiology appointment they'll schedule you when you're leaving just take the next available if you can.  We're gonna do an echo. That's an ultrasound of your heart and that'll tell us how much your blood is pumping, your ejection fraction I don't know if you've heard that before so you know.  If it's low.

PATIENT X337
I don't remember when I had it but the last time I had it it was not this cardiologist, the one before.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
Had me do it and @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Your ejection fraction was low.  It was 40% at that time.

PATIENT X337
Yeah.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah.

PATIENT X337
And he said he was a little concerned about it.

DOCTOR X337
Right so if it's, on this echo so if you're a lot worse then we would worry and would probably send you to do a stress test.  But I would do the chemical one for you so the treadmill wouldn't be an issue okay.  We want to see how you're heart's doing when it's under stress.

PATIENT X337
Okay.

DOCTOR X337
And if your echo looks find and I'll call you when I get the results.  It might take like a week to kind of get that back so uh if your echo looks fine then I wouldn't worry, then we'll just do @@@ and then we'll see how you do.

PATIENT X337
So when am I doing this echo?

DOCTOR X337
It's going to be scheduled.  When you check out they'll schedule you.

PATIENT X337
Okay.

DOCTOR X337
Uh and then I want you to come back for labs in one week.

PATIENT X337
Again?

DOCTOR X337
Yes.  I want to make sure your potassium and magnesium are coming back to normal.  I don't want to stress your heart any more than we have to, so it's really important.

PATIENT X337
Well I've got to get this today then.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah do you want to pick those up downstairs?

PATIENT X337
I can.

DOCTOR X337
I'd prefer you do.  I know you want to go home and sleep but, I'd prefer you just pick them up.  Especially because they're new, let me just sign this and get all this stuff ordered and then I want you to see, I know you don't like the plan B stuff kind of didn't work out and that's totally fine.  I want to actually see an endocrinologist.  They manage diabetes a lot better.

PATIENT X337
Than this.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah so, we'll set you up with one.

PATIENT X337
@@@.

DOCTOR X337
Let's just go down, your A1c has been 8 for like a while so we're not really making headway so.  Endocrinology means like the doctors look at the glands in your body and the pancreas is like a gland so they deal with it a lot so they're very good.  Okay, is this pretty clear?

PATIENT X337
Yeah.  Furosemide 1 1/2 twice a day.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
Start the niacin, start the, restart the niacin.

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X337
Magnesium, new one three times a day.

DOCTOR X337
You can restart it whenever you get it, it's not.

PATIENT X337
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X337
You know it's not urgent you start it today.

PATIENT X337
Magnesium, potassium start today or tonight.  Magnesium three times a day for a week then twice a day and potassium chloride twice a day, Cardiology appointment, echo appointment, labs in one week.  @@@.

DOCTOR X337
Okay wonderful.  Okay so I ordered those two for the windows so they should be there um and those other two I ordered the niacin, I ordered your echo.

PATIENT X337
And go to Cardiology, do the echo and endocrinologist but they, I just need to go get the echo right?

DOCTOR X337
Uh-huh.  But they'll have to schedule you.  I don't know if you can just go over or if they schedule you and if things get worse I want you to call and if they tell you come in for an HC visit I want you to do that.  That means we're going to take @@@.  Even if you don't see me you need to be seen by somebody.  I don't want you to go through or suffer for three months before somebody sees you, do you know what I mean?  Usually they'll be able to get you in with me but if they don't.

PATIENT X337
Don't close out.

DOCTOR X337
Don't close out.

PATIENT X337
Okay.  I got another question.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
Which month?

DOCTOR X337
Hmm.  Okay and then when are you due to see the eye people again?  September okay, next September.  

PATIENT X337
Well I'm still confused if the furosemide, at least to me doesn't seem like its working then why am I depleting my potassium and magnesium?

DOCTOR X337
Because it's still making you urinate and potassium and Lasix actually wastes potassium.  So even if you're on a low dose sometimes people can be wasting potassium.  Some people are sensitive to it differently um because the higher you go on a dosage the more potassium you're gonna lose so that's why it's important.  So @@@ on Lasix you're going to lose potassium.  Some people their bodies adjust to it and they kind of you know just absorb more potassium and your body's kind of like leaks the stuff but when you're on a higher dose of it it can't keep up and so you're better just to take oral.  It's not uncommon.

PATIENT X337
No @@@.  What fruits might include?

DOCTOR X337
Bananas, very high in potassium.

PATIENT X337
Oh good I like bananas.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah eat a banana every morning if you can or every night whenever you're going to work.  Okay, what were the other questions?

PATIENT X337
Oh yeah I see on TV and I also see you have the documentation out here in the Waiting Room.

DOCTOR X337
Yes.

PATIENT X337
Should I get that?

DOCTOR X337
The shingles.  So you are 62, so we recommend vaccination usually around you know after 60.  Um have you had the chicken pox as a child?  You have okay.  So you know what shingles is? 

PATIENT X337
I guess it's some sort of a neuro.

DOCTOR X337
Yeah @@@.  Exactly it's a herpes @@@ so.  Chicken pox is a herpes virus.  You get chicken pox and you break out everywhere and it goes away but it actually stays in your body, it's dormant and then one day when you're older and your immune system's down and especially if you're a diabetic sometimes.

PATIENT X337
That's what I.

DOCTOR X337
@@@ it can flare, it can flare-up and then when it flares up it kind of is like, it flares up like in a distribution of one side of your body.

PATIENT X337
I've seen it.

DOCTOR X337
And it's like pretty, it's pretty painful.  

PATIENT X337
Yeah.

DOCTOR X337
Some people sometimes can have residual neuropathy so I mean if you're not adverse to getting it we'll do it today.

PATIENT X337
That fine.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.

PATIENT X337
That's what I wanted to know.

DOCTOR X337
Sure, sure.

PATIENT X337
She recommended it.

DOCTOR X337
It's a great product; it's a great product yeah.

PATIENT X337
I don't need any more pain.

DOCTOR X337
Okay, let's walk you out.  Okay so labs in a week okay.

PATIENT X337
Okay.

DOCTOR X337
I think we have everything all set.  I want you to come back to see me in a little shorter interval this time is that okay?

PATIENT X337
Sure.

DOCTOR X337
Okay.  So we'll see you in two months.  That's to check your cardiac enzymes.

PATIENT X337
Are you getting close to leaving?

DOCTOR X337
No I'm just starting so you'll see me in two months.

PATIENT X337

DOCTOR X337

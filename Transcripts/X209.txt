PATIENT X209
Everybody bakes for me and you don't want to insult anybody so you eat it all you know.

SECOND PERSON X209
You may not be able to eat it but they still want to bake it for you.

DOCTOR X209
You'll just have to tell them that you can't eat um baked goods.

PATIENT X209
Oh I don't want to embarrass them.

DOCTOR X209
Make them feel bad.

PATIENT X209

SECOND PERSON X209

DOCTOR X209
Okay.  Let me see here, we gave the form for the last time.

SECOND PERSON X209

SECOND PERSON X209

DOCTOR X209

SECOND PERSON X209
But it's still like its real almost irritated or something, you know real red, you know like cherry red.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X209
So I don't, but we haven't seen any of the um, like it was getting like a blister, like a blood blister, we don't get anything like that there.

DOCTOR X209
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X209
But it is getting that very red, cherry red spotting all over the membrane part.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah okay.

SECOND PERSON X209
And uh, he wanted me to tell you this so um.

PATIENT X209
Yeah.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X209
So he has to be abstaining so this is not good for us at this age.
PATIENT X209
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
@@@.

PATIENT X209
I told her if I was still a young guy.

SECOND PERSON X209
There's nothing happening.

PATIENT X209
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
It just wouldn't happen.

PATIENT X209
We got bigger problems.

DOCTOR X209
Alright what are we doing today?

SECOND PERSON X209
He's not @@@ real good.

DOCTOR X209
I don't @@@ and why did you have some problems, that's a good thing.

SECOND PERSON X209
Well yeah but it's @@@.

PATIENT X209
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X209
Sure, sure.  You got it, alright so we need to take a look.  Let me grab some gloves, just have a seat here.  Everything else okay?

SECOND PERSON X209
Uh yes but other than some of the prescriptions.

DOCTOR X209
Need refills?

PATIENT X209
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
Uh well I went to see him @@@ that was the last one and then she never gave the one for the simvastatin and um I'm having a problem on the telephone for this hydrochlorothiazide for here.  Every time we call they say that it's on hold.  Why I don't know yeah and why I don't know because we're supposed to be able to get three refills and I'm down to two weeks is all I got left and then I'm out.

PATIENT X209
That @@@.

DOCTOR X209
I don't know why they put it on hold.

SECOND PERSON X209
But I, you know it's hard cause you got to clear it or something and I don't understand that because you're supposed to be able to get three more refills on it.  And that's one of his blood pressure medications so.  

DOCTOR X209
I don't know why this is on hold.  And he's taking a half tablet currently?

SECOND PERSON X209
Yep.  25 mg 1/2 tablet yeah.

DOCTOR X209
Well, I'll just refill instead of renewing.  90 days supply right?

SECOND PERSON X209
Yes.

DOCTOR X209
You want me to mail it or do you want to pick it up today?

SECOND PERSON X209
Uh why don't we pick it up today because like I said there's only two weeks left and I don't want to have no problems so.

DOCTOR X209
Alright.

SECOND PERSON X209
@@@.

DOCTOR X209
@@@ again.

SECOND PERSON X209
Yeah, if there's no rush @@@.

PATIENT X209
One other thing I wanted to ask you before we leave too is about the fact it feels like there's something in there sometimes but it waters a lot but something, it doesn't always feel like there's sometimes in there when it does but sometimes.

SECOND PERSON X209
Well yeah explain to him that it's mostly when you're watching.

PATIENT X209
Actually it might be strain, I don't know.

SECOND PERSON X209
Okay.

PATIENT X209
But it feels like there's something in here sometimes, I thought I might be redeveloping a sty because I had a sty before but that doesn't.

DOCTOR X209
Is it grainy and scratchy?

PATIENT X209
It's always running.  Not always but it's @@@ always running.

SECOND PERSON X209
His eye is always tearing.

DOCTOR X209
This irritation you're having does it feel like there's a piece of sand in there or something?

PATIENT X209
Yeah, yeah it feels like I had a sty before and I know what it feels like and it's like there's something rubbing in that spot.

SECOND PERSON X209
Does it feel like up under the eyelid or what?

PATIENT X209
It feels like it's on the eye itself but I don't know.

DOCTOR X209
Okay then.

PATIENT X209
You know I don't think I've got a sty cause you know I've had it before I know what it looks like but it just feels like once in a while like there's something there.  It's always in the same spot and most of the time, it's probably eye strain but sometimes it runs and runs and runs and it just looks like I'm crying like hell it runs so bad.

DOCTOR X209
Hmm.  There's nothing I can see today.  You can get little viral infections in the eye so you can even get a little bit of exudate, a little crustiness there.

SECOND PERSON X209
No I don't notice anything like that.

PATIENT X209
No, like I said this has been doing this for what at least a year now off and on.

SECOND PERSON X209
If he gets in the wind right away @@@.

PATIENT X209
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
He'll actually just cry, cry, cry.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah @@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
He does this um sort of like bright sunlight he starts getting the waters right away um.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah I don't know, um it may you could get some drops, some rehydrating drops.  What happens when you watch TV and like the wind blowing, it's essentially drying up so your eye may be over-reacting to it being dry so it's dumping the tears out to just rehydrate your eye.

PATIENT X209
Yeah.

DOCTOR X209
You could try, you know getting a little thing of saline, so that has medication in it and every time you're going to sit down and watch TV just put some drops in and see if that makes any different.  I'm just shooting in the dark here.

SECOND PERSON X209
Yeah.

PATIENT X209
It's the @@@ thing you know cause just now, I was just sitting out there now, ain't watching any TV or anything but all of a sudden it just started running.

SECOND PERSON X209
The lights.

PATIENT X209
Yeah maybe it's the lights.

DOCTOR X209
Hmm.  If it gets any worse or there's a problem we can have Ophthalmology take a look but he's probably not going to see anything, you know just based on what I can see here at this point.

PATIENT X209
It's probably that the eye strain and also the lights are hurting my eyes or something.

DOCTOR X209
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON X209
He's got drops at home don't you?

PATIENT X209
@@@.
SECOND PERSON X209
@@@ very touchy eyes.

DOCTOR X209
Still the same and actually it's redder than the last time I saw it.  We still with the exudate there.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON X209
Well actually that looks like a blister is there.  The skin is coming off there.

DOCTOR X209
@@@.  

PATIENT X209
No uh uh.

DOCTOR X209
Hmm.  Okay so it feels a lot better than it did the last time.  Now you're not having a problem pushing the foreskin back.

SECOND PERSON X209
Yeah but it still don't look good.

PATIENT X209
Last time I was really having a lot of trouble @@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
But it's in that mucous-like.

DOCTOR X209
Right, right.

SECOND PERSON X209
Secretion like now and he's getting it in the underwear so um.

DOCTOR X209
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X209
And he didn't notice that before so now he's noticing that so.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X209
Otherwise he ain't touching @@@.

DOCTOR X209
@@@.  And you're washing every day?

PATIENT X209
Yeah.

DOCTOR X209
Hmm.  Alright well you should be on the first round of @@@. 

SECOND PERSON X209
He did that one and do it again.

DOCTOR X209
I'm going to go talk to my boss to see if he has any suggestions.  I'd hate to have to send you to a urologist.  I think we can handle it here.  Let me step out, I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X209
Uh-huh.

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:21  DOCTOR IN:  51:55)

DOCTOR X209
Alright.  You got to sign something.

SECOND PERSON X209
Oh good.  And by the way I took him off of @@@.  He took that for about a week @@@.

DOCTOR X209
Oh was he getting @@@.  He took the one dose @@@ that's fine.

SECOND PERSON X209
But then I put him back on it.

PATIENT X209
After a period of time yeah.

DOCTOR X209
Sounds good.

PATIENT X209
After a week and a half.

DOCTOR X209
We got two doctors here.

SECOND PERSON X209
Yeah.

PATIENT X209
Her whole family are doctors.

DOCTOR X209
I'm going to call her for a consult.

PATIENT X209
Her whole family is doctors.

SECOND PERSON X209
@@@.

PATIENT X209
Every one of them the prescribe for each other.

DOCTOR X209
@@@.

PATIENT X209
The little drug ring they have.

DOCTOR X209
Alright so I talked to DOCTOR and he wants to do another treatment with the tablets, the anti-fungal.  But also wants you to go see the urologist and he makes a good point, one is if you don't respond to this next dose then there may be something we need to change or something more serious to investigate one being the urologist might recommend that you need a circumcision.   Which could eliminate it.

PATIENT X209
Nothing like being @@@.

DOCTOR X209
Um and then uh.

SECOND PERSON X209
I'm still fighting my @@@.

PATIENT X209
Whatever it is, it's strong whatever it is.

DOCTOR X209
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON X209
Cause she put me on three weeks at a time.  I have two doses at three weeks at a time and um I'm not taking them cause I don't need it for that reason and uh she's also got me using outside powder that you use for athlete's feet.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X209
And she's also got me using a more extensive powder which doesn't work and I'm still fighting it and this has been since October and I started two times a day and stuff and I still got it.  It's not as bad but I still got it and I see her tomorrow for this.  She was giving me 200 mg a day of the same pill, that's two pills @@@.

DOCTOR X209
@@@ fluconazole.

SECOND PERSON X209
Yeah she was giving me that, two pills which is 100 mg, so 200 mg a day for three weeks and then there was a five week period between there and then she gave me another dose for three weeks and like I said I'm still fighting it so.  Whatever it is is very in there.  It doesn't want to die.

PATIENT X209
Yeah it's just, just a lot better and then all of a sudden boom, like back @@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
Uh-huh.  And I have to talk to her about mine tomorrow.  It's a lot better but it's still not gone.  It's just hanging in there.  And you know we're benign because it's something, it's not, I mean we don't think it's anything that you know @@@ that area.  

DOCTOR X209
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X209
I mean I don't know, not being a doctor, I don't know if there's another one that's stronger than that yeast infection, whatever you call it, whatever it is.  I don't know if there's a higher one than that or whatever, but it's just a pretty strong one.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah, it should be okay um.  So we'll give you that one tablet again okay.  Now you want to pick it up at the window?

SECOND PERSON X209
Yeah.  As long as we're going to the window we might as well get it now.

DOCTOR X209
Sure.

PATIENT X209

DOCTOR X209
And then let's see here, we need to call them.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah I know.

SECOND PERSON X209
@@@.  I like this one; she looks like she's really happy on that one.

PATIENT X209
When you're young you think the little ones are kind of cute but when you get to be my age then you realize just how precious they are.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah uh, it makes the bad days good to go home and pick her up.  She comes over running and gives daddy a big hug.

PATIENT X209
Well yeah she knows.

SECOND PERSON X209

SECOND PERSON X209
See they forgot you on the first one; see I told you that was.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah you're right, we got it down.  Alright so

SECOND PERSON X209
@@@.

DOCTOR X209
I put in the consult, I put in the medications.  Um she did say the thing we want to investigate since it didn't respond is whether or not it's going to be better to just do foreskin separation or whether or not there's anything more serious that they want to investigate.  The reason why I'm having them see you is because they see this more often and so they'll say you know what this is suspicious for something more concerning or whether or not they want to biopsy or whether they want to say um let's do a further work-up.

SECOND PERSON X209
Well we can't see @@@ cause he's doing @@@ with the sponge.

DOCTOR X209
Right.

SECOND PERSON X209
Until he brings it in.

DOCTOR X209
Right.  I don't think.

SECOND PERSON X209
And the foreskin will turn him off because he does not like pain.

DOCTOR X209
Well I don't blame him.

SECOND PERSON X209
@@@.

PATIENT X209
I'm working for 67.

DOCTOR X209
I don't blame you.  @@@ um and that's why she probably wants you to see them.  It's just an issue that's not been getting any better.

SECOND PERSON X209
Well we think it's just something else besides the foreskin.

PATIENT X209
Cause I've never had no problem with it.

SECOND PERSON X209
He's never had no problems with anything until now.

DOCTOR X209
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X209
You know you tell me it's an old age thing, I just don't think so.

PATIENT X209
@@@.

DOCTOR X209
I believe everything.

SECOND PERSON X209
Oh really.

DOCTOR X209
If you were a diabetic then I would be, I would say just to leave because you're closer @@@ but you're not diabetic.

SECOND PERSON X209
No.  Not that we can see.

DOCTOR X209
Alright we'll try again and I think if they have anything to offer it'd be worth hearing.

SECOND PERSON X209
Um when do we see you again?

DOCTOR X209
Oh let's see you can come back and see me in six months unless you have something else to.

SECOND PERSON X209
Well we can't, yeah we're going to have to talk to you about his knee.  We can't @@@ that until this.

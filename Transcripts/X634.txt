DOCTOR X634
PATIENT.

PATIENT X634 
Over here.

DOCTOR X634
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X634
That's me.

DOCTOR X634
Alright nice to see you.

PATIENT X634
Good to see you too.

DOCTOR X634
Right in here.

PATIENT X634
Okay.

DOCTOR X634
Alright sir.  What brings you in here today?  Just a regular follow-up?

PATIENT X634
Just a regular call plus I need, I need to two appointments, two new appointments.  I need an appointment to hearing, to get my ears checked on the 4th floor at the hearing station and plus I need a dermatologist appointment.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  What's your dermatologist appointment for?

PATIENT X634
I got an itch that's going on a month and a half and I can't seem to get rid of it, it just gets worse.

DOCTOR X634
Okay where have you noticed it?

PATIENT X634
Oh it's on the heel on both sides, sometimes all around the rash, on the shoulder, on this arm here and this shoulder now.

DOCTOR X634
Okay what have you tried for it?

PATIENT X634
And right down here.

DOCTOR X634
What have you tried for it?

PATIENT X634
Huh?

DOCTOR X634
What have you tried for it?

PATIENT X634
I got all kinds of stuff.

DOCTOR X634
Creams and stuff.

PATIENT X634
It's stuff.  They gave me, I got a liquid that I put on it and it helps and I also bought some other itch.  I think I need an allergy, a good allergy pill or something inside.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X634
It comes on me worse when I eat, after I eat.

DOCTOR X634
After you eat. 

PATIENT X634
It seem to attack other than that sometime I don't even notice I have an itch.

DOCTOR X634
Alright do you have uh, do you notice any rashes or anything?

PATIENT X634
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR X634
Does this spot really itch or not?

PATIENT X634
It may be nerves cause sometimes I've been scratching on it a bit.

DOCTOR X634
So a couple uh a few months ago you came in with some swelling in your legs, how has that been doing?

PATIENT X634
It's doing pretty good.  I also had to come in because of the itching.  Twice I was given a different itch medicine to stop the itch.  It all helped, but there's nothing permanent.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
What are suggesting or think it is?

DOCTOR X634
Uh that's a good question um.  It affects your life sometimes.

PATIENT X634
And see I went to see a dermatologist.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah.

PATIENT X634
I figured from what I explained to him, he was getting an idea as to what is happening.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah they have a little more experience with that.  We'll talk with DOCTOR and see if he has any information, if he has any ideas.  Um.

PATIENT X634
Would I be able to talk to DOCTOR before I leave here?

DOCTOR X634
Yeah I'll talk to him.

PATIENT X634
Oh good.

DOCTOR X634
At least um and then I'll tell him what's been going on so.

PATIENT X634
I have trouble sleeping.  I have to almost put the stuff all over my body in order to be able to get to sleep.

DOCTOR X634
And uh have you tried anything other than creams?  Did they ever give you a pill for the itching?  Or has it always been creams.

PATIENT X634
Say what?

DOCTOR X634
Have they ever given you a pill for the itching or has it always been creams?

PATIENT X634
No nothing to go inside, just something for the outside, an ointment and liquid kind of stuff.  

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
And an itch cream called male something and I got two bottles of that and then I got an ointment, its hydro something that supposed to keep you from.

DOCTOR X634
Hydrocortisone?

PATIENT X634
Yes.

DOCTOR X634
Did that help some?

PATIENT X634
I don't know I haven't used much of it yet.

DOCTOR X634
Oh okay.  When did you get that?

PATIENT X634
I got that a week and a half ago I think when I was here.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  That was the uh.

PATIENT X634
I picked it up and the doctor who prescribed it said it might help it.

DOCTOR X634
The oncologist?  DOCTOR?

PATIENT X634
I can't say for sure.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  Um but you haven't used the cortisone cream much, the hydroxy cortisone?

PATIENT X634
Do I have any?

DOCTOR X634
Yeah the one they just started you on.

PATIENT X634
I got it when I was here before but I found out I got enough now for about three weeks.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  Did they give it to you, have you been using it?

PATIENT X634
Uh I use it every day, I take one pill.

DOCTOR X634
What about the cream?

PATIENT X634
Oh the cream?

DOCTOR X634
Yeah.  

PATIENT X634
I haven't used the cream.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
I use that but the stuff seems to be doing pretty good when I put it on me.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  Well maybe what we'll do is give that cream a shot cause that cream usually stops itching.

PATIENT X634
Yes.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah.  Um so I think that they were on the right track cause that's a good idea.

PATIENT X634
Is there anything that I take inside that might help?

DOCTOR X634
I'm not sure there is for the type of @@@.

PATIENT X634
I have a xxxadryl or something like that that uh.

DOCTOR X634
Right.  The problem is that the xxxadryl can also have other affects and can make you tired and kind of goofy and so we're.

PATIENT X634
I'm tired about this.

DOCTOR X634
Right.  We don't want to make that any worse.  Um and some of the reason you're tired is cause you haven't been sleeping too well.  I think the cream is a good way to go though for starters.  Um first off it feels pretty good if you're itching and it does decrease the itch a fair amount.

PATIENT X634
Well I'm trying to locate exactly what it is and get rid of it.

DOCTOR X634
Right.  So that's.

PATIENT X634
I'm checking my food.  I drank a whole lot of tea, all kinds of tea.  I quit all of it, all of a sudden, cause my daughter told me that's bad on my liver.  I said well it could be.  I said I don't have to have it.  I'm trying to check my sugar and my salt and trying to get an idea as to what's creating this.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah so it looks like it's not your liver um cause the last time I checked your liver that was fine.  Sometimes that can cause something.  Um and you're not on it, sometimes some pain medications cause itching but it doesn't look like you're on any of those either.  So um not totally sure what it is but I think and we don't see any rashes.  If we saw rashes then Dermatology might be even, they have a lot more information for us.  Since it's just kind of a.

PATIENT X634
Well my skin now is a you know a funny color in the last month.

DOCTOR X634
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X634
It's giving signs and something like a puzzle or something.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah so we'll talk to DOCTOR.  I think we should give the cream that they prescribed you, the hydrocortisone cream.  I think we should give that a shot and if that doesn't do it then we can maybe get you a dermatology appointment.  But I'll talk to DOCTOR and see how he feels.  Um any problems with your heart?  Any chest pain, trouble breathing?

PATIENT X634
No I haven't.  I @@@ she never mentioned a concern with my heart too.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
In 08 I took an operation where they run a wire up from your legs.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah.

PATIENT X634
To your heart and it sort of stopped an intermittent condition.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
I didn't never get the full results of that and DOCTOR is still giving me a heart pill that relaxes my heart to a certain extent.

DOCTOR X634
Right.  So.

PATIENT X634
I got the operation, one of them wasn't necessary I guess.

DOCTOR X634
So what I'll do, let me see if I can bring up the report here.

PATIENT X634
I'd like to get more information on it.  Is it in my files?

DOCTOR X634
So it should be.  Let's see if it's in here.  I'll look a little bit further.  Back in June of 2008.  There we go.  

PATIENT X634
Do you think a dermatologist would be able to give a better idea as to what's happening?

DOCTOR X634
Well I'm not sure that they would without a rash.

PATIENT X634
I don't know whether I got a rash or not.

DOCTOR X634
Okay we can take a look.

PATIENT X634
Fine with me.

DOCTOR X634
Alright.  

PATIENT X634
Start right here where it itch and on the side and I been scratching and I might have a little rash right now.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah it looks a little bit irritated.  That might be some from your scratching.

PATIENT X634
Yeah it's just on the outside.

DOCTOR X634
That sort of thing.

PATIENT X634
And down here some on my stomach and right in my back, right across halfway on the back.

DOCTOR X634
Take a look at the back here.

PATIENT X634
Huh?

DOCTOR X634
So I don't see anything that looks like it's.  Yeah sometimes, I'm sure it's itching.  I'm sure that's not the.

PATIENT X634
Well that's the reason I figure I've gotten the hydrocortisone as well as the male something which is a liquid.

DOCTOR X634
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X634
I've tried all of them.  They are helpful but I want to get rid of it.  It keep getting a little worse, a little worse and I need a better.  Somebody that know more about it or give me a good ideas as to what's going on.

DOCTOR X634
Well I'll talk to DOCTOR and see if we can get this in line.

PATIENT X634
Did you see any rash?

DOCTOR X634
I didn't.

PATIENT X634
I try to scratch as less as possible.  Now that it don't bother me too much during the day.  In your opinion do you think a dermatologist would help?

DOCTOR X634
Well that's the question that we need to answer um.  They are really good with the skin and that's what they deal with day in and day out so they're good with skin conditions.

PATIENT X634
Yeah.

DOCTOR X634
Um and without a rash then it's kind of a toss-up and they might have enough information or they might say why did you send him here he doesn't have a rash.  That's kind of what the question we need to answer.  So if we think that they're gonna provide us some useful information then we could send you over there um.  Let's take a look at your legs quick.  You had swelling in the past.  I'll talk to DOCTOR and see what he thinks.  I know he's seen you in the past before.  Uh the swelling has been better than it had been?

PATIENT X634
No it's not too bad, it's tender now.  It's very tender.

DOCTOR X634
Tender there yeah.  Um do you wear compression stockings at all?

PATIENT X634
Off and on.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
I put them on and sometime I have to get them off in a hurry as my legs start cracking.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
I feel more comfortable without them.  I sleep with a pillow under my feet trying to make the blood pressure better.  Then they get crossed at night and sometimes if I don't drink enough water I have to get up and get out of bed and get the circulation going.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah.

PATIENT X634
Then you got to course over the xxx xxx for the clots in the leg and I'm thinking on joining them over there for a while to see if they can find out what's creating the cracks.  I get on my knees, I only stand on my knees ten minutes and then up in my thought they're saying the blood starts clouding up and everything is getting hard.

DOCTOR X634
Uh-huh.  Are you still taking aspirin?

PATIENT X634
I took an aspirin today.  I take one in the day and sometime I take one at night but.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
I take one a day anyway.

DOCTOR X634
Alright and do you get that from us or do you get that from somewhere else?

PATIENT X634
I get them somewhere else.

DOCTOR X634
Okay that's fine.  Um let's see.  Uh any problems urinating?

PATIENT X634
I didn't hear that.

DOCTOR X634
Any problems urinating?

PATIENT X634
No.  I take a good pill for that.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
It's called tamsulosin and that's very good.

DOCTOR X634
Alright that's fine.

PATIENT X634
It keeps me regulated.

DOCTOR X634
Have you gotten a pneumonia shot in the past?  The pneumonia shot?

PATIENT X634
Say what?

DOCTOR X634
Have you got a pneumonia vaccination in the past?

PATIENT X634
Oh yes.  That's been about six years ago.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  That's in 2001 and that's been nine years.  Alright, I'll go talk to the boss okay.

PATIENT X634
Okay.

DOCTOR X634
And I'll be back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:40  DOCTOR IN:  41:27)

DOCTOR X634
Alright so I'll put in a couple of consults and he does think it's not gonna hurt to get you to see Dermatology so we're gonna put that in.  And you haven't ever seen them before is that correct?  You haven't ever seen them?

PATIENT X634
Huh?

DOCTOR X634
You haven't ever seen Dermatology?

PATIENT X634
No.  Can we tell them it's necessary for the doctor to come up with something that we use on the outside?

DOCTOR X634
Yeah hopefully we'll see what they say um and how long has the itching been going on again?

PATIENT X634
About a month and a half.  I used to take use some pills they called xxxadryl that I used to take for allergies or something.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah they still do that but like we talked about it can sometimes cause you to be, so it makes you tired and a little bit loopy and once people get above about 65, which you're a little bit above that, we try not to give it cause it sometimes can make you too tired and makes you confused so we want to avoid that.  Looks like you're really with it here.

PATIENT X634
And if it solves the purpose I have @@@ of it.

DOCTOR X634
Uh it's kind of a risk and benefit.  I think we'll see if there's anything else we can do cause we'd rather have you a little bit itchy and alert than confused and not.

PATIENT X634
Uh what did DOCTOR say?

DOCTOR X634
He said we'll get you to see Dermatology and see if they give us anything, any information.

PATIENT X634
Yeah that's something would ease my mind.

DOCTOR X634
We'll have them schedule that out front.

PATIENT X634
Did he say anything about that heart examination I got?

DOCTOR X634
He actually looked at it and it looked like it was um, there's some atherosclerosis which is like the vessels being a little bit um, a little bit narrowed but there's nothing, like no like lesion there that's causing your problem.  There's no blockages.

PATIENT X634
Or did that correct the intermittent heartbeat?

DOCTOR X634
So that probably didn't correct it um.  Or did you have a procedure where they went in and like burned some of the heart tissue?

PATIENT X634
I don't know, you know he went up in there with a wire sort with something on the end, it was supposed to do its job but it was I'd have to read the full report again.

DOCTOR X634
And you just had that once is that right?

PATIENT X634
Yes, that way.

DOCTOR X634
Okay so yeah what they did is they checked um, they checked the uh vessels of the heart to make sure that wasn't causing the problem and that wasn't it and so they just put you on the medications, one of the medications you're on is to control the heart rate and so that was the plan.  

PATIENT X634
So he said that heart wasn't in uh.

DOCTOR X634
So your heart rate's fine now which is what we really look at.  That's kind of how we follow it.  Okay.  So you've seen the ear doctors about your hearing aid right?

PATIENT X634
Yes I've seen, they tuned up my hearing aid.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
And told me that I'd have to get a confirmation or something to get my ears checked Thursday so that the hearing aids are the correct ones for my hearing.

DOCTOR X634
Okay so you're gonna go back to the Audiology Department?

PATIENT X634
Yes.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  We can set that up.  So what we'll do is, you can take this paper out front, they'll schedule the appointment for the hearing aid in a couple weeks, Dermatology hopefully within two weeks.  I'm not sure how long it takes to get in there.  It might be a little bit longer than that.

PATIENT X634
Alright.

DOCTOR X634
And then uh you'll come back here in about four months.  So it looks like, do you need any refills on your medications?

PATIENT X634
I don't know do I?

DOCTOR X634
Let's see.

PATIENT X634
Take a quick look for me.  He got a DOCTOR got very good hopes I'd be alive four months from now.

DOCTOR X634
Yep.  He does.  And you get your medications in the mail?

PATIENT X634
I'll pick it up.

DOCTOR X634
Oh you pick it up.

PATIENT X634
They send some in the mail; it's something they take out every year.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  Alright it looks like you've got, looks like you've got enough medications so you should be set.

PATIENT X634
I have any refills on all of them?

DOCTOR X634
Yep you've got refills on everything.

PATIENT X634
Good, that's fine.  I hope I don't have to itch before I see Derm.

DOCTOR X634
Yeah you should be able to see them before it itch gets bad.

PATIENT X634
Wonder if the dermatologist possibly could tell me, if he has any ideas of what's going on I think, he should have.

DOCTOR X634
Hopefully yeah, hopefully.  See if they have any reminder for me before you go.  Sometimes they have some questions that they want us to ask you every once in a while.  

PATIENT X634
You're not giving me any type of medicine or anything I think.

DOCTOR X634
Nothing new.

PATIENT X634
Nothing new.

DOCTOR X634
Uh do you use tobacco?  Do you still smoke?  Have you ever smoked?

PATIENT X634
Yes.  Like a chimney.

DOCTOR X634
When did you quit?

PATIENT X634
Oh I quit about 24 years ago.

DOCTOR X634
Oh wow alright.  So about 1985, something like that.

PATIENT X634
Uh longer than that uh I quit smoking let's see after I was on my program for 7 years, I'm an alcoholic.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.

PATIENT X634
So I quit drinking in '75 and it was seven years from '75 when I quit smoking.

DOCTOR X634
Uh '84.

PATIENT X634
Alright.  So it's been quite some time.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  And um have you ever done something called an Advanced Directive?

PATIENT X634
Say that again.

DOCTOR X634
Have you ever done an Advanced Directive?  It basically is uh, you fill out a form that says what you'd want done in certain scenarios so.

PATIENT X634
You mean when you die?

DOCTOR X634
Well or before.  If something would happen where your health gets a little bit, gets worse.

PATIENT X634
I want them to do the best you can to keep me going.

DOCTOR X634
Okay.  Let's see.

PATIENT X634
I haven't lost faith in this world, even though it's cruel at times.

DOCTOR X634
Alright.  Alright sir that should do you.

PATIENT X634
Okay.

DOCTOR X634
Let us know if there's anything we can do for you in the meantime and they'll schedule those appointments out front.

PATIENT X634
All I do is take this out front?

DOCTOR X634
Yep, just show them at the front desk.

PATIENT X634
Okay thank you doctor.

DOCTOR X634
Alright sir, take care.

PATIENT X634
Leave the door open?

DOCTOR X634
Leave it open.

PATIENT LEAVES:  51:45.

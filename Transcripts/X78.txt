PATIENT X78
Uh-huh.

To help you with the blood pressure.  Have you been able to take that or just kind of put it off.

PATIENT X78
I put it on the back burner and you know.

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78
Yeah actually before that happened, the last time I came or whatever he said the blood pressure was uncontrolled.

DOCTOR X78
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X78
But today she took it, she saw; well you can see the note there.

DOCTOR X78
Yes.

PATIENT X78
It's high again or something.

DOCTOR X78
I'll recheck it.

PATIENT X78
Yeah.

DOCTOR X78
But I mean that's not the biggest issue right now.

PATIENT X78
Right.

DOCTOR X78
I know you saw the dermatologist and they gave you that cream for the eczema, how's that?

PATIENT X78
@@@.  Yeah you know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78

DOCTOR X78 
@@@ you follow up in two months and that was in September but of course that.

PATIENT X78
Right.

DOCTOR X78
Everything happened with the uh shooting and what not.

PATIENT X78
Right.

DOCTOR X78
Um, other than that, anything else we need to address today?

PATIENT X78
No, like I say @@@ someone to talk with a psychiatrist or whatever.

DOCTOR X78
@@@.

PATIENT X78
And also I'm thinking maybe some stuff to stop smoking.

DOCTOR X78
Good.

PATIENT X78
I want to stop smoking so.

DOCTOR X78
How much are you smoking right now?

PATIENT X78
Right now about five or six cigarettes a day you know.  @@@ through a pack yet, but I have six enough.

DOCTOR X78
Um you want to be put in the Smoking Cessation Clinic?

PATIENT X78
Well.

DOCTOR X78
Because they actually have a special clinic and work with you a few times and help you to get your stuff together, to help you stop smoking.

PATIENT X78
Yeah and @@@ try to take @@@.

DOCTOR X78
So @@@ it's headed up by the Social Work Department and @@@ some of it is actually you know over the phone, it's not like AA where you come in you know for meetings.

PATIENT X78
Okay.

DOCTOR X78
Um then they can set you up with an initial appointment and then they can give you the medication.  There are nicotine patches that can help you, @@@ to help you with depression and help you increase your energy levels um to do a little bit better but um and that's gonna help stop smoking as well with the smoking cessation so.  Um I mean I can refer you to the Smoking Cessation Clinic and if it doesn't work for you logistically you don't have to come.

PATIENT X78
Okay.

DOCTOR X78
That's totally fine.  

PATIENT X78
Okay.

DOCTOR X78
It's just what I would recommended since we have it that opportunity here.

PATIENT X78
Yeah.

DOCTOR X78
I think it's worth it to you to explore it with all that you've.

PATIENT X78
Yes, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X78
Do it yes, cool.

PATIENT X78
Yeah.

DOCTOR X78
Um and uh any heavy alcohol use, drinking at home?

PATIENT X78
Not heavy.  I do drink about a six-pack and a half a week.  @@@.

DOCTOR X78
Okay.

PATIENT X78
And it has not increased.  Actually it decreased a lot.  I haven't been drunk.  Just some beers yeah.

DOCTOR X78
Okay.

PATIENT X78
That's all, no heavy drinking.

DOCTOR X78
And you're smoking how many cigarettes?

PATIENT X78
About six a day.  Six or seven a day.

DOCTOR X78
Now the only thing to be cautioned of is once @@@ pain medication that you're on, is one of the components is Tylenol and it clears through the liver.  Alcohol also gets cleared from the liver.  You shouldn't take them both together.

PATIENT X78
No I don't, yes I know.

DOCTOR X78
And because these can actually cause the liver damage and @@@ I don't want that to happen.

PATIENT X78
Okay, yeah.

DOCTOR X78
So I'd say if anything you know, until you start backing off the Vicodin and the Norco pain medication, I wouldn't drink.

PATIENT X78
Okay.

DOCTOR X78
Um actually it's at the critical level right now you know where you have to worry about you know liver spasticity but nevertheless it could you cause some damage to your liver or some inflammation and I @@@.

PATIENT X78
Yeah.

DOCTOR X78
But I mean @@@ if you weren't taking the pain medication.

PATIENT X78
Right.

DOCTOR X78
@@@.

PATIENT X78
That's cool, no problem.

DOCTOR X78
Okay let me take a look at your lungs, just have a seat if you want to sit up here.  I'm gonna check your blood pressure.  A lots happened since the last time.

PATIENT X78
Yeah.

DOCTOR X78
Holy cow.  Deep breath.  @@@.

PATIENT X78
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X78
@@@ alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X78

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78
When it happened yes.

DOCTOR X78

DOCTOR X78
Okay, what was the date of that?

PATIENT X78
November 21st.  November 21st, that's all I can say, I got a tetanus shot in the arm yeah.

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78

PATIENT X78
@@@.

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78
Okay.

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78
Okay.

DOCTOR X78
And if you know, I just want to reiterated and like I said before with the alcohol and the pain medications both @@@ from the liver @@@.  So that the @@@ liver function.  And next is the blood pressure, I think the reason @@@ pretty high is that because you have pain.

PATIENT X78
Yeah.

DOCTOR X78
Um and on top of that all the stress regarding anything that's going on with your leg and you had some hypertension or high blood pressure from before.

PATIENT X78
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X78
So I'd like to increase the dose of your high blood pressure medicine and I want you to start taking those @@@.  And in that regard we'll check the kidney function today and all your electrolytes cause this can kind of mess up your electrolytes um and then in about 2-4 weeks, at your convenience come back for a repeat blood pressure check with the nurse and repeat the lab making sure that everything is okay.

PATIENT X78

PATIENT X78
Yes do that.

DOCTOR X78
Okay, it'll go out today um and you come back in about 2-4 weeks for a repeat of your labs.  Now I don't know when you can get in to see the psychiatrist or the psychologist uh it might be two, three, four weeks.

PATIENT X78
Okay.

DOCTOR X78
I put in for them to see you a little bit sooner than more than two weeks.  I don't know if that works in their schedule.  If you have any problems or you can't get in for a long time, what I'd recommend you do is just go to the Mental Health @@@ Center but I'm gonna write down the number for you okay.

PATIENT X78
Yeah.

DOCTOR X78

PATIENT X78
And this is for the lab?

DOCTOR X78

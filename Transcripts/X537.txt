Um I feel like I have restless leg and I was seeing on the TV um restless leg syndrome.

DOCTOR X537
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X537
And I don't have it every day but I um definitely when I'm laying down have it you know and that's when a lot of times I'll get up and take another metoprolol.

DOCTOR X537
Okay, it's sorry about that it's a Code Blue or something.  Alright.

PATIENT X537
And that's when I'll get up and take a metoprolol and then sit up for a while and what I'll do is try to relax or something.

DOCTOR X537
Okay so do you feel, during the day not at night when you're sleeping I mean during the day do you feel like you're anxious or anxiety, do you notice anything going on?  Do you feel like that?

PATIENT X537
Uh not every day.  Not every day.

DOCTOR X537
Okay.

PATIENT X537
Um but you know and some days you know I am uh you know kind of uh really wound up.

DOCTOR X537
Yeah.

PATIENT X537
I feel yeah.

DOCTOR X537
Uh do you find yourself at night a worrier?

PATIENT X537
No.

DOCTOR X537
Okay so a lot of what you're telling me it seems like its stress with the anxiety.

PATIENT X537
Hmm.

DOCTOR X537
It's what we call generalized anxiety disorder.  @@@ and how they have a lot of anxiety and how they use anxiety it's hard to manifest you know it might be provocations.  @@@ things like that usually from like you have @@@, you can have a lot of sweating, you can't sleep, sleep disturbances, you're like worrying a lot, @@@.

PATIENT X537
But I'm not a worrier.  It's like in each of these cases going back since the day we met I feel like its Christmas morning all, you know all the time.

DOCTOR X537
Yeah.

PATIENT X537
You've heard me say that.

DOCTOR X537
Yes.

PATIENT X537
You know and um you know I've had this you know this feeling um.

DOCTOR X537
Just a lot of anxiety.

PATIENT X537
Yeah I just don't know, I mean I don't know what it is but I just feel like you know there's some sort of, almost like an excitement feeling.

DOCTOR X537
Yeah.

PATIENT X537
You know um.

DOCTOR X537
We need to go over your medicines.  So the metoprolol that's you know a medicine for to regulate the heart rate, blood pressure.

PATIENT X537
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X537
A side effect is that um usually the bad side effect is something that is @@@.  Um they tend to be tired.  But usually it's to your benefit.

PATIENT X537
Yeah.

DOCTOR X537
You know that side effect which is not that bad as long as you don't take too much of it but I feel that I think we'd better address with the meds that act on actual stress so @@@ over the last few years that act on the stressors and then you know when it comes down to it hopefully we can reduce @@@.

PATIENT X537
Hmm.

DOCTOR X537
Uh what kind of hobby do you have?

PATIENT X537
Um well there are things that I use to relax at home and to try to take a little steam off is uh stretching.

DOCTOR X537
Okay.  Alright.  Do you do like yoga or just like regular stretching?

PATIENT X537
Like regular stretching.

DOCTOR X537
Okay.

PATIENT X537
You know um like my @@@.

DOCTOR X537
Okay.

PATIENT X537
You know like I'll sit on the floor and actually try to you know stretch out the muscles you know the yoga stuff you know.

DOCTOR X537
Okay.

PATIENT X537
Um and but that's why sometimes when sometimes when my heart rate gets elevated like I told you um then I take a metoprolol because I feel that my heart rate goes back down on that, cause that's part of helping me relax.

DOCTOR X537
So do you feel anxious at the time your heart rate's goes up?

PATIENT X537
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X537
Okay.  So there's one part of @@@ anxiety, there's another part of is that helps with mood and that is um like certain people you know like normal whatever that is, most people have like a mood profile where like you have peaks and valleys you know it crests and lifts and you know a lot of people get a little more frustrated so what we've had is like you know you feel so great and you're doing things @@@ more energy but then at certain times you go down and you just get feeling like you're really bad, you know you just feel sort of @@@.

PATIENT X537
That's like textbook, last time I looked.

DOCTOR X537
I'm actually one of those people I mean.  Some days I get up and I just want to, like I want to run, I want to go to my @@@, I want to do all the work that I have to do for the month, I could probably do it right now and on other days I'm fine, everything's fine.  So I would say so.

PATIENT X537
And that's one of the things that I'm not complaining about is you know sometimes I'm top of the world and I'll be you know @@@ and I'll see all the progress on the house and I'll.

DOCTOR X537
Yeah.

PATIENT X537
Did this whole house, I'm organizing all the tables, I got roast in the stove, I'm doing really good and then what I don't get done, if it doesn't get done in the next couple days, it just sits there because @@@.

DOCTOR X537

PATIENT X537
Doing, I feel too overwhelmed you know and I don't know what's going on.

DOCTOR X537
Yeah.

PATIENT X537

DOCTOR X537

(Someone knocks on the door and the doctor talks with the person 104:00 - 105:4)

PATIENT X537
He needs some metoprolol.

DOCTOR X537
Yeah.  Okay, alright so.  But the people that deal with that is the @@@ we get it all the time.

PATIENT X537
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X537
Mood is manic and anxiety like um.

PATIENT X537
Yeah I'm on that venlafaxine and we recently upped the dosage on that to 300 and uh man I've been doing much better with depression with that.

DOCTOR X537
So you think, they monitor, they have you um you know like depression here but you have kind of, you have really I would call you more like anxiety disorder it's you know for some reason I feel it's more like a @@@ and then if use more, you know super @@@ or clinically depressed or clinically manic they  call that bipolar.

PATIENT X537
Yeah I'm not that.

DOCTOR X537

I wouldn't take metoprolol for it uh I'll increase what you're doing for @@@.

PATIENT X537
Hmm.

DOCTOR X537

DOCTOR X537

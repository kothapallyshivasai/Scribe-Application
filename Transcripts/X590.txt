DOCTOR X590
PATIENT.  All the way back to the left.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
Okay, @@@ about really don't have to, I don't know about that okay.  How you feeling?

PATIENT X590
Fine.  @@@ weather @@@.

DOCTOR X590
How have your sugars done?

PATIENT X590
High.

DOCTOR X590
Okay how high is high.

PATIENT X590
372, 360.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.

PATIENT X590
I'm at 50 cc a night plus the uh.

DOCTOR X590
Plus the metformin.

PATIENT X590
Metformin right.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  Plus the Glargine.

PATIENT X590
Yes.

DOCTOR X590
The Glargine is 50, the glyburide is 10.

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
And you take that and the glyburide twice a day.

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
The metformin.

PATIENT X590
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  I looked at your, your triglycerides have come down a little bit by 200 points.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
So we're going in the right direction but that's another thing that I want to tackle and I'm debating on how to do that since you're on gemfibrozil you're kind of maxed out on that.  Are you taking um fish oil?

PATIENT X590
No.  I'm allergic to fish, I'm allergic to fish.

DOCTOR X590
So that's a no go okay.  So the blood pressure was good.

PATIENT X590
Yeah I don't have any refills on my medications.

DOCTOR X590
I will make sure everything is refilled.  Actually let me do that right now.  Let's go through it together.  Glyburide you have two refills.  

PATIENT X590
Alright.

DOCTOR X590
I want you to continue that so let me just make sure you have enough okay.  Let's do, actually let's wait when I come back to see if we need to make any changes to anything.  Um you're at 50.  I'm just thinking that we're gonna have to go up on the Glargine.  Um are your sugars 300 consistently throughout the entire day?

PATIENT X590
Yeah.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  What are they right before you go to bed at night?

PATIENT X590
Um if I'm good it gets down to about 278.

DOCTOR X590
278.  What are they in the morning when you wake up?

PATIENT X590
Around 300.

DOCTOR X590
Still in the 300s okay and you're taking, you're taking the Glargine.

PATIENT X590
Yes.

DOCTOR X590
You're taking three of the metformin tabs.

PATIENT X590
Metformin?

DOCTOR X590
Yeah metformin.

PATIENT X590
I take two, two tablets.

DOCTOR X590
You take two of the 500.

PATIENT X590
One in the morning and one at night.

DOCTOR X590
In the morning okay.  So that's okay so that's one thing we should do um, the order here is for you to take three so let's start taking three.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
So morning, noon and at night.

PATIENT X590
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  You were only taking it twice a day.  There are too many things, the triglycerides and the diabetes.  Would you agree with that?

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
Anything else going on?  Okay.

PATIENT X590
This tooth I got and the dentist is watching that now.

DOCTOR X590
Okay good cause I know I don't do teeth, I know nothing about teeth.  Okay um how's the rash?  It looks better.

PATIENT X590
It looks better but I ran out of the lotion, they just refilled me so.

DOCTOR X590
Okay perfect um.

PATIENT X590
I saw Dermatology on the 11th.

DOCTOR X590
Good, good, I'm glad that that's helping.  Um and we can even do metformin, we can even do it four times a day but that's kind of like maxing it out so most people recommend for type 2 diabetes to max out the metformin so to have it 2000 mg a day so that would be you know two in the morning and two at night.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
Something like that.  Since your sugars are so high um I mean that's, it's kind of what I want, I want to go up on that.  I know you should be at least taking three times a day.  Are you taking, are you checking your sugars after meals at all?

PATIENT X590
No.

DOCTOR X590
No.

PATIENT X590
Once in the morning and once at night I check it before I go to bed.  

DOCTOR X590
Okay and so both in the morning and both at bed they're about 300.

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
Um and your last A1c was in June I think.

PATIENT X590
I just had blood taken today so.

DOCTOR X590
Today, is that, did I order.  I saw some of them came back already.  

PATIENT X590
Now uh.

DOCTOR X590
Was it just the triglycerides that I ordered today?

PATIENT X590
I don't know.

DOCTOR X590
Let me see.  I wonder.  There's some that I ordered um right, do it right.

PATIENT X590
I got it taken in the Special Clinic?

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  Okay.  Are you at home right now?

PATIENT X590
Yes.

DOCTOR X590
Living at home okay.  Okay, staying away from the drugs?

PATIENT X590
Oh I did cocaine Sunday but.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.

PATIENT X590
Just a little pinch.

DOCTOR X590
Again we got to keep you away from that, got to keep you away from that.  Alright.  So we got your triglycerides.

PATIENT X590
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X590
And we got your diabetes.  Um cocaine won't help either of those.

PATIENT X590
I know.

DOCTOR X590
Um so let me talk to DOCTOR, can I get you up here to just take a good listen to you?  Um I like that you're checking your sugars twice a day.

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
And that way we can get a good adjustment.  I might actually; I know you already got stuck once today um there's a couple other I might, at least try today.  We did not, oh yeah they did.  Oh yeah they did.  I wonder if that was drawn today.

PATIENT X590
That was drawn today.

DOCTOR X590
The hemoglobin A1c, do you know?

PATIENT X590
That's what they were checking for the fast issue.

DOCTOR X590
Yeah they did the fast.

PATIENT X590
Diabetic.

DOCTOR X590
Yeah and the diabetic one.

PATIENT X590
Yes they done it, okay.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  I'll have to just look for those then.  Okay.  Just breathe normally.

PATIENT X590
I'm doing whatever, you know the oxygen, no not oxygen but you know the breathing machine.

DOCTOR X590
Oh for the sleep apnea.  Remember oh yes I remember that so does that make you feel a little bit better throughout the day?

PATIENT X590
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X590
100% huh.  It's like night and day isn't it?

PATIENT X590
Yes.

DOCTOR X590
Yeah.

PATIENT X590
I'm getting rest at night now so.

DOCTOR X590
Yeah it makes you feel a lot better.  Oh my God it makes you feel a lot better.  I'm glad um, I thank you for reminding me of that, I forgot about that.  Um so we solved one of your problems.

PATIENT X590
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X590
I think we're getting close on the triglycerides.  We got to get those down because like I said they, when they're at such high levels with the diabetes you have an increased risk of heart disease.

PATIENT X590
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X590
So we have to control the diabetes better and we have to control the triglycerides better.  Let me look at some of the medications that we can go up on.  The metformin, I'm thinking that I want to go up to four a day but let me run that by DOCTOR.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
Um.  I'm gonna see how high I can go.  Huh.  You're at the max for glyburide.  Allergic to fish okay.  Yeah cause you went from 1155 for the triglycerides.

PATIENT X590
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X590
To 765 and now we're at 537.

PATIENT X590
It's going down.  You want to get me down to below 4 right?

DOCTOR X590
Yeah I'd like to get you below about 100.

PATIENT X590
Huh.

DOCTOR X590
Have you ever tried a medicine called niacin?

PATIENT X590
No.

DOCTOR X590
I saw that you were on it in the past.

PATIENT X590
What is niacin for?

DOCTOR X590
It was the lipids, the fat in the blood.

PATIENT X590
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X590
Um.  Blood pressure was good today.  Alright, let me see I think.  Let me talk to DOCTOR.  I think I want to go up on the metformin and we'll see what she says.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
Um and I'd like to see if, see what the dose for niacin is and I'd like to try niacin and maybe increasing your simvastatin.  We're getting there slowly.

PATIENT X590
Yeah.

DOCTOR X590
So we're going up slowly and things are coming down so we're going in the right direction.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
So it might take another month or two but I think we're gonna get there okay.

PATIENT X590
Alright.

DOCTOR X590
Along with diet.  Diet's going to be a main thing too you know, fruits and vegetables and stay away from the fatty foods so.  Let me go talk to her real quick.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
And I'll be back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  32:00  DOCTOR IN:  38:21)

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  DOCTOR said it was a good idea um.  Um so the metformin.

PATIENT X590
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X590
You should take it as it's written right now.  So do the.

PATIENT X590
One in the morning and one at night?

DOCTOR X590
Well it's actually written for three times a day.

PATIENT X590
Oh okay so I can.

DOCTOR X590
So take one.

PATIENT X590
At noon.

DOCTOR X590
Morning, noon and night.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
And then we're also gonna increase your Glargine so that's okay we'll get the orders here, medications.  Um so keep taking the glyburide and you take that's two of them twice a day.

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
Okay um you take the Glargine so we're gonna change that.  You're at 50 right now, let's go to 60.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  And you keep getting that by mail?

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  Um so let's do 60.  You get that by mail okay.  Um the metformin it's three times a day.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
So just take it before meals.

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
Right so breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Um the simvastatin we're gonna keep the same.

PATIENT X590
So a half a tablet.

DOCTOR X590
Yep right.  Um okay we need to see what else needs to be refilled, gemfibrozil.

PATIENT X590

DOCTOR X590
Okay, the enalapril.

PATIENT X590

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  Are you still taking insulin at all?  Just for, or those are the syringes.

PATIENT X590

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  

PATIENT X590
I need to order the strips, the vitamin D @@@ strips.

DOCTOR X590
Really.  Does one of the mental health people refill the @@@?

PATIENT X590
@@@ that had refilled today.

DOCTOR X590
Okay so they refilled all of the @@@.

PATIENT X590
Right, that's already done.  I already got them.

DOCTOR X590
Okay they do those.  Um I wonder, do you @@@ to.

PATIENT X590
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X590
We need to make sure of that cause there's no refills on those.

PATIENT X590
Right.  I get them once a month.

DOCTOR X590
And do you have to go.

PATIENT X590
I got to see him once a month.

DOCTOR X590
Okay.  So then I'm okay, I'm not gonna touch those then.  Same with the bupropion.

PATIENT X590
Bupropion and the @@@.

DOCTOR X590
Okay the test strips I will change okay.  Simvastatin.  Okay everything else seems to be in good shape and the glyburide.  Okay so what um, @@@ there's a new one that I want to add too.  It's a non-formulary medication.

PATIENT X590
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X590
Um that's something but I have to get someone to approve it so hopefully, let's see.  Okay so it's 160 mg a day okay.  Okay so you're gonna take one a day of this, it's called fenofibrate.

PATIENT X590
Fenofibrate okay.

DOCTOR X590
Yep and it's for the triglycerides okay so.

PATIENT X590
What's a good time to take it, morning or evening?

DOCTOR X590

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590
I'll put that down.

PATIENT X590
I'm special; I've been here all day.

DOCTOR X590
Length of therapy, medications.  I think I'd say if you want you can go and I'll just finish typing this up so they should mail it to you okay.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
Um and if for some reason they don't approve then I'll have to kind of fight with them to get it approved.

PATIENT X590
No problem.

DOCTOR X590
But it'll be a new, new medication that'll come in the mail.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
That's gonna be daily, so the metformin three times a day right.

PATIENT X590
Right.

DOCTOR X590

DOCTOR X590
Yeah that's gonna be 60.

PATIENT X590
It will be 60.  It'll be 60 on the needle; I'll need to reset this.

DOCTOR X590
But do a 50 and then do a 10.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

DOCTOR X590
And I changed it so I don't know if they'll give you bigger syringes but do a 50 and then do a 10.

PATIENT X590
Okay.

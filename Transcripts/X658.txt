DOCTOR X658

PATIENT X658
I've been feeling kind of sluggish mostly.  Cause I don’t sleep regular.  I have to take a sleeping pill to sleep so.  I had stopped taking them period cause I don't work no more so I stay up all night.

DOCTOR X658
Why were you seen in Urgent Care?

PATIENT X658
Just cause I hadn't seen anybody for a long time so they told me to go to Urgent Care.

DOCTOR X658
Oh okay.

PATIENT X658
So I could get in cause they just told me I had to wait and go to the clinic was so long I got @@@.

DOCTOR X658
Okay.  And why do you think you've put back on all this weight?

PATIENT X658
Cause I don't work no more.

DOCTOR X658
Oh okay.

PATIENT X658
I went to Rehab.  See I used to work here and they told me to go to Rehab and when you come back you could get back on board but I went to Rehab and when I came back they didn't put me back on board and I been sitting at home for like a year now.

DOCTOR X658
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X658
I ain't have nothing to do.

DOCTOR X658
And your sugars at home are usually around 200?

PATIENT X658
Well when I came here and they did it, it was like I don't have no meter at my house.

DOCTOR X658
Oh.

PATIENT X658
So that was one of the reasons I came here so I could you know start getting back into the Diabetic Clinic or something cause I know when she did my blood work it was over 250.

DOCTOR X658
Okay let me put in an order to go to Prosthetics or actually Pharmacy can give you a sugar monitor, I can I'll order that.

PATIENT X658
And if you can, put me in for a PSA because I just found out my brother had surgery a month ago cause he had cancer of the prostate.

DOCTOR X658

PATIENT X658
Yeah cause I eat spaghetti like twice a week and rice once or twice a week.

DOCTOR X658
Well we'll get you hooked up with the MOVE Program again um.

PATIENT X658
Cause once I had the surgery and lost weight, my sugar went down to like 85-90 all the time so I had to stop taking the medicine completely cause then my blood sugar went too low.

DOCTOR X658
Okay.

PATIENT X658
I passed out at work one day but then I stopped taking all medications and I was fine for a couple years.

DOCTOR X658

PATIENT X658
I was taking that and glyburide cause for like a year or a year and a half I was on glyburide but it wasn't working and I was taking like four or five pills a day and they ended up giving me metformin to go with it and told me to take two of them a day with the glyburide.  It brought it down some but not enough.  It was still like 120 or 130 every day.

DOCTOR X658

DOCTOR X658
Okay.  Some people say I drink a beer but it's like a 40 ounce.

PATIENT X658
No, no, no it's a regular but I get the strong beer, the malt liquor.

DOCTOR X658
Okay.  Do you feel you need help trying to stop drinking; do you think that's too much?

PATIENT X658
I did.  I mean I went to Rehab six months.

DOCTOR X658
So you feel.

PATIENT X658
But I'm gonna tell you I didn't make no promises about alcohol but I did stop smoking crack.  I smoked crack for 25 years.

DOCTOR X658

DOCTOR X658
Yeah it's extremely high.

PATIENT X658

DOCTOR X658
Yeah.  It's double what it's supposed to be.

PATIENT X658
Double a 10?

DOCTOR X658
Well it's 11.

PATIENT X658
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X658
Because it should be less than 6.

PATIENT X658
Right.  I had got it down to 7.3.

DOCTOR X658
Yeah.

PATIENT X658
When I was losing the weight cause it was like 10 1/2 and I got it down to 7.

DOCTOR X658
Well let me have you sit up here and um do an exam.

PATIENT X658
Yeah.

DOCTOR X658
Deep breath.  Knees to your chest, any problems.  

PATIENT X658
Well it's kind of sore right here.  Cause there's one time when I was gaining weight back I thought they had opened a vein up.

DOCTOR X658
Oh, pardon.  I think it feels fine, I'm not feeling a hernia or anything like that.

PATIENT X658
Yeah.  I'm talking about down here.  At one time it was hurting for like a week.

DOCTOR X658
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X658
And I thought I'd stretched the stomach thing and it was permanently little.

DOCTOR X658
Oh okay.  Um okay so I think as far as I think our main problems today are the diabetes and the blood pressure.  So we're gonna restart some medications which I'm gonna discuss with DOCTOR.  As far as just health screening type of stuff, I know you had a colonoscopy a few years ago.

PATIENT X658
Yes.

DOCTOR X658
So you're not due for that for eight more years.  You're fine.

PATIENT X658
Yeah.

DOCTOR X658
Um we could check a PSA today um otherwise you just had all your other blood work.

PATIENT X658
Right.

DOCTOR X658
I might, your 1+ on the number which we usually start medications for it looks okay but your triglycerides are really high.

PATIENT X658
Okay.  How.

DOCTOR X658
We don't like that, 473.

PATIENT X658
Okay.

DOCTOR X658
It's supposed to be below 150.

PATIENT X658
I know, I know.

DOCTOR X658
So I might um.

PATIENT X658
But at one time it was 1100.

DOCTOR X658
Oh.  Do you have a family history of that?

PATIENT X658
Yeah I think so.  The other one is on cholesterol medicine.

DOCTOR X658
Or do you want to go on fenofibrate?

PATIENT X658
What that one?

DOCTOR X658
I think I'm probably going to start you on that.  It's a medicine that mostly just works on the triglycerides.

PATIENT X658
Okay.

DOCTOR X658
But otherwise.

PATIENT X658
I know I got it from 1100 to 100 some, I was shocked.  It took about four months but.

DOCTOR X658
Well I'm gonna go talk with DOCTOR about all this and otherwise we'll, I'll get you to see somebody about that MOVE Program, the Diabetes Program.

PATIENT X658
Okay.

DOCTOR X658

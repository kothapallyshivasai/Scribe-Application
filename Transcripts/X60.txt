DOCTOR X60
PATIENT?  

PATIENT X60
PATIENT.

DOCTOR X60
I knew it was that.  How are you sir?

PATIENT X60
How do you do?

DOCTOR X60
I'll take your jacket for you.

PATIENT X60
Thank you.

DOCTOR X60
You're early, were you worried about the snow?

PATIENT X60
Yes.

DOCTOR X60
And how was your drive?

PATIENT X60
Pardon?

DOCTOR X60
How was your drive?

PATIENT X60
Oh I'm only ten minutes away.

DOCTOR X60
Ten minutes away so no problem getting here?

PATIENT X60
But oh, the state or whoever's in charge of all the roads should be complimented on what a wonderful job they do.

DOCTOR X60
I'm gonna grab another chair that we can pull up.  I think they really scared us so.

PATIENT X60
Pardon?

DOCTOR X60
They really scared us and everybody said you know they're working really hard.  Why don't you have a seat.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
How are you feeling?

PATIENT X60
Fine, fine.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.

PATIENT X60
Uh I brought this for you because I got from the last time I got this medicine.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.

PATIENT X60
And then here's the letter I got.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.

PATIENT X60
But this one they said there's no refills.

DOCTOR X60
Okay we can do that for you.  Yeah so, this medicine that you're on is for helping with cholesterol.

PATIENT X60
Yeah.

DOCTOR X60
I think your cholesterol is really good.  I do want to check how we do off of this medication so you're on two other medicines for your cholesterol.

PATIENT X60
I mean I'm glad to see this.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
I just.

DOCTOR X60
Yes I understand.

PATIENT X60
Just so you know about this.

DOCTOR X60
I understand, yeah.

PATIENT X60
Oh.

DOCTOR X60
So you're taking the simvastatin still, which is for your cholesterol and also the niacin will help.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
You still taking those two?

PATIENT X60
Yeah I take my pills religiously, I never miss that.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  Um okay that should come up.  Any other problems with other medications.

PATIENT X60
No, no.  Everything's fine.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.  Um the last time I saw you was in July, what's been going on or how have you been feeling since we saw you last?

PATIENT X60
Well I feel fine.  Everything's going well.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.  

PATIENT X60
My one concern, what if I uh wanted to see you before a scheduled visit, do I just call and.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X60
Talk to the nurse or there's a line to talk to somebody.

DOCTOR X60
Yes.

PATIENT X60
So I can get to you.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh is there's something that you were concerned about or you are concerned about?

PATIENT X60
Well I'm just concerned about; I'm going to a doctor for my PSA.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X60
I do that once a year.

DOCTOR X60
Yes.

PATIENT X60
And if anything turns up on that.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X60
Then I'm gonna leave him and come over here.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  Um so in that case, that would be a urologist that you would see.  So what you could do is you could do one of two options.  I work at xxx and here so I'm only here every other week so sometimes it's hard getting in but usually I have an opening.  We also have an Acute Care Clinic that you can come see anybody at any time so you can get in right away.  Um, but if it's something that you're concerned about your PSA all you need to do is give me a call and I can set up a referral to our urologist so I can get you right there too.

PATIENT X60
I can call you?

DOCTOR X60
So the front desk can give you a number to call for the nurses and the nurses give me the message when you call.

PATIENT X60
I have that number for nurses.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah, yep.  So they give me the message through the computer and I'll either call you right away or do whatever you need done.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
Refill your medicine.

PATIENT X60
Okay, I just, I don't care if it's a week or ten days or whatever.

DOCTOR X60
No, no.

PATIENT X60
If I call you I can.

DOCTOR X60
If you call me and say.

PATIENT X60
I'll get a hold of the nurse number.

DOCTOR X60
Yes any day.

PATIENT X60
And tell her I'd like to hear from you.

DOCTOR X60
Say you just tell her my PSA is high and I want to see either my primary care doctor or a urologist and I'll make that happen.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.

PATIENT X60
That's good.

DOCTOR X60
So yeah but we'll do whatever we can to do the best guess for you what we need to do okay.  When is the last time you saw your urologist?

PATIENT X60
Uh a few weeks ago but I have to go back May 1st for another blood test and another check-up.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  Um.  Any problems or pains that you've been having?

PATIENT X60
No I feel good.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  Um just making sure all of your medicines @@@.  Okay.  So have you been checking your blood pressure at home?  No, you never check your blood pressures?

PATIENT X60
Once in a while but not very often.

DOCTOR X60
It's well controlled today.

PATIENT X60
About every time, every place I go it's always so good that.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X60
I have the little machine.

DOCTOR X60
That's okay.  You don't have to.  If you're feeling sick or whatever, it's good to kind of check it out.

PATIENT X60
And I've been losing weight.

DOCTOR X60
Good.

PATIENT X60
Of course I've been trying to do.

DOCTOR X60
Good.  Are you checking your blood sugars at home?

PATIENT X60
Pardon?

DOCTOR X60
Have you been checking your blood sugars at home?

PATIENT X60
Once in a while.

DOCTOR X60
Okay what kind of numbers are you getting at home?

PATIENT X60
Uh I don't even remember.

DOCTOR X60
100s, 200s, 300s?

PATIENT X60
Oh I don't get up to 300, oh heavens no.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.  The last time we checked you're um hemoglobin A1c what we look for on average it looks well controlled so everything seems to be okay with that okay.  And I see you saw the dermatologist for the lesions on your back and uh they did some scraping of some lesions @@@.

PATIENT X60
Why did we go there, we went there for.

DOCTOR X60
You had uh, there was a rash that we're concerned about and.

PATIENT X60
Oh that's right for the rash yes.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah, yeah.  

PATIENT X60
He was very good and then he took some little uh cancer cells off my face with a little hot however, whatever he put on there.

DOCTOR X60
Yes.

PATIENT X60
That worked very well.

DOCTOR X60
Okay good.

PATIENT X60
And he prescribed a couple salves that worked well.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.  So good.

PATIENT X60
Yeah I don't know what caused that, that was.

DOCTOR X60
Do you know what kind of blood test you're going to be getting,  @@@ said?

PATIENT X60
With my urologist?

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.  Is he going to do like a whole work-up do you know or?

PATIENT X60
I don't know what they do.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.

PATIENT X60
Then he comes up with what the PSA number is.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah okay.  I looked this morning and we don't need any lab work right now but if they're gonna do something that I can look at, you know like, uh like your kidneys and liver and all that, maybe you can get a copy or have them fax it over to us.

PATIENT X60
Well he'll be very happy to give me a copy.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah so that way you don't have to repeat stuff here.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
And we can put that in the system.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  The last time we did blood work everything was really good so I'm not concerned about anything but like I said I don't want to repeat things that they're already doing.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
So why don't you just get that.  Okay.  Um any chest pain, trouble breathing?

PATIENT X60
No.

DOCTOR X60
Appetite's been good?  Did you try to eat healthier and, how are you losing the weight?

PATIENT X60
By eating.

DOCTOR X60
Eating okay.  Doing any activity or exercises?

PATIENT X60
Well I certainly don't consider golfing exercise but I walk.

DOCTOR X60
You walk, that's good.

PATIENT X60
Yeah.

DOCTOR X60
You're not walking I mean you're not golfing right now are you?

PATIENT X60
Well a couple days a week we go hit balls over in the golf dome but you know.

DOCTOR X60
Oh, kind of bad weather to start right now.

PATIENT X60
Yeah.

DOCTOR X60
Um any problems with urinating or bowel movements?

PATIENT X60
No, no.

DOCTOR X60
Not that you've noticed okay.

PATIENT X60
No I feel good.

DOCTOR X60
Sleeping, how are you sleeping?

PATIENT X60
Pardon?

DOCTOR X60
Sleeping okay at night?

PATIENT X60
Oh, yeah well no I dream a little bit but that's you know normal.

DOCTOR X60
Did you hear, feel the earthquake last night?

PATIENT X60
No but my wife did.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
She told me she said my God I heard a terrible noise.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
Like a train.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
And then the bed shook.  I said well that's good.

DOCTOR X60
(Laughter)

PATIENT X60
Well right then she had to clean me out.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
And then talk about the earthquake.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
I said that was an earthquake you felt, well then and there also was a major train accident over in xxx.

DOCTOR X60
Really.

PATIENT X60
So.

DOCTOR X60
They always say I thought that it'd feel like a train or a truck was driving by so they're not sure what's going on.

PATIENT X60
Okay.  Yeah I've been in a couple earthquakes in Japan.

DOCTOR X60
Oh really.

PATIENT X60
But I was too dumb and drunk to know the difference and the Japanese are running out of buildings like.

DOCTOR X60
(Laughter).  Um it wasn't as bad as like in Haiti.  They said that was 500 times worse.

PATIENT X60
Well this one they only said was 3 something.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.  How's your vision, your eyes doing?

PATIENT X60
Great I go to the doctor once a year.

DOCTOR X60
And when was the last time you went?

PATIENT X60
I think I'm due to go to him again in three months or so.  I go the same time every year.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
And uh if you want I can bring a, a report but I've gone two years now with the same glasses.

DOCTOR X60
Great.  Not seeing any spots or blurriness?

PATIENT X60
No he said my eyes are great.

DOCTOR X60
@@@.  Good open your mouth ah.

PATIENT X60
Ah.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  And how's the feeling in your legs.  You can put your glasses down.

PATIENT X60
Fine.

DOCTOR X60
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X60
No.

DOCTOR X60
No.  Okay that looks good.  Let me grab my stethoscope and I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT: 34:56  DOCTOR IN:  35:37)

DOCTOR X60
Sorry about that.  I'll take a listen to your heart.  Take a few breaths for me, in and then out.  Okay.  I'm gonna have you lie back for me.  Any trouble laying flat?

PATIENT X60
No.

DOCTOR X60
No.  Do you have any stairs at home?

PATIENT X60
Any stairs?

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X60
Oh yeah we have a two story house, I'm up and down the stairs all the time.

DOCTOR X60
Any trouble, no problems though okay.

PATIENT X60
I think that's a good way to work-out.

DOCTOR X60
It is.  Let me help you sit up.  So how's the swelling doing?

PATIENT X60
I got my comb in the way.

DOCTOR X60
That's okay.  Is the swelling doing okay?  Do you get more water in the legs or trouble?

PATIENT X60
Yeah only once did you notice that.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
I never, you know I.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  And the way you take the furosemide you're taking that once a day, that's the water pill, this one right here.

PATIENT X60
I don't even know what my pills are for. I take them religiously.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah okay.  Okay.  Squeeze my fingers; let me see how strong you are.  Squeeze.  Noticing any weakness in your arms or legs, no okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X60
Do I pass the strength test?

DOCTOR X60
You do, you do.

PATIENT X60
I could have squeezed harder.

DOCTOR X60
I'd say you were at 55.

PATIENT X60
Pardon?

DOCTOR X60
I'd say you were at 55 or maybe 70.  @@@ up to 80.

PATIENT X60
Oh.

DOCTOR X60
No okay, so I don't think we need to change of your medications.  Everything seems to be doing well from half the blood work and the blood pressure today.  Um when you do go see your urologist, you know grab a copy or just have them fax them over.

PATIENT X60
Well if he says everything's okay.

DOCTOR X60
Yes.

PATIENT X60
I won't call you.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
But if he has some concerns.

DOCTOR X60
Sure.

PATIENT X60
Well what he did, in fact last year he told me you know I don't know why you're really coming anymore.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
He said if we found anything at this stage.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
He said we might even let it go because the cure is worse than the.

DOCTOR X60
It is.

PATIENT X60
And uh so but this time he did a finger examination.

DOCTOR X60
Hmm.

PATIENT X60
And he said it still, there's no hardness and your prostate feels good.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X60
But I'd like to do the blood test again.

DOCTOR X60
Most men die with prostate cancer, not of prostate cancer.

PATIENT X60
Yeah.

DOCTOR X60
So you're right the surgery and the treatment is much worse and as long as you're feeling okay.

PATIENT X60
Right. I don't have any.

DOCTOR X60
There's not complications then we wouldn't mess with it.

PATIENT X60
No.

DOCTOR X60
Most of the people say that at age 80 or even 75 they would stop even testing for that.

PATIENT X60
Well that's what he told me.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah.

PATIENT X60
And I said well let me come back one more year.

DOCTOR X60
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X60
This was gonna be my last visit this year.

DOCTOR X60
Yeah okay.  Well you've seen the eye doctor in the last three months.  You're gonna see your urologist.

PATIENT X60
Those are the only two outside doctors I go to.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.  So what I can do is I still have to get a copy of those blood tests just so we don't have to repeat anything here.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
And if you don't get everything you need then the next time we see you we'll do some blood work for you.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
Make sure everything's doing okay.

PATIENT X60
Yeah if he says I'm alright I let you know.

DOCTOR X60
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X60
But if there's any concern I'd just as soon come back here.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
Do have any specific questions or anything else that we didn't talk about?

PATIENT X60
No you took care of this.

DOCTOR X60
Yep, I renewed that and all the other medications.

PATIENT X60
This is @@@.

DOCTOR X60
Okay.

PATIENT X60
This one, I'm glad this is one less pill.

DOCTOR X60
Yep it is.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
I'm gonna say six months right here but I can see you sooner or later if we need to, does that sound okay?

PATIENT X60
Right.  And I'll call the nurse.

DOCTOR X60
Yep.

PATIENT X60
And then she'll get a hold of you.

DOCTOR X60
And they can give you the number if you don't have it up front okay.

PATIENT X60
Okay and you'll be around for another?

DOCTOR X60
For a little bit longer, not much longer so.

PATIENT X60
How long?

DOCTOR X60
So I'll probably see you one more time and that's it.

PATIENT X60
So where are you heading?

DOCTOR X60
I'm going to be working at xxx full-time.

PATIENT X60
Oh okay.  You're not going out-of-town.

DOCTOR X60
Uh out-of-town.  I'll be at xxx.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
I'll be working in the ER here at xxx once in a while but I won't be in the clinic any longer.  So I'm at xxx three years and @@@.

PATIENT X60
Has it been that long?

DOCTOR X60
Yeah it has been.  But you're such an easy patient, you know you don't cause any trouble that it's been nice having you.

PATIENT X60
Well then I should get a little fix.

DOCTOR X60
Alright.

PATIENT X60
Okay.

DOCTOR X60
I'll have you check out up front so they can put you on the list for appointments and if you need anything you just let me know.

PATIENT X60
I will.  I'll be glad when we can hang.

DOCTOR X60
Be careful in the snow okay.

PATIENT X60
When we can hang these clothes up.

DOCTOR X60
Be careful with the snow out there.

PATIENT X60
I will and thank you very much.

DOCTOR X60
You're gonna take a left and then a right.

PATIENT X60
Okay left and right.

PATIENT LEAVES:  40:35

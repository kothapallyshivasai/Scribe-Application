Lisinopril or.

PATIENT X43
What is it?

PATIENT'S WIFE X43
Lisinopril.  I don't think you have but I take lisinopril but I don't think you've ever taken it though.  Isn't that for blood pressure doctor?

Um, yes and no.

PATIENT'S WIFE X43
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR X43

PATIENT X43
But we now, when I, when I say we're going to cancel the aspirin something, gonna still take them?

DOCTOR X43
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X43
Okay.

DOCTOR X43
Okay you're fine.

PATIENT X43
Yeah and uh you know what is that um, uh.  You gave me some medication uh when my heart wasn't right.

DOCTOR X43
The verapamil?

PATIENT X43
Is that what that is?  What does that do, I mean what is that?

DOCTOR X43
It's a calcium channel blocker so basically it blocks calcium which seems to aggravate muscles um so there are a bunch of different kinds.  The beta blocker it treats the work of your heart.  The lisinopril is an Ace inhibitor, it works @@@ to decrease resistance in your heart but also protects your kidneys.  Most diabetics are on it.  Since your urine and albumin look okay we don't need you to start one right now.

PATIENT X43
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X43
And if that goes high you may need them.

PATIENT X43
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X43
Okay, so I'm actually gonna check a bunch of labs and in February okay.

DOCTOR X349
You're wearing stockings huh?  A little bit of swelling?

PATIENT X349
Yeah.  I take a water pill for that.

DOCTOR X349
Yeah is it because you have venous insufficiency or what?

PATIENT X349
No.  Well I slept with my legs down would that do it?

DOCTOR X349
What?

PATIENT X349
The water on my ankles.

DOCTOR X349

DOCTOR X349
At this point can @@@ sometimes it's hard for them to turn.  It's called, we call it postural instability which means they can do fine but when you turn you have a hard time turning.

PATIENT X349
Well I said that before, my body turns but my legs don't.

DOCTOR X349
Right.

PATIENT X349
I thought that could be @@@.

DOCTOR X349

Uh the other thing I wanted to ask is uh.

PATIENT X349
How soon will I, how often will I see you?

DOCTOR X349
You can see me as often as you like.  I was thinking we can go every six months but if you wanted to see me sooner we can do that too.  Do you want to be seen sooner?

PATIENT X349
Well not really.

DOCTOR X349
No.  Are you having any, are you having any thyroid symptoms?  Cause frequent constipation could be from thyroid.

PATIENT X349

DOCTOR X349
Are you um, you're not gaining weight.  Do you feel like your reaction is slower?  Do you feel fatigued, do you feel like you're @@@?  Do you feel like your hair is getting coarse or anything?

Well.

DOCTOR X349
I can do this, I can do both things.  I can have you see the GI doctor, the stomach doctor.

PATIENT X349
Right.

DOCTOR X349
To see if they want to take a look.  Uh in the meantime before you see them, do you want me to change your medications around to be sure that you get them?

PATIENT X349
No.

DOCTOR X349
No cause I can do this.

PATIENT X349
Well I'm worried about the reflux.

DOCTOR X349
That's what I'm saying I can change that around so instead of taking the omeprazole I can try to, I can increase your dose to see if it's different.

PATIENT X349
Oh really?

DOCTOR X349
Yeah I can have you do that um.

PATIENT X349
That's the pills or the liquid?

Alright.  Is it stronger?

DOCTOR X349
Yeah and then I can increase to see if you benefit.

PATIENT X349
Okay.

DOCTOR X624

PATIENT X624
And I can pick them up today uh.  Yeah that way in about three months I can make another round.

DOCTOR X624
That we'll see you, okay, yeah let's do that.  Um let me just check a couple things I need to do.  So last time we checked your cholesterol was recently, no it was about a year ago.  I'm gonna order labs for you.  You do not have to get them done today.

PATIENT X624
Well I might as well get it cause I.

DOCTOR X624
Cause you're here you'll get them.

PATIENT X624
I haven't eaten nothing.

DOCTOR X624
You haven't eaten?

PATIENT X624
Since 3 o'clock yesterday in the afternoon.

DOCTOR X624
Why not?

PATIENT X624
I'm getting ready for @@@.

DOCTOR X624
@@@ smart.

PATIENT X624
Maybe you wanted to uh.

DOCTOR X624
Alright I.

PATIENT X624
Blood tests.

DOCTOR X624
Yes I do but I didn't think you'd go this long.  Okay let's check some labs; I'll refill your meds.  Um and you had a flex sig in 2006 that showed some diverticulosis.  Are you interested at all in doing a colonoscopy where they go up through the bottom and they take a look for colon cancer?  The test you had in the past was sort of an incomplete test.

PATIENT X624
It was incomplete cause.

DOCTOR X624
It was uncomfortable.

PATIENT X624
It was real uncomfortable.  They could at least put uh a local.

DOCTOR X624
Yeah I agree.  So the one that I want you to get is more complete and they completely knock you out.

PATIENT X624
Well I don't need a complete knock out.

DOCTOR X624
But they sedate you so that you don't remember it.  You can respond like when they're asking you questions you can respond but you won't remember it so it's not painful or anything.

PATIENT X624
That's what mine was, that's where I got the @@@. 

DOCTOR X624
You want to do that okay.

PATIENT X624
I don't think they found anything unusual but they.

DOCTOR X624
No, no, they didn't.  It just wasn't a complete study so I just wasn't sure if you.

PATIENT X624
I've been going on the @@@ to work on the stomach.

DOCTOR X624
Oh okay, okay.  Well think about it.  If you decide you want to change your mind and do it we can set you up okay.  Um otherwise everything is looking pretty good.  You're doing a real good job.  Your blood pressure looks great.  You're taking your aspirin.  Um sounds like all the GU stuff and your urology stuff has gotten.

PATIENT X624
Right, no problem.

DOCTOR X624
Good well let me go talk to the boss.  Let me take a listen to you, then I'll talk to the boss and we'll get you out of here.  We'll send you to the Lab; we'll send you to the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X624
Okay.

DOCTOR X624
Alright.  Go ahead and lean forward just a little bit.  Forward, there you go.  Big breath.  Another one.  Good you can breathe normal, I'm gonna listen to your heart.  Good.  Let me go talk to the boss and we'll get you out of here.
 
(DOCTOR OUT: 30:11  DOCTOR IN:  36:42)

DOCTOR X624

PATIENT X624

DOCTOR X624
Okay.

PATIENT X624
Another one.

DOCTOR X624
This one right here.

PATIENT X624
This one here, I don't know what.

DOCTOR X624
We can send you over to the Dermatology Clinic.  This is a little growth like you said.  But they're usually not too bad.  Does it bother you?

PATIENT X624
It uh.  No, it's a little reddish and a little swollen at one time.

DOCTOR X624
Okay.

PATIENT X624
But uh it went away, like it's right now.

DOCTOR X624
Okay, okay.  Um let's keep an eye on it.  If it changes in size, changes in color you come back and let me know okay.

PATIENT X624
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X624
Um cause then I will send you over to the skin doctors.

PATIENT X624
Right, dermatologist.

DOCTOR X624
Yes, you got it.  Amlodipine 30 day supply.  So I changed your finasteride medication to be a three month supply, cause the way Urology wrote it out it was only 30 pills um otherwise I refilled your amlodipine and your lisinopril.  I'm going to put in for your labs now and you can just go get it.  Let's see.  And then why don't you come back and see me in three months, does that sound good?

PATIENT X624
Yeah.

DOCTOR X624

PATIENT X624
Yeah I'll come back in May, more or less about the same 13th, 16th.

DOCTOR X624
Yeah they'll send you a letter with the date.  It'll be a Wednesday afternoon that I can promise you.  That's the only day I'm here.

PATIENT X624
Okay.

DOCTOR X624
Okay.  So let me know if anything, you know you need to change anything or you can come back earlier.  Okay.

PATIENT X624
I look forward to it.

DOCTOR X624
Okay.

PATIENT X624
Okay help me.

DOCTOR X624
Well you can take this if you'd like it, it's a type of @@@ but you don't need it for anything.

PATIENT X624
She said I could give it.

DOCTOR X624
@@@.  Okay sir.

PATIENT X624
Okay I got to go back here uh.

DOCTOR X624
Yes, yes.  You might want to stop at the Pharmacy first and take a number cause I know that line can get really long.

PATIENT X624
Oh yeah okay.

DOCTOR X624

If I just take that shoe off, then I got to sit over here.

DOCTOR X341

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Well I have a pain still though in my toe.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Alright, these are socks @@@.  Anytime I'm walking I need and these are a little bit smaller right now.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Well that's one half.

DOCTOR X341
So that's the spot in here huh?

PATIENT X341
Right here, it's focusing right up in here somewhere when I walk.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
It continues.  Now in the morning just right in here it'll be thin in the morning and it's now.

DOCTOR X341
Sort of like swelling yeah.

PATIENT X341
Okay.

DOCTOR X341
Have you gone to Podiatry, I forget?

PATIENT X341
Podiatry?

DOCTOR X341
Yeah the foot doctors.

PATIENT X341
No, not at all.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Another you know if I just pull that up, it did swell on me my foot over here on walking because of what happened to me this morning, oh here, my ankle.

DOCTOR X341
What happened to you?

PATIENT X341
You got me.  I was starting @@@ got worse.  Okay now this one here.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
You can see this one here.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
And this is the way it is, usually at the end of the day, kind of still swollen like that.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
And in the morning this will not be like this I mean.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Not a lot.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Okay, now a week and a half ago I got out of bed, so I put these on.

DOCTOR X341
You take them off @@@.

PATIENT X341
Oh okay, okay, good.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Uh I got a virus, bad virus a week and a half ago.  I was in the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
@@@ get antibiotics for it.  Its congestion and I'm sitting at home for three days on my back, laying on my back.

DOCTOR X341
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X341
And I don't know if it had something to do with my intake of the amount of juice that I had but I guess I drank 3 1/2 gallons of orange juice and lemonade and I didn't know it has a lot of acid in it and if that's just part of the gout or something.  Maybe I'm wrong about it.

DOCTOR X341
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X341
And maybe I am so anyhow I get this great pain right in here right through my ankles when I walk, it's like pins.  It just occurred this morning and then also getting a little stiffness in my knees.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Here and it just occurred.  It started like yesterday.  I started sitting at my kitchen table, I felt a little stiffness and then tonight, last night I felt more and then this morning I was like walking like this I couldn't move it.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.  Now why were you laying down for so long?

PATIENT X341
Because of the virus I had, I was on uh.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
@@@ that I shouldn't have been @@@ this.

DOCTOR X341
Okay, alright so how is your breathing doing?

PATIENT X341
Alright.

DOCTOR X341
Do you feel better?

PATIENT X341
Well my breathing is a little bit heavier now cause I got this virus now, it's just something that occurred.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
In my lungs.

DOCTOR X341
But are you definitely getting better with that virus you think?

PATIENT X341
Well I hope so yeah because it was terrible.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
I mean I was coughing up phlegm 50 times a day and now I've coughed up maybe a few times, that's all.

DOCTOR X341
Okay, no fevers or chills?

PATIENT X341
Uh no.

DOCTOR X341
Okay, okay.  You're not feeling real short of breath?

PATIENT X341
No.

DOCTOR X341
Every time you really exert yourself?

PATIENT X341
No, well I could sometimes you know if I go from the second floor of steps.  It's just I get the pain.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Cause when you have pain you have exhaustion so you cough.

DOCTOR X341
Are you still taking the doxycycline, the antibiotic they gave you?

PATIENT X341
The what?

DOCTOR X341
The antibiotic they gave you?

PATIENT X341
Oh yeah, I got to go four more days on it.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
I got four more pills.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Now I stopped taking the water pills about three days ago.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
I don't know if I should have done that or not.

DOCTOR X341
Well how do you think you've been doing since you stopped it?

PATIENT X341
Well since I stopped it you know, like I said, in the mornings they're thinner than what they are now but you know this stuff's come back every night and it's kind of like this.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X341
So I don't know what to do and how long is it going on for you what I'm saying you know.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.  Well I think I'd probably keep you on something.  Um you're taking two tabs by mouth every morning and you were getting 80 twice a day.  I'd probably keep you on, so I think there's a couple of things.  Um you know I think you probably did have some gout which is why you got better with the steroids.  Um and now we have you on colchicine which is another treatment for gout but the thing.

PATIENT X341
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X341
With steroids is you can only go on it for a short period of time cause it's really bad for you to be on.

PATIENT X341
Colchicine.

DOCTOR X341
Colchicine, you're on that now.

PATIENT X341
Yeah, I got about maybe about eight more tablets, ten more tablets.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah so.

PATIENT X341
Is it really bad?

DOCTOR X341
No I'm saying the steroids.  The prednisone is what you can't be on for a long time.

PATIENT X341
I don't have no more steroids.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah so we gave you that for a short period.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.

DOCTOR X341
Now we have you on colchicine.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.

DOCTOR X341
Um and um it looks like if we discontinue that for a little while and switched it to a different medicine for the gout.

PATIENT X341
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X341
You're saying this toe here is still hurting you a little?

PATIENT X341
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
If I bend it like this you'll feel it, when I do one of these here.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
You can feel it kind of from and it goes right up in here.  It's the main part of the toe @@@ in the foot you know and it's kind of the same right here also.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.  

PATIENT X341
Alright.

DOCTOR X341
Does it hurt you like just to touch it?

PATIENT X341
No.

DOCTOR X341
No.

PATIENT X341
Uh no, no.  A little bit yeah right here.  Now if I press down on this part I will get pain.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Right here uh this one here a little bit.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Not much.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.  Well I think what we could probably do today is stop the colchicine and switch you to something that you could take.  I think you know it looks like you may have a problem with gout you know over time.

PATIENT X341
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X341
So I think allopurinol is the medicine that you can stay on forever to prevent the gout from flaring up again.

PATIENT X341
Oh.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.  The prednisone and the colchicine are kind of short term medications to use when things are really bad but the allopurinol you can stay on, it should keep that uric acid level down and it should prevent you from getting the flare-ups of your gout.

PATIENT X341
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.  So I think we should probably do that today.

PATIENT X341
Uh, okay now getting back to the second matter though, this recent thing and like I say in my ankle.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
What causes this?

DOCTOR X341
Well I don't know but maybe it was because you were not moving around very much for a couple of days and now you're kind of up on your feet again.

PATIENT X341
Really?

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Because um see I was moving around in the hospital Tuesday, I had to go to different departments.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
It was Tuesday, yeah I think it was Tuesday, I think it was Tuesday.

DOCTOR X341
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X341
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday.

DOCTOR X341
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X341
Yeah and I told her I was real tired out in my legs.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Uh were in pain from walking, just walking in the hospital here.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
I don't think, should that have been because according to my therapist I should be walking more and look at this now you know.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah, yeah, well you know it takes some time to get into it so I think you know you should be pushing yourself a little at a time to get back if you can uh but it's not surprising that when you first really get into it that you might have some pain at the end of the day either okay.  So what you want to do is stay active and you know every day kind of push yourself a little bit more but you have to be kind of patient with this okay.  Um I think we should definitely get you into Podiatry because you display, you know even once we get your gout completely taken care of and the fluid, you have pretty beat up feet.

PATIENT X341
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Okay sorry about that.

DOCTOR X341
So, no it's fine.

PATIENT X341
This is uh due to a sport, @@@ and it's kind of taking up the parking place.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
In the other toes and this one is coming in.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.  So some of the pain I think may be just related to your, the way your feet are.

PATIENT X341
And my right one is the bad one.  I have this over here holding cause the toe kind of reaches over the first toe.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Over the big toe.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah, yeah.  So they may be able to help just with some special shoes and.

PATIENT X341
Oh I've gone to foot doctors before and it's pretty painful what they give you.  I know I was walking on cardboard at one time and it was awful.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
I mean, what I need is surgical where the toe is brought back @@@.

DOCTOR X341
I was going to say.

PATIENT X341
And do this you know.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah they're the ones that do the surgery too so.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.

DOCTOR X341
You know.

PATIENT X341
I went there one time and I did ask about my feet and I did.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
And they kind of said no they won't do it.

DOCTOR X341
Let's send you back and see what they think now okay.

PATIENT X341
Okay.

DOCTOR X341
It's not going to hurt anything.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.  It's just that since the 4th of February I am just up to my neck with going to the hospital, coming here so much.  I just came out of a PTSD class.

DOCTOR X341
Oh.

PATIENT X341
Which I was taking for like uh two weeks now.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
And I've been coming here and that was out of the medical part and now the mental thing.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
And then now.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah you've had a lot going on lately.

PATIENT X341
@@@.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.  Well okay.

PATIENT X341
And I'd of like to get something done.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah, yeah.  Well even if they @@@ again so.

PATIENT X341
Alright.

DOCTOR X341
I think the next time they see you we'll at least @@@.

PATIENT X341
Alright oh I see.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Uh but can you tell me what I have, cause like still with that, it just happened this morning.

DOCTOR X341
That feeling of the numbness kind of @@@.

PATIENT X341
The pins in here and I can't, in my ankles, ankles when I walk.

DOCTOR X341
Has it been there continuously all day?

PATIENT X341
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah and do you have numbness and tingling on the bottom of your feet usually?

PATIENT X341
No.

DOCTOR X341
No pain?

PATIENT X341
No.

DOCTOR X341
No okay.  So are you having pain in general anymore or no?

PATIENT X341
Uh I get a little stiffness in the knees where I could go and they loosen up and I got more power in my leg and the operating knee is better @@@ and power but not recently in the last 24 hours, not since I got this stiffness cause this stiffness also affected my knees too.

DOCTOR X341
Okay, okay, okay.  I don't know exactly.

PATIENT X341
I don't know I just thought that maybe three gallons of orange had something to do with it.

DOCTOR X341
Well that's a lot of; I wouldn't drink that much orange juice.

PATIENT X341
Yeah I know that now.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Yeah and it does have acid in there right?

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Is it part of this I don't know?

DOCTOR X341
Uh it's hard to say.

PATIENT X341
Oh I see.

DOCTOR X341
But I would kind of; it's good to drink water but not so much juice okay.

PATIENT X341
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X341
Try to drink more just regular water.  You can have a little orange juice but no more than one or two glasses a day okay.

PATIENT X341
Yeah but I was sick when I was at the house all day.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
So.

DOCTOR X341
But yeah I don't know what would cause.  If you have continuous numbness and tingling in your feet then we need to know about it but let's see if it goes away.  I mean I don't know what caused it.

PATIENT X341
It just occurred now, this thing on the ankle.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.  So I think we just need to understand what you were doing with the water pills.  So you were taking 80 mg in the morning and 80 at night right?

PATIENT X341
Yeah I was taking it in the morning and at night.

DOCTOR X341
And now you're not taking anything?

PATIENT X341
I didn't take it in the last three days.  One of the reason is cause I got so sick with this virus.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
I just couldn't handle all the pills you know.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
I wanted to get this out of me you know so I don't know if that had anything to do with the swelling right now.

DOCTOR X341
I think what I'd like to do is have, keep you on a small dose of the water pill, less than what you were taking just once a day.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Because you know the urination part is irritating after a while you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
It's quite abundant.

DOCTOR X341
Sure, sure, okay.  Um okay let me talk to DOCTOR cause I know he was interested with what's going on with your feet last time you were here okay.  So let me listen to your lungs first.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.  I might need to get something here cause I still got congestion.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah, take a deep breath.  Okay, you're not a smoker right?

PATIENT X341
No.

DOCTOR X341
They didn't do an x-ray of your chest when you went in no?

PATIENT X341
Oh they took many x-rays of my chest, I think before the operation.

DOCTOR X341
But not when you were just in the Emergency Room?

PATIENT X341
Oh no, no, they didn't take any.

DOCTOR X341
Okay let me actually take a look at your feet okay.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.

DOCTOR X341
@@@.

PATIENT X341
I took out those sides when my left arm was getting worse and worse so I'm just kind of living with it.  It's in my left arm right up in here.

DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
It bothers me when I'm at rest you know.

DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.  I'll take a look at it when I come back in okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:15  DOCTOR IN:  28:31)

DOCTOR X341
@@@.

PATIENT X341
How been doing there doc?

SECOND DOCTOR X341
I'm well and how are you?  We talked on the phone and DOCTOR told me that you get better but then bounce back.

PATIENT X341
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
@@@ that has been your chief problem.  Yeah these are pretty worn, I agree.  Yeah I think it's that gout's come back.  I was hoping to keep you off that prednisone but uh we were talking about that.  I think we're going to be putting you back on it uh, so this is going to be a little bit different however and DOCTOR is going to explain more but uh I do think that this is pretty much gout that's basically causing all these problems.  There are medicines that can help you keep gout flares, gouty flares away and hopefully you won't have to worry about this again but we have to try to go through this step by process.

PATIENT X341
Yeah and it goes with you all your life.  I never had gout since this operation you know eight weeks ago.  What the heck caused it though?

SECOND DOCTOR X341
You know sometimes it does happen where people are predisposed but have never had problems, then something happens, a stressful situation uh whatever that would be uh emotional stress, physical stress, surgery and it kind of flares up so that's a possibility.

PATIENT X341
And explain to me about the initial thing that happened over the last 24 hours, my ankle right here, oh my God, it's like walking on pins again.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
It was like when I those feet blown up real big before.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah I remember what they were before.

PATIENT X341
Yeah but this is in the ankle right here and it just happened though, it started last night in the evening.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Is that gout or?

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Well we think it's a combination of gout and fluid in the ankle.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Okay so DOCTOR is going to talk to you a little bit about a couple of medicines that we're going to be putting you on.  Uh you've been on them before albeit now that we kind of have a better idea of what we're dealing with I think we have a better direction of how we're going to handle these medicines so she's going to give you instructions on them.

PATIENT X341
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
I see and would you guys maybe follow up on it in a week and a half or so, I can call you.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Or you can give me a call cause I know it's like a month maybe if I see you in between, you know I'm just seeing you.  I mean I don't mind as long as it goes down.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Uh but it seems like you know they go down in the morning and then in the evening they swell up again.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Cause I'm just walking.  I'm walking daily but not that much at all.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
I understand.

PATIENT X341
I mean what does it take for these things to go away?

SECOND DOCTOR X341
We kind of.

PATIENT X341
I have a question like that you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Well gout is because you have too much of a substance in the body called uric acid, it's a natural substance and some people have more of it than others.  When you have too much of it it tends to crystallize out and it crystallizes out in your feet, especially in your toes and your ankles and that's why you get inflammation, swelling and pain.  So certain medicines can help drop that uric acid level and that's what DOCTOR is going to talk to you more about.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.  Alright and then other thing is my injections I used to take, the cortisone in my knee, this one here.  The cortisone they used @@@ cause it's new.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
But my old knee, I don't know who I talk to about that, Orthopedics or?

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Ortho yeah.

PATIENT X341
Yeah you do.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
I'd send you to @@@ Ortho.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Really.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
She will make a referral for you to see somebody.

PATIENT X341
Cause they used to give me injections three times a year and it helped me out walking.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Actually, yeah so the rheumatologist is who we're going to have you be seen for your gout and also help you with your knee.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Okay, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
But uh.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Next question.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah okay.  Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Alright.

PATIENT X341
Yeah this thing flared up because I was here just two days ago I was walking up and down the corridor, I went home and my feet and legs were very tired.  I put them up, it was overnight and this is when they started to get stiff and stiffness in the last 24 hours.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
I think we're to go ahead and give you some medicine and she'll talk to you @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
I have another question @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Well that's the thing; we probably would do it to keep it going.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Until we get the.

FIRST DOCTOR H44
Just a couple months.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
And even if you want to bring him back in a month or so.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
You know to check his uric acid and you could certainly test it in another month.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
In order to keep it simple and then @@@ and back next month.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
And then start the allopurinol?

SECOND DOCTOR X341
No I thought we'd go send him home with that since he's been.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Start right now.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Yeah have him start it in two weeks.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Check a uric acid level you know and @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
I think @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Okay, sounds good.

SECOND DOCTOR X341
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Okay thank you.  Alright so we're gonna make some changes to your medications okay.  I'm going to write it down for you so you don't get confused.

PATIENT X341
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Okay.  This is what we're gonna do, we're gonna stop the colchicine.

PATIENT X341
See this here, then my knee right now it feels stiff right in here.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Is that also affecting the @@@?

FIRST DOCTOR X341
No the gout's probably, I don't know if any.

PATIENT X341
Why is the knee getting stiff all of a sudden?

FIRST DOCTOR X341
I don't know.  Let's do one thing at once okay.

PATIENT X341
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Let's try to deal with this gout okay.  

PATIENT X341
I can do what they used to do.  I can still take a hot bath or something.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.  So the prednisone will probably help with your knee too okay.  And what we're going to do is we're going to, do you want pick it up today or do you want it to come in the mail?

PATIENT X341
Oh God, oh what time is it now, @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
It's 3:40.

PATIENT X341
Yeah, you called it what thing?

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Well you'd probably get them in a week yeah.

PATIENT X341
Well I thought they were open until around 4:30 or 5, like I say.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
So what do you think do you want to get it at the window?

PATIENT X341
Yeah I guess so.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Okay.

PATIENT X341
That's all I can do if I don't fall asleep, I'm so tired right now.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Got up this morning, running around before I come here, oh boy, I gave myself a little time you know but when you called and came back just sitting.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X341
It seems like I'm losing energy, I don't know why.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341
Cause when I get up, it's like there's a biochemistry that changed me since this operation.  And I had never been operated on in my whole life and never had anything cut open.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X341
My body's rejecting this cut open and this was like I didn't even know this was major surgery anyhow.

FIRST DOCTOR X341
Yeah.

PATIENT X341

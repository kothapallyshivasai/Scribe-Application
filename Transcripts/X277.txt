DOCTOR X277

PATIENT X277
Yes you did.

DOCTOR X277
You usually see DOCTOR right?

PATIENT X277
Yes and I saw you and I tried to change doctors and they wouldn't let me.  To you.

DOCTOR X277
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X277
Yeah.

DOCTOR X277
Oh you can't change now cause he's leaving.

PATIENT X277
Yeah that doesn't count.  So here's my question how long you gonna be around?  I hear you supposed to graduate.

DOCTOR X277
One year.

PATIENT X277
So after you graduated you gonna be around?

DOCTOR X277
Um I was thinking about working here permanently but my family's in California and we're having a baby so.

PATIENT X277
Congratulations.

DOCTOR X277
Thank you, thank you.  So.

PATIENT X277
So I'm gonna have to find you in California.

DOCTOR X277
You know you're more than welcome too.

PATIENT X277
You don't know me; I really will come to California okay.

DOCTOR X277
Let me finish filling out a couple of things here from my last patient and then we'll get talking.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
There are a couple of things that um we ordered for you so.

PATIENT X277
Yeah I haven't seen him for six months.

DOCTOR X277
Yeah he hadn't seen you in a while and now he's moving on I guess so okay, he's actually moving to St. xxx.

PATIENT X277
Hmm.

DOCTOR X277
I know I, okay.  I'm sorry I didn't recognize you initially.

PATIENT X277
Okay.  Its okay, hey I know you go through a lot of people.  Now there's another doctor here.  His name is oh God what did they say his name was DOCTOR something.

DOCTOR X277
DOCTOR?

PATIENT X277
DOCTOR right okay.  If you drop me, would you make sure I get him?

DOCTOR X277
Okay you probably won't.  Well he's my boss in this clinic.

PATIENT X277
Fantastic.  Try to go on to this you know.

DOCTOR X277
I guess it's finally making me do this, okay so what can I help you with today?

PATIENT X277
Okay.  I just came from Urology okay.

DOCTOR X277
Yeah.

PATIENT X277
She said that I need to talk to you.

DOCTOR X277
About?

PATIENT X277
I still have this congestion going on here.  Now I think I indicated to you the last time that I hadn't had this congestion until the pulled all my teeth out and one was really rough pulling that tooth out.  Uh did not give me the proper injection cause I felt it, I mean I was really in pain and I told them about that.  So now I have this constant drain.  I told you about that last time and you gave me something for it.

DOCTOR X277
Yeah, let's see what I gave you um.  What did I just give you; oh you were on Zyrtec before right, that's not new.

PATIENT X277
What's the Zyrtec for?

DOCTOR X277
Allergies and postnasal drip.

PATIENT X277
Oh okay, I think that's one of the ones I got mixed up, so start taking the Zyrtec.

DOCTOR X277
The Zyrtec.  Well I increased your blood pressure medicine last time.

PATIENT X277
Right.

DOCTOR X277
Remember you have high blood pressure.

PATIENT X277
That one too.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.

PATIENT X277
And I'd like to get that blood pressure without adding another.

DOCTOR X277
Okay, eventually.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Do you have a low salt diet?

PATIENT X277
Oh, I'll go to the low salt diet, whatever you tell me to do, I'm gonna do.

DOCTOR X277
Low salt diet.

PATIENT X277
Okay.  Cause I'm mainly in the 160 okay.  I got a 12-year-old so I want another few years.

DOCTOR X277
You don't look 61 okay.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
You can very well live longer.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Um the one thing though, you brought it up, I'm glad I see this now is um, oh okay I'll talk about that in a second.  Low salt diet.

PATIENT X277
You got it.

DOCTOR X277
Okay and no fried foods, once a week great you know.  

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Anything more than that, probably not a good idea.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
That's the best thing to do okay.  Okay so that's that.  Um you have high calcium okay.

PATIENT X277
Right.

DOCTOR X277
And people wonder what does that mean, well it can make you feel, it can sometimes prevent some of the symptoms of fatigue, feeling.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Kind of blah.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
They call it moans, stones and groans I think are the three things that's kind of alarming.

PATIENT X277
Hmm.

DOCTOR X277
Because you've got muscle aches and pains.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Cramps.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Fatigue and then kidney stones.

PATIENT X277
I had them oh how, oh God that was horrible.

DOCTOR X277
So then you ask why do you have high calcium levels.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Well it very well could be parathyroid.

PATIENT X277
Parathyroid, that's what they told me when they last seen me okay.

DOCTOR X277
So we need to check the um.

PATIENT X277
Calcium?

DOCTOR X277
Well we need to check the calcium and the urine.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
And I think he ordered that, did he or did you want me to order it.

PATIENT X277
He said that he was gonna order it, I went down and never received the bottle cause he wanted me to urinate in the bottle for 24 hours and then send it to the lab.

DOCTOR X277
Unfortunately that's the process.

PATIENT X277
Okay.  If you put in the consult I'll come back out on Monday and pick the bottle up. 

DOCTOR X277
I already ordered that so that's done okay.  Um and I think we need to take a look at this too.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Um, it would probably be better to get the labs first and then we can maybe take a look at this stuff.  Um so there's a couple, here's the thing.  So what you do about that oral surgery, if this is significant.  If these labs are concerning enough.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
And you are sent to Advocate Conflict.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
So I think this would qualify for surgery but I want to see the labs first.

PATIENT X277
Okay.  My understanding was they were going to try me on medicine first.

DOCTOR X277
We could try the medicine first.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
But let me see what the labs look like.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Because if it's really from the parathyroid you could do medicine but the gold standards of care is to remove them.

PATIENT X277
I don't like removing stuff.  I want to leave out of here with everything I came in with.

DOCTOR X277
Well let me see.

PATIENT X277
If we can get around it that's cool, if we can't then that could be a problem.

DOCTOR X277
Now how's your breathing?

PATIENT X277
That's what I have a problem with, especially during intercourse.  I mean I get shortness of breath.

DOCTOR X277
During intercourse you say?

PATIENT X277
Yes.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.

PATIENT X277
Or anytime I stress myself.  I used to walk quite a bit, I can't do that anymore.  I used to be able to run; I can't do that at all.

DOCTOR X277
And we never got a stress test on you did we?

PATIENT X277
A long time ago.  It's just like I inhale and it's like its tight right in here.  Feels like it's congestion up in here uh when I'm exerting myself even modestly okay and that's what concerned me so is it from the nasal drip, is it from my smoking from 30 years, I mean what kind of.  And they took x-rays, did that help them?

DOCTOR X277
Not really.  So, not very long.

PATIENT X277
So they took, checked an x-ray but they took it times four and they said it was all in my heart, they didn't get a good shot at so they wanted to give me.

DOCTOR X277
Yeah which is very possible so.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
I'm going to take a quick listen @@@.

PATIENT X277
It could be the what?

DOCTOR X277
It could be @@@.

PATIENT X277
Alright.

DOCTOR X277
So it's hard to say um.  He wants a repeat chest x-ray.

PATIENT X277
How often can I get these things?

DOCTOR X277
Well okay, you're just starting.  I mean we want to see your lungs okay.  I know you smoked for a while.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.  I haven't smoked in over 11-12 years.

DOCTOR X277
Okay but how many years did you smoke for?

PATIENT X277
Well probably a good part of 30, 25-30.

DOCTOR X277
That's a long time.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Even if you quit um.  There was no obvious thing on the x-ray that was concerning okay.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Um and you had a normal lung function tests.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Recently.

PATIENT X277
So have not found any ill-effect from the smoking?

DOCTOR X277
No there's no emphysema.

PATIENT X277
Okay, whew.

DOCTOR X277
No it was completely normal, that's 2010 a year ago.

PATIENT X277
Okay, so whatever this congestion is something else.

DOCTOR X277
It's something else. Um is it the heart, maybe okay.  Your echo that I ordered for you before is completely normal.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.  Um they're a little bit limited because I think the person who performed the test was not very skilled.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
So cause you know you deal with very obese people, it's hard to see the heart and you're right now very obese.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
So I might recommend a stress test actually.

PATIENT X277
Let's do it.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.

PATIENT X277
Here's another thing, it may be a minor concern or not.

DOCTOR X277
Oh actually you had it in July actually oh a year ago, it was normal.  Cause I thought you had one.  Did you have one?

PATIENT X277
Yeah, describe what a stress test is?

DOCTOR X277
You can do it any yeah, either they inject something into and you feel sick or they put you on a treadmill and make you walk.

PATIENT X277
That is the one I did.  Here's the thing I worked out and went a long time on the treadmill.  I remember that.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.

PATIENT X277
Uh I couldn't do even a third of that now, that's what I'm saying it's different.  Uh and my legs, my legs are weak, okay I'm stumbling and tripping a whole lot.  I almost, in fact this morning, I'm walking up the stairs, six flights of stairs and it's like my knee gave out.  It's like my muscles could not, actually going on.

DOCTOR X277
Did you have any knee arthritis?

PATIENT X277
No.

DOCTOR X277
You're on medicine for it though.

PATIENT X277
Arthritis?

DOCTOR X277
Yeah meloxicam, arthritis medicine.

PATIENT X277
Meloxicam, I remember the meloxicam but I thought that was something else.  You know at some point I'm going to need somebody to write down all the medicines I got and what they for.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.  Why don’t I, I will work on that okay.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
I'm extremely.

PATIENT X277
I know.

DOCTOR X277
I'm taking care of 12 people upstairs right now, opening the new hospital so, what I can do and I'll remind myself is to send you a letter with all the medicines down and what they're used for okay.

PATIENT X277
Alright.

DOCTOR X277
And then we'll decide which ones you really use and which ones you really want.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
And which ones are worthless.

PATIENT X277
Okay cause.

DOCTOR X277
Cause trying @@@.

PATIENT X277
Exactly.  I never liked taking medicines.

DOCTOR X277
@@@.  It's nothing new.  Your blood pressure cuff.

PATIENT X277
Yeah.

DOCTOR X277
That's necessary and let's no more salt and you lose a little weight okay.

PATIENT X277
I'm working on it.  As a matter of fact, that's what I was going to say that uh.

DOCTOR X277
Yeah.

PATIENT X277
My weight came down; it's down to 114 so I lost four pounds since I last came here.

DOCTOR X277
Actually were you using the program, the Telephone Program or no or am I thinking of somebody else?

PATIENT X277
What telephone, no, no, no.

DOCTOR X277
There's a telephone, okay that's something else.  I still hear that murmur.  They didn't detect it on that echo.

PATIENT X277
That's what it is about you.  You detected that murmur.

DOCTOR X277
I still hear it.

PATIENT X277
Nobody else has detected that.

DOCTOR X277
And with that echo no showing it, maybe I'm crazy but I swear there's a.

PATIENT X277
Well let's check into it, crazy or not.

DOCTOR X277
Yeah.  Deep breath in.

PATIENT X277
(Coughs)

DOCTOR X277
Oh, okay one more time, okay.

PATIENT X277
See I been doing that.

DOCTOR X277
Deep breath.  How long has this been going on?

PATIENT X277
Been going on a while.  Once I came here I started telling him I says.

DOCTOR X277
You don't have a blood clot history in your family do you?

PATIENT X277
Hmm, you know what yes.  My mother died a year or so ago from blood clots.

DOCTOR X277
Blood clots okay.

PATIENT X277
Yeah.

DOCTOR X277
Okay where were the blood clots?

PATIENT X277
Oh God, it went from her chest to her brain or something like that.

DOCTOR X277
Okay, let me see your chart for a second, have a seat and I want to talk to DOCTOR.  I know @@@.

PATIENT X277
No I mean really, I like you.  You're going somewhere I really want to.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.

PATIENT X277
Again.

DOCTOR X277
Hang on to that.

PATIENT X277
They have so many doctors and nurses here that.

DOCTOR X277
Alright.

PATIENT X277
That are not too friendly.

DOCTOR X277
Oh.  I @@@.

PATIENT X277
I know.

DOCTOR X277
Have a seat.

(DOCTOR OUT:  20:10  DOCTOR IN:  32:50)

DOCTOR X277
Alright.  Here's what we're gonna do.  I was talking with the other doctors okay.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
About how much to get excited about this cause you've had it, actually we were looking, you've had a very extensive work-up.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Heart, lungs, let's work on @@@.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Okay and the parathyroid and see if that helps.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Okay and then um we'll go from there okay.  I want you to use just the Claritin.  You're telling me it felt like a congestion type of thing.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.  Do that para thing?

DOCTOR X277
Yeah do you have @@@ symptoms too?

PATIENT X277
Yeah.

DOCTOR X277
Use this occasionally, we want to something for the nose also.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.  Let's try that.  So make sure you, I want to make sure you have renewals on that too.

PATIENT X277
Uh what I'm most concerned about is the breathing and the other item is the loss of muscle mass.  I mean I'm really losing muscle mass. 

DOCTOR X277
How are you @@@?  Are you lifting weights?

PATIENT X277
No I'm not doing anything.  I mean was really active about five years ago and.

DOCTOR X277
Oh okay.

PATIENT X277
And now @@@ so I'm not quite as active.

DOCTOR X277
@@@ okay, so it is a medical reason that you brought it up.

PATIENT X277
Well.

DOCTOR X277
So part of this, because you're not such a cardiac and there's that murmur.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Okay.  This may not um, let's see okay.

PATIENT X277
But yeah, try to make a change on that as they're sending it to Apartment 1A and it should be 11A, A11.

DOCTOR X277
Uh you know.

PATIENT X277
I understand.  You're busy; yeah I'll have them do it out there.

DOCTOR X277
I don't know how to do that.  So let's do that.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
And we'll do all the calcium stuff too, now DOCTOR ordered that okay.  Um I'm going to; those orders are still being assessed.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Uh let me if the orders are in.  And then I want to make sure you come see me okay.

PATIENT X277
And the muscle pain you were saying what?

DOCTOR X277
You're deconditioned.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
You need to be doing like actually sit-ups.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
It was interesting.  I thought it was very interesting, you know how it is interesting that this is very noticeable during intercourse.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
During intercourse you're using your core muscles.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.  So I need to work on my core.

DOCTOR X277
You've got to work on your core.

PATIENT X277
Is there someplace here I can do that?

DOCTOR X277
There is.  Have you been to the MOVE Program before?

PATIENT X277
No.

DOCTOR X277
You know it's an exercise program.

PATIENT X277
Works for me.

DOCTOR X277
Okay let's send you there okay.  You'll be happy with it okay.  And then this is the thing, this is why cause the other guy was supposed to come at 4:00 p.m., they overbooked me, he didn't show up.

PATIENT X277
Oh.

DOCTOR X277
He's in that program and apparently you have a work-out buddy and stuff and you keep track of your progress.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
And it's through the telephone.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
And it's sent through the VA and shows how you're doing.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
Let's do that okay.  Um.

PATIENT X277
MOVE Program.

DOCTOR X277
Let's send you over there uh.  And we need to watch that murmur okay.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277
I swear I hear something there.  If you do all these things.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
And you come back to me in a couple months.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
Then we know that may have caused that.  We're going to get the echo done again.

PATIENT X277
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X277
And I'll send you to Cardiology and they might do a cardiac test okay.

PATIENT X277
Okay.

DOCTOR X277

PATIENT X277

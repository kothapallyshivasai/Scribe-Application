DOCTOR X171
PATIENT?

PATIENT X171
Hmm.

DOCTOR X171
How you doing?

PATIENT X171
Good to see you.

DOCTOR X171
You too, how are you?

PATIENT X171
I'm fine and yourself?

DOCTOR X171
I'm alright.  Alright, so how have things been since I saw you last?

PATIENT X171
Oh, sucky.

DOCTOR X171
What's wrong?

PATIENT X171
Can't seem to get my blood down.

DOCTOR X171
Alright so how high have you been?

PATIENT X171
It's been uh, I think well I'm averaging lately about 244.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  You're taking metformin.

PATIENT X171
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X171
1000 mg twice a day.

PATIENT X171
Yep.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  And you're checking once a day now?

PATIENT X171
Uh yeah.  I'm going usually about uh once a day when I'm up in the 240+ range.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
And every other day when I'm closer to 2.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Now this seems uh you know, we don't have a hemoglobin A1c on you in a while.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
But um this seems higher than it was before.

PATIENT X171
Yeah but I got a lot of stress going on.

DOCTOR X171
A lot of stress.

PATIENT X171
A lot of stress.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Um are you eating differently?

PATIENT X171
Everything I can.

DOCTOR X171
You're eating a lot?

PATIENT X171
Well I'm eating small amounts throughout the day.

DOCTOR X171
Okay, like what kind of foods are we talking about here?

PATIENT X171
Uh what kind of foods.  Uh oatmeal in the morning.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Um no milk or sugar.  Um then a sandwich in the afternoon and then probably a larger meal around 4 o'clock and then a snack of some sort in the evening about 8 o'clock.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Are these things that have a lot of sugar in them, like cookies?

PATIENT X171
Of course.

DOCTOR X171
Okay and this is eating out of stress or what's going on?

PATIENT X171
Nervous eating I think.

DOCTOR X171
Nerves okay.

PATIENT X171
See I work out of my home so I have access to the refrigerator downstairs.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
That's a problem.  It was better when I was exercising, I mean when I was walking which I haven't been doing and I probably in all fairness will not do it as long as it's winter.

DOCTOR X171
Do you have any way to exercise in your home or do you belong to the gym?

PATIENT X171
No.

DOCTOR X171
Cause you've also gained some weight since the last time you were here.

PATIENT X171
Yeah I think I've gained a couple pounds.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.

PATIENT X171
And I feel it.

DOCTOR X171
Alright so we've got to get you on a different trajectory here.  Right now we're going in the wrong direction.

PATIENT X171
I am on a downhill slope.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.

PATIENT X171
And I feel it.

DOCTOR X171
So the stress, what are you doing to deal with the stress other than eating?

PATIENT X171
Oh not a thing.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
You know, I sleep about six hours a night and uh then I just get up and start doing what I got to do.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh, okay.  So walking, exercising does that help you feel better?

PATIENT X171
Evidently it does.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.  Yeah.

PATIENT X171
But.

DOCTOR X171
But you're not doing that.

PATIENT X171
I'm not doing that.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Alright cause that you know, that's one of the best ways, everything is going to be interrelated for you.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
So.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
If you can exercise well first of all you'll just feel better, your blood sugars will be better.  

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
You'll feel better overall and it helps a lot of people deal with stress to exercise like that.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
@@@.  Every time I start talking I start coughing alright but in the meantime, I mean we'll check your hemoglobin A1c again today and see what your average blood sugars have been for the last three months.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Um and um but we should make some changes to your medications to manage your blood sugars in the meantime okay.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
And what can you do to change your eating?  Would you like to see the nutritionist?

PATIENT X171
I've seen the nutritionist.

DOCTOR X171
So you know what's in your food.

PATIENT X171
I do yeah.

DOCTOR X171
You look at nutrition labels?

PATIENT X171
Uh no I don't you know. Um I'm the type of person who will make a bowl of spaghetti and eats the leftovers the next day, whatever is left in the frig.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
I'll eat while I'm working.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
So.

DOCTOR X171
Can we change that?

PATIENT X171
Change that?  We can do anything.

DOCTOR X171
Right.  I mean what I would do is try to I mean you can do something like keeping a log of what you're eating.

PATIENT X171
On my intake?

DOCTOR X171
Yeah just to make yourself a little more cognitive of what you're eating.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
And if you're holding yourself accountable in that way some people find it's easier to say well maybe I don't really need these cookies considering I've already eaten some spaghetti and some you know had some juice and whatever else.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
Um today so you know and then you'll see the correlation between days where eating more sugar with your blood sugars getting worse.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
So that's, that's maybe one idea we can use to, to eat a little bit less hopefully um.

PATIENT X171
And exercise more.

DOCTOR X171
Yes

PATIENT X171
See these are things I know I'm supposed to be doing.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah I know, maybe reminding you of all of these things.  I'm going to get this page, give me one moment.

PATIENT X171
Alright, alright.

DOCTOR X171
(Doctor answers page)  Um otherwise any problems like fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation?

PATIENT X171
Hmm, um I've had an upset stomach for a while.

DOCTOR X171
How long? Like months? Years?

PATIENT X171
Ah a couple weeks.

DOCTOR X171
Weeks okay.

PATIENT X171
Couple.

DOCTOR X171
Uh and what do you mean by upset stomach?

PATIENT X171
Oh just a little uh, maybe it's more like a nervous stomach you know.

DOCTOR X171
Okay like what do you feel or what happens?  Is it um feeling like heartburn, indigestion?

PATIENT X171
Well yeah.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.

PATIENT X171
More like a heartburn, an acid reflux or something yeah.

DOCTOR X171
Is it worse at night when you lay down?

PATIENT X171
No, no.

DOCTOR X171
What times do you?

PATIENT X171
Usually about midday.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Okay and have you tried anything for that?

PATIENT X171
Um I may have a glass of milk.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  So are you eating to try and uh.

PATIENT X171
Sometimes yeah.

DOCTOR X171
Alleviate some of the discomfort in your stomach okay.  Alright.  Well we kind of, I think it sounds like maybe you've got some acid reflux.  It can go on with stress, that's another thing that can go along with stress.  So we kind of have two options for treating that or to see if they help you.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
And the first one would be to take something as needed like Tums or something like that.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
Have you tried that at all?

PATIENT X171
Well sometimes that helps.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
And I haven't, it hasn't gotten to the point where I need Tums.

DOCTOR X171
Okay, but you eat instead.

PATIENT X171
Yeah, I would rather have a sandwich than a Tums.

DOCTOR X171
Alright maybe what we could do instead is try um something that you take every day.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
It takes a few weeks to build up in your system and then um and it'll work on suppressing the amount of acid in your stomach, decreasing the amount of irritation you have in your stomach and your esophagus.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
And then hopefully things will get, you know it'll prevent that feeling from coming on at all.

PATIENT X171
Actually coming here motivates me.  

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Not so much seeing you, although I enjoy seeing you.  It's because I see the other veterans and their condition and I don't want to get to that point.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Okay, so that's kind of a motivating factor.

DOCTOR X171
Yep and it's, that's just fine.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
That's you know.

PATIENT X171
So.

DOCTOR X171
I want this, the goal in this clinic is to help you take care of yourself and prevent you from developing a lot of complications.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
That happens to a lot of these vets okay.  Alright now this, if you ever get pain in your stomach.

PATIENT X171
No.

DOCTOR X171
Or is it like a nausea feeling that you get or?

PATIENT X171
It's more of a heartburn.

DOCTOR X171
Heartburn okay.  Cause if you ever develop pain in your stomach.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
That's relieved by eating.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
That's something we should talk about cause that can be a sign of an ulcer.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Alright and uh if you have an ulcer we should have you see a gastroenterologist and get that addressed okay.  Now last time you were here or back in February.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
We checked your cholesterol levels and they were kind of borderline.  For someone with diabetes they were you know we have a really strict idea of what we want your cholesterol level to be.  Yours were like at the borderline and we didn't feel like we needed to start a medication for them.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Then because um you were doing a good job as far as your diet and exercise.  Now I would anticipate that these are going to be worse if we were to check them again today.

PATIENT X171
Yeah what was my cholesterol?

DOCTOR X171
Last time you were here your total cholesterol was 142.  The most important number that we look at is your bad cholesterol, your LDL which was 82.

PATIENT X171
Oh.

DOCTOR X171
Now for your average person that would be a great number but for a diabetic we want them to be under 70.  We want to see 70 or less.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Alright. 

PATIENT X171
So would think that my LDL would be higher than 82.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.  Based on what you're telling me about your diet and not exercising both of them really help it.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
So I think we should check it again.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
If they are significantly higher I think we should start a medication to treat your cholesterol and bring it down.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Um once we get a handle on everything else.

PATIENT X171
Fine.

DOCTOR X171
Okay now have you eaten yet today?

PATIENT X171
I have.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
I had a bowl of oatmeal.

DOCTOR X171
Would it be possible for you to come back another time on an empty stomach and get blood drawn?

PATIENT X171
Uh well I can always come back.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.  Okay cause we have to do these labs the first thing in the morning, have you fast for 12 hours.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
And then get the blood drawn.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Um and what else.  I think that's pretty much all you're due for.  Your blood pressure looks great today.  Um you saw the ophthalmologist, they didn't see any problems.

PATIENT X171
I see him again today.

DOCTOR X171
Okay good, good um.  No signs of kidney problems related to the diabetes.

PATIENT X171
No.

DOCTOR X171
And you've been seeing the podiatrist.

PATIENT X171
Now remember I had the kidney stone removed in January.

DOCTOR X171
Are you still seeing a urologist?

PATIENT X171
Um no but I am on a medication um and I brought the bottle but I forgot to bring it up.

DOCTOR X171
Oh okay.

PATIENT X171
Yeah.

DOCTOR X171
Um cause right now all I have as far as the medications that you're taking is the metformin and then we're ordering your test strips through here.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
And you're on something for your prostate?

PATIENT X171
Uh with the doctor that I was seeing yeah.

DOCTOR X171
Okay so you're not seeing him anymore?

PATIENT X171
No I'm not scheduled till later in the year.

DOCTOR X171
Oh okay.  Is it like something to shrink your prostate cause yours was enlarged?

PATIENT X171
Yes he thought it was larger than normal.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
And I just told him I just had a large prostate.

DOCTOR X171
But you did, okay.  Um is it like Flomax or?

PATIENT X171
No.

DOCTOR X171
Um uh, I forget the brand names um like finasteride.

PATIENT X171
No, starts with an O I think.

DOCTOR X171
Starts with an O?  Hmm.

PATIENT X171
Well.

DOCTOR X171
Your PSA, I know we talked about this before.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
Your PSA was high when we took it this year.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
And you said it's been high in the past.

PATIENT X171
Yes.

DOCTOR X171
Have you ever had a biopsy of your prostate?

PATIENT X171
I have, I did not like it.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.  Alright so can we get, I really like to get reports from your urologist of whatever they found.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Or whatever evidence they have that this is you know that there's no prostate cancer cause that's what the elevated PSA is suggestive of.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
@@@.

PATIENT X171
They don't think I ever had seizures.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
So that I don't have to uh have problems down the road.

DOCTOR X171
Right um so that, if they could just send us whatever like biopsy results they have or anything, just so we can have it on our record and we can stop asking you about it.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Um I can give you our fax number here and they can go ahead and fax it to me.  That way you don't have to @@@.

PATIENT X171
Well actually the only person I explain this to is you so.

DOCTOR X171
Alright then it'll make me feel better.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
Um okay so our fax number here is 708-202-7359.  So why don't you have a seat up here.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Take a deep breath for me.  Okay open your mouth ah.  No chest pain ever or shortness of breath?

PATIENT X171
Oh the shortness of breath?

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.

PATIENT X171
Yeah.

DOCTOR X171
When does that happen?

PATIENT X171
Oh I think if I bend over too long.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Um does it happen like when you're walking?

PATIENT X171
No.

DOCTOR X171
Climbing a flight of stairs?

PATIENT X171

DOCTOR X171

DOCTOR X171
Just when you bend over?

Alright take a deep breath in and out.  Any pain in your belly here?

PATIENT X171

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  You get any swelling in your legs ever?

PATIENT X171
No um oh yeah sometimes I have socks that are tight around the.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Top and they leave a mark and it goes away.

DOCTOR X171
It looks like you might have a little bit of swelling in your legs.

PATIENT X171
Well you know, as I told you previously and you probably don't recall it is I do have cases of gout.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Sometimes it comes and goes or I really don't know what gout is but when it becomes inflamed I can tell a couple days before it starts.

DOCTOR X171
And where do you get that?  What joints?

PATIENT X171
Uh either the knees.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Or the ankles.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  So you've never been given any medications for.

PATIENT X171
No.

DOCTOR X171
To prevent it from happening.  Do you get medication when you have a flare?

PATIENT X171
Uh no.  I'll take uh Tylenol.

DOCTOR X171
Okay and how long does it take for it to go way usually?

PATIENT X171
When I feel an onset?

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Uh I start taking Tylenol two tablets three times a day.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
And it'll prevent it from getting becoming a problem.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
And it'll be around for three days and then it'll stop.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Do they get real red and inflamed?

PATIENT X171
No I can just feel it.  I can feel it's tender sometimes.

DOCTOR X171
Okay you can come back and have a seat.  Alright so we have.

PATIENT X171
But I believe that's my diet also.

DOCTOR X171
Okay, eating a lot of red meat and things like that?

PATIENT X171
Cause I think it's.

DOCTOR X171
Does red meat trigger it or alcohol?

PATIENT X171
It's probably more of alcohol.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Because I really do not drink a lot but when I do because it's hot and you know or there's some sort of event, it'll come down the road a few days later.

DOCTOR X171
You're not a smoker are you?

PATIENT X171
No.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
Not any longer.

DOCTOR X171
How long ago did you quit?

PATIENT X171
Uh about 28 years ago, 23, 25, somewhere around there.  You know some people just know the date and time.  I just noticed I wasn't smoking so.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Alright I'm going to step out for one minute I'll be right back.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  47:43  DOCTOR IN:  61:54)

DOCTOR X171
@@@.

PATIENT X171
@@@ right now.

DOCTOR X171
Alright so what we're going to do.  I think we can wait on getting your uh cholesterol checked for the time being.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Um but I would like to check your hemoglobin A1c and your kidney function and stuff today.  So if you can stay and get some labs today we'll take care of that.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
Um and we can add another medication for your diabetes to try and get that under control.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
Um you know in dealing with whatever this stress is that you have in your life is going to be key.  It's going to be key in controlling your blood sugar.

PATIENT X171
Exactly.

DOCTOR X171
Your weight and everything.  Is there anything that you can do about that?  I mean you said you're working from home.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
Um and is it just trying to get the work done or is it dealing with colleagues or?

PATIENT X171
No I have um; I deal in the foreclosure market.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Um you know doing short sales and helping businesses and homeowners uh keep their businesses going.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.

PATIENT X171
So um it's a financial stress.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.

PATIENT X171
You know we're not always successful.

DOCTOR X171
Right.

PATIENT X171
So.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X171
It's just the nature of the job.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.  Is there a lot of anxiety that you're feeling related to it?

PATIENT X171
No I think it's more a frustration.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.

PATIENT X171
Yeah.

DOCTOR X171
Alright.  Alright, do you think talking with someone would help you deal with it?

PATIENT X171
No because uh I've been doing this for a long time.  I pretty much uh understand that you know there's a lot items out of my control.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
So.

DOCTOR X171
Alright.  But it's still affecting your.

PATIENT X171
Well it affects me because its, you know I'm still dealing with people and you know what's going on in their lives.

DOCTOR X171
Right, right, right.

PATIENT X171
So.

DOCTOR X171
Hmm.

PATIENT X171
I was listening to the radio coming in and uh they said that the poverty levels in the suburbs have gone up.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
And um you know I think @@@ poverty has gone up in the suburbs 70%, in xxx 120%, @@@ where I live is 500%.  

DOCTOR X171
Wow.

PATIENT X171
So there's a lot of it going on and you know I'm trying to help people keep their houses.

DOCTOR X171
@@@.

PATIENT X171
Or move on to the next.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Situation.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.  As cleanly as possible.

PATIENT X171
That's just you know the price of business.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah.

PATIENT X171
If I didn't care I wouldn't have the stress.

DOCTOR X171
Yes.  Yeah but I don't want this to have such a large negative impact on your health.

PATIENT X171
Well I just think it's, I just think as the economy gets worse, which it will continue to do, there's just going to be more of it.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Fortunately I can only do so much.

DOCTOR X171
Right.

PATIENT X171
So.

DOCTOR X171
Alright well I don't want this to keep you.

PATIENT X171
No.  I'll just go home and drink.

DOCTOR X171
That's really true but this can be just as bad like when we talk about you, you see some of the veterans here who.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah and so it's, we don't want what's happening now affect you much further down the road.

PATIENT X171
Right.

DOCTOR X171
Alright cause.

PATIENT X171
But if you give you an assignment of monitoring my intake.

DOCTOR X171
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X171
Uh I'll do that.

DOCTOR X171
Okay, alright and we'll see how it goes and we're going to start this new medication.  Do you want to pick it up at the Pharmacy or have them mailed to you?

PATIENT X171
Oh just have it mailed to me.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  So.

PATIENT X171
What is it?

DOCTOR X171
Um glipizide is the name of it.  It's another oral medication that is going to work in a slightly different way.

PATIENT X171
Is it in replace of or in addition to?

DOCTOR X171
No in addition to.

PATIENT X171
Okay are there any side effects?

DOCTOR X171
Well the one thing that can.

PATIENT X171
Will it make me sexy or something?

DOCTOR X171
It can make your blood sugar drop low.  Unlike metformin, it's very rare with metformin to have a low blood sugar because it works in a different way but this medication is going to increase your own secretion of insulin and so sometimes the side effect can be low blood sugars.  We're starting you on a dose that probably won't have that affect given what your blood sugars are.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
But I would like to um you know, I'd like you to keep checking just like you are.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
And every once in a while.  Are these mostly fasting blood sugars in the morning that you're checking or are they during the day?

PATIENT X171
Usually in the morning.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah so let's try checking maybe one day a week check a blood sugar before dinnertime.

PATIENT X171
Okay.

DOCTOR X171
And see where things are there, at that time of day, so we know what your fluctuation is okay.  And today we'll do, we'll just check a couple labs.  Um and give us a call, maybe in a month and if you can give us a call and just tell us how your blood sugars are doing.

PATIENT X171
Alright.  Who do I call?

DOCTOR X171
I have a number here.  Um you can call, I'll have you call the nursing like hot line and then they'll send the message along to me.  So the phone number is 708-282-3800.  Oh and the last thing I wanted to do, just for your stomach in the meantime.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
Is give you that medication we were talking about, it's called omeprazole and I'll have you take it for a month.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
And then you can stop.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
It will work to decrease the acid secretion in your stomach.  Hopefully you won't be eating to try and you know.

PATIENT X171
Help me give it up.

DOCTOR X171
Yeah I mean what you're trying to do is neutralize that acid.

PATIENT X171
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X171
And create a barrier to protect your stomach.  That's why, especially milk, things like that are counteracting the acid so, so do it for a month and see if that helps.

PATIENT X171
Okay.  That's not something I would have to stay on?

DOCTOR X171
No.  Hopefully after a month it gives your stomach some time to heal.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
And then most people are able to stop.  If it does persist then that's a sign that something a little bit more worrisome is going on and we'll have you checked out by the gastroenterologist okay.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
Alright so.  I want you to come back and see me in three months.  We'll get the hemoglobin A1c.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
And check the electrolytes today.  Um and have you give us a call in about a month and let me know how your blood sugars are doing.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
And if you're getting low blood sugars give a call too.

PATIENT X171
And where do I go again for the?

DOCTOR X171
We'll see if they can get you in out here.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
You know it looks like she's not here, so we'll have you go down to the Lab to have your labs drawn.

PATIENT X171
Alright

DOCTOR X171
Alright so I'll give you this and you can turn that in at the front and you'll head down to the first floor for blood work.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
Okay.  I won't shake your hand.

PATIENT X171
Alright.

DOCTOR X171
I'll give you a call if there are any problems with the labs.

PATIENT X171
Okay.  Thank you.

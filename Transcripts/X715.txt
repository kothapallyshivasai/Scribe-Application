DOCTOR X715

PATIENT X715

DOCTOR X715
I'm good thank you.  Go ahead and have a seat.  

PATIENT X715
I just called on Monday so I'm glad to, so I got to see you in two days.

DOCTOR X715
Alright.  Um so @@@ that you wanted to come for a visit.

PATIENT X715
I got a wart.

DOCTOR X715
You got a wart okay.

PATIENT X715
And they said I need a referral to go to Dermatology.

DOCTOR X715
Dermatology.  Okay yeah and they'll freeze it.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
Do you get warts often or?

PATIENT X715
No that's the first one in, since I was.

DOCTOR X715
Little?

PATIENT X715
Yeah.

DOCTOR X715
A Dermatology referral.

PATIENT X715
And two other follow up and also because you work with doctor.

DOCTOR X715
Right.  Dermatology referral.

PATIENT X715
That's the name.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah and they'll contact you and you can do that, I'll put it in there.  @@@.  Is it painful?

PATIENT X715
Uh sometimes because it'll, but now it's all flat.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
But sometimes it'll kind of pop up you know like a mushroom and it'll get caught on thread or string or whatever.

DOCTOR X715
Oh okay.  Does it ever bleed?

PATIENT X715
Um yes.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  When did it first appear?

PATIENT X715
Uh probably a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR X715
Wow, it's been there that long.

PATIENT X715
Yeah.  Actually they hit it once before with this nitrogen, whatever.

DOCTOR X715
Okay so that's okay and it came back.

PATIENT X715
Yes they thought you know it was really gone completely.  I should have, in fact that's what I'd like to do this time.

DOCTOR X715
Alright.

PATIENT X715
If they can hit it and then I would come back in like a month and don't wait that long.

DOCTOR X715
Well, they'll tell you what they think and if you need to come back you know later.  Okay so um your blood pressure was a little bit high last time but today actually it was normal okay.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
So have you been on a low salt diet or have you been eating less, @@@ or you don't know.

PATIENT X715
No honestly I really didn't change anything.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
I know that it was.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah I guess it fluctuates your blood pressure sometimes.  

PATIENT X715
It does but the last time I came in it was high.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah.

PATIENT X715
It was I must have been @@@.

DOCTOR X715
Well we'll keep monitoring.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
And @@@.  No need to start you on medications but I still recommend exercise you know uh and you know a sensible diet, low salt, low cholesterol.

PATIENT X715
Right.  Um you're gonna tell me not to eat cheeseburgers and.

DOCTOR X715
Well I'm also gonna say not do something @@@.

PATIENT X715
I don't know about that.

DOCTOR X715
Once in a while you can.

PATIENT X715
I know right.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah.  But you know portion control I think is the main thing.  Alright um how's the acid reflux?

PATIENT X715
Fine.

DOCTOR X715
Okay you're taking the medicine?

PATIENT X715
Yes.

DOCTOR X715
Good.

PATIENT X715
Every day.

DOCTOR X715
Good.

PATIENT X715
Once in a while I forget and I can tell.

DOCTOR X715
Oh really.

PATIENT X715
Later on that day I'll feel it more so the medicine definitely works.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  And your cholesterol was done in March um.

PATIENT X715
I think the triglycerides were a little bit high.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah and uh you were going to take some over-the-counter fish oil.

PATIENT X715
I do.

DOCTOR X715
You do?

PATIENT X715
I have for years.

DOCTOR X715
Oh yes.

PATIENT X715
I take fish oil, flax seed and primrose.

DOCTOR X715
So keep doing that.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
And uh definitely limit the fat in your diet.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
And we'll check it next year in March.  Oh this was March @@@ oh we'll check it @@@.

PATIENT X715
Okay.

DOCTOR X715
Um or the end of this year.  How's the headaches, have you been having them lately at night?

PATIENT X715
Yes it's been better yeah.

DOCTOR X715
Good.

PATIENT X715
And that was like it was the same time that the blood pressure was up so I went through a month, before I came on that last visit, I had headaches every day and I believe it was related to that but you know once in a while.  You know what I think I have borderline apnea because.

DOCTOR X715
Sleep apnea.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
Have you ever taken a sleep test?  So why do you think?

PATIENT X715
Because the headache is, I mean a symptom of you know carbon dioxide so there's times where I'll wake up and I'll be so, so you know heavy, you know sleepy and that's when I have the headache so I always, I can't prove it.

DOCTOR X715
Right, right.

PATIENT X715
It's just how I feel when I wake up.

DOCTOR X715
Do you snore?

PATIENT X715
Oh I don't know.

DOCTOR X715
Okay uh do you ever wake up like gasping for air or anything?

PATIENT X715
No.

DOCTOR X715
Can you open your mouth and say ah?

PATIENT X715
Ah.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  If it keeps happening let me know okay.

PATIENT X715
Hmm.

DOCTOR X715
Well sometimes you know people can kind of @@@ and if you do have sleep apnea and the way to find that out is to do a sleep test.  

PATIENT X715
Well, let me tell you about, that was the next thing I was gonna follow up is that probably for ten years.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
Or more, a little more, I once in a while, you know depending on what I'm eating.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
You know it'll kind of get stuck and most of the time I can drink anything and push it out of the way.  Two years ago as I was eating chicken at lunch and it got stuck and I had to go to the ER where they knocked me out to get that.

DOCTOR X715
Oh the chicken bone or?

PATIENT X715
No, meat but they said that well you know it doesn't matter.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
They said well they see a lot of this it's because chicken is relatively dry.

DOCTOR X715
Hmm.  Had that ever happened to you?

PATIENT X715
No.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
But um I'm more mindful of you know eating so I drink regularly while eating.  Um and I don't know if this is related to that but one other thing is once in a while I would get a little uh piece of food stuck in the back of my throat.  Kind of what you just did but if it's right back there I can see it so I would like stick a straw back there and kind of knock it out of the way and it usually sinks in okay, I know about that.  But in the last six months say, even today right now, I can feel there's just like a little bit of you know, there's something right below there.

DOCTOR X715
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X715
I know you're.

DOCTOR X715
Do you ever like food gets stuck in your throat?

PATIENT X715
It doesn't get stuck where it won't pass.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.  So you feel like it's kind of hard to swallow?

PATIENT X715
No I feel like, you know I'm just sitting here you know I'm not eating and I kind of move my throat around it feels like there's a little you know food or something.

DOCTOR X715
Right, kind of staying, staying in there.

PATIENT X715
Stuck, yes.

DOCTOR X715
Hmm.

PATIENT X715
And I brush and floss you know twice a day.  I gargle probably six times a day and I make sure you know it gets all the way back there and clean it out but that's kind of a newer thing so I would.

DOCTOR X715
When did this start, the sensation of that?

PATIENT X715
Definitely more often in the last year.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
I'm more aware of it.

DOCTOR X715
Okay, okay and you never had a study or anything done right?

PATIENT X715
No.

DOCTOR X715
Okay are you a smoker?

PATIENT X715
No.

DOCTOR X715
Have you ever smoked before?

PATIENT X715
Yeah but just for a short time when I was in my 20s.

DOCTOR X715
How long?

PATIENT X715
Uh two years.

DOCTOR X715
Oh okay.  How about alcohol?

PATIENT X715
Rarely.

DOCTOR X715
Rarely okay any.

PATIENT X715
Drugs.

DOCTOR X715
Drugs or anything.

PATIENT X715
No.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
I'm too healthy to have any major problems.

DOCTOR X715
That's good, that's great okay.  Um hmm, so I mean sometimes people have a little bit of stricture here where you know eating something and it can get stuck and um it is possible but then you're having this on and off right?  It's not happening all the time?

PATIENT X715
Uh well maybe because I'm more aware of it now.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X715
But.

DOCTOR X715
Alright uh I mean I could have you see you know the GI doctors to see if you have something in your esophagus or your throat.

PATIENT X715
And do they have something where they could put like a camera back there?

DOCTOR X715
Yeah.

PATIENT X715
They do.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah and see if they have anything that might help you.

PATIENT X715
Why don't we do that?

DOCTOR X715
So um we'll probably start like an x-ray.

PATIENT X715
Hmm.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah have you drink something and see what's going on in there okay.

PATIENT X715
Yeah.

DOCTOR X715
So yeah we'll do that um and you need a colonoscopy um so do you want to schedule that?

PATIENT X715
You know that I'm not real crazy about it but go ahead and tell me why I should have it.

DOCTOR X715
Alright so colonoscopy.

PATIENT X715
I know what it is.

DOCTOR X715
It is, it is the purpose of it.

PATIENT X715
Is to look for polyps, the cancer.

DOCTOR X715
Colon cancer.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
And the reason is colon cancer once you have it is a very deadly disease.  Um I've seen many people; once they get diagnosed they don't have that many years.

PATIENT X715
Okay.  You're not.

DOCTOR X715
But it's a very preventable.

PATIENT X715
Curable, preventable.

DOCTOR X715
It's not curable once you find it but preventable.  So that's what a colonoscopy is for.  You find a polyp, they're not cancer yet, you remove them and you're cancer free but if you don’t look for them and then later on.

PATIENT X715
They're cancer.

DOCTOR X715
They find you with cancer then there is only so much you can do.  So that's why screening is important.  Um so what you do is what @@@ basically they put a camera through your rectum, go through all the length of your colon, look for any kind of polyps or any tumors.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
The hardest thing is the night, the day before, you have to drink, fasting is only one part.

PATIENT X715
I know.

DOCTOR X715
You have to drink this thing called Go-LYTELY, probably about half a gallon I think and then it'll just make you run all morning yeah, so it'll clean your colon so that the doctor, you know the GI doctors will be able to visualize everything.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
So that's the right thing really, you know.  You have to make sure that you're very close to the bathroom and um yeah @@@.  Um that's pretty much it yeah and then once they find something they'll remove it.

PATIENT X715
They ain't gonna find no tumor.

DOCTOR X715
If they don't find anything then you don't have to take the test for another ten years.  What else do you want to know?

PATIENT X715
I'm aware of the procedure.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
The only reason that I'm reticent is because I've also heard, I believe you because you're a professional but I've also heard that the studies are not always.

DOCTOR X715
100% accurate.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
It's pretty good though.  Nothing's 100%.

PATIENT X715
Right, I know.

DOCTOR X715
Oh but.

PATIENT X715
But it definitely outweighs, the good outweighs the bad.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah I mean I've seen very sad results on people with colon cancer so that's why I recommend it and it's totally up to you um but I just don't want you to go through all the things that you, @@@ fully understood @@@.

PATIENT X715
Well the uh, what's the other um, there's a gland or something.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
That men have.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh prostate.

PATIENT X715
Yeah the prostate.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
Maybe I'm confusing the two things.  Is the prostate exam the same as this?

DOCTOR X715
No.  Prostate exam is just kind of like a rectal exam.  Have you ever had a rectal exam?

PATIENT X715
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X715
So basically.

PATIENT X715
I mean just kind of feels around.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah, yeah you feel around the rectum and the prostate's very close to the rectum.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
And you feel for any nodules.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT X715
So that's a different procedure than the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR X715
Oh yeah the colonoscopy is actually a much more complicated procedure.  They will sedate you.  There's a camera that goes in all the way.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
To your colon.

PATIENT X715
Am I conscious?

DOCTOR X715
You're probably not gonna be conscious you know.  I've heard some patients say that the anesthesiologist didn't give them enough sedation and they kind of woke up which is kind of a bad experience for them.  But usually they give you sedation, they say count back from three to one and you fall asleep.

PATIENT X715
You know what, when I had this thing.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
They said that and they said you're gonna be conscious but you won't be able to do anything.  That wasn't true, I counted back and the next thing I knew they're waking me up.  I was out when they were doing.

DOCTOR X715
What?

PATIENT X715
That sounds like what I had the throat blockage, two years ago the chicken thing.

DOCTOR X715
Oh okay.

PATIENT X715
I was definitely knocked out so.  I was happy about that.

DOCTOR X715
Yep, yeah.  The procedure itself is, yeah you're gonna be asleep so I think the hard part is the night before.

PATIENT X715
The day, it's a day right, you can't you have to pass.

DOCTOR X715
Yes.

PATIENT X715
A day.

DOCTOR X715
Exactly, starting in the morning you start drinking.  Yeah that has to start early so then you can actually sleep at night and you don't have to run.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
Yes.  So why don't we schedule you for that.  Um, what about the flu shot?

PATIENT X715
Don't want it.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  Did you get a bad reaction from it before?

PATIENT X715
In recent years I had to get shots, I was in the guard, the military 2007 so um that was more shots I think that I had in my life.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
And um I'm.

DOCTOR X715
Just be careful okay.  You know stay away from sick people.  I can't really, I usually recommend a flu shot but you know, if you don't want it that's fine.  Um I mean it's not fine but you have you know increased @@@.  Um is said you had the tetanus shot, do you remember when?

PATIENT X715
No not exactly but it was sometime.

DOCTOR X715
Just give approximate, maybe four years ago?

PATIENT X715
Uh no, definitely before 06 so probably between 03 and 06.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  The tetanus you get it every ten years.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
So you'll probably need it in 2013 then okay.  Um alright and that's good.

PATIENT X715
I need to share one thing with you.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah.

PATIENT X715
What's the stuff that they uh, can't think of the name of it, it's a chemical cousin to what is in anti-freeze used in a car.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
The.

DOCTOR X715
@@@.

PATIENT X715
No the stuff that makes you go.

DOCTOR X715
Oh.

PATIENT X715
But they sell it over-the-counter.

DOCTOR X715
MiraLAX.

PATIENT X715
Yeah MiraLAX whatever and I bought that.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
Let's say like in the last three months and I didn't even, I didn't drink the whole thing or all day like this would be but I took double dose.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  MiraLAX.

PATIENT X715
And it didn't do anything; I mean not even a movement.

DOCTOR X715
You're having constipation right?

PATIENT X715
Well I'm not totally you know but that way but it's not moving like it should and I take psyllium and fruit you know.  I have at least a medium amount of fiber daily.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh and then you also tried some MiraLAX and it didn't work.

PATIENT X715
Yeah.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
Yes.

DOCTOR X715
How often do you go?

PATIENT X715
Well once a day in the morning.

DOCTOR X715
Okay so you do go daily.

PATIENT X715
Right but it seems to me that what is you know by taking psyllium, in addition to if I'm eating beans and spinach and other things that are you know real high fiber then that should just fly out but there like today it was.

DOCTOR X715
Do you have to strain a lot?

PATIENT X715
I mean not a lot.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
But off and on.

DOCTOR X715
Is like your stool very hard?

PATIENT X715
When it's like that it is.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  Do you drink enough water?

PATIENT X715
Yeah.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  Have you tried like Colace?

PATIENT X715
What?

DOCTOR X715
Colace, something that softens your stools.

PATIENT X715
I don't know.

DOCTOR X715
Would you like to give that a try?

PATIENT X715
Yeah.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
Oh the newest one that I tried is um, it begins with an S.

DOCTOR X715
Senna.

PATIENT X715
Yes.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah.

PATIENT X715
And that.

DOCTOR X715
That's a different kind yeah.

PATIENT X715
Right.

DOCTOR X715
So I'm gonna give you a stool softener which will make your stools soft so.

PATIENT X715
That's different from Ex-Lax?

DOCTOR X715
Yes so the other ones are kind of like.

PATIENT X715
Oh.

DOCTOR X715
Um.

PATIENT X715
@@@.

DOCTOR X715
Uh they kind of like stimulate your intestines to make them move to let you go.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
This one it softens up your stool so you don't have to strain @@@.  It looks like you're taking the other stuff.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
So why don't we um try this one since this acts in a different way and you can take it daily um and if it's still not working then you can take it twice a day okay.

PATIENT X715
Hmm, I appreciate that.  Cause I told the doc, I told DOCTOR that.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
And he kind of blew me off; I don't want to tell you.

DOCTOR X715
Yeah the only reason he said that is because he didn't see the other problems around it.  Did you want to pick it up or do you want it to be mailed?

PATIENT X715
Uh pick it up today?

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.  Do you want to pick it up today?

PATIENT X715
Uh how does that work over there?

DOCTOR X715
You wait at the Pharmacy and you pick it up.  Either that or um they would mail it to you and you know you can pick it up.  Do you want to pick it up?

PATIENT X715
Let me pick it up because I got to go do the breathing test anyway so that'll give me time to go through the system.

DOCTOR X715
Alright.  And um.

PATIENT X715
Years ago you know I ate a lot of fruit but used to be if I took prune juice guaranteed, an hour later, it would just fly out.

DOCTOR X715
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X715
And that doesn't work anymore.  I'll take both prune juice and prunes and nothing.

DOCTOR X715
Oh, do you also take verapamil for your blood pressure?  It looks like DOCTOR gave you that last time.  You haven't been taking that?

PATIENT X715
Um I have it but I've probably taken it you know four times cause.

DOCTOR X715
Okay I'm just gonna discontinue that then.

PATIENT X715
Right.  No I just got the first one in the mail and.

DOCTOR X715
Okay.

PATIENT X715
It was a couple of times so I had a headache and I thought well maybe it's related to that.

DOCTOR X715
You got a headache?

PATIENT X715
But I'm not taking it anymore.

DOCTOR X715
Alright.  Let me take a listen to your heart.

PATIENT X715
You want me up there?

DOCTOR X715
That's fine.  Deep breaths in and out, again.  Again.  Good, they sound good.

PATIENT X715
Keep breathing?

DOCTOR X715
One more time, you can breathe normally now.  Any pain when I press here?

PATIENT X715
Uh uh.  I should get rid of it.

DOCTOR X715
Oh the belly.

PATIENT X715
No I'm okay.

DOCTOR X715
You could start working on your diet, low salt.  Any swelling?

PATIENT X715
No.

DOCTOR X715
Good, good.

PATIENT X715
Not generally.

DOCTOR X715
Alright looks good.  So you can pick up your medicines today.  I'll make an appointment with Dermatology uh let me talk with DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

PATIENT X715
So Dermatology is just the desk up front?

DOCTOR X715
Well I think.

PATIENT X715
@@@.

DOCTOR X715
Um basically yeah the front desk should be able to give you an appointment.  If not they'll give you like a phone number or something where you can actually get an appointment. 

PATIENT X715
Uh when I leave here?

DOCTOR X715
Yes.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X715
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:26  DOCTOR IN:  33:35)

DOCTOR X715
Okay.  

PATIENT X715
Hmm.

DOCTOR X715
I just talked with DOCTOR.  Actually uh it's more like up here right?

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
Okay in that case the Ear, Nose and Throat doctors um I'm gonna refer you to them.

PATIENT X715
Hmm.

DOCTOR X715
They'll do a scope and see if there's anything in there.

PATIENT X715
Hmm.

DOCTOR X715
So you can go see them, they're kind of buried now, so they should be able to schedule you up front alright and then pick this up and @@@ okay.  Start with um taking it once daily.

PATIENT X715
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X715
And then kick it up to twice daily if it's necessary.  Drink tons of water and just keep an eye on your blood pressure.  Right now it looks good.  @@@ okay and then for the colonoscopy they'll be contacting you to schedule you and make you an appointment.  Alright.

PATIENT X715
You know what I still have the stuff, the powder.

DOCTOR X715
Oh you do.

PATIENT X715
They wanted me to do it about a year ago and I cancelled it but, but they're gonna call me.

DOCTOR X715
Yes.

PATIENT X715
To set up a time.

DOCTOR X715
Yes.  And let me put in a referral for ENT.  So we'll refer to @@@ in the meanwhile what you can do is yeah go up to the front desk and make an appointment and um pick up your meds.

PATIENT X715

PATIENT X715
No.  I'll probably be back for one of these before then but I'll.

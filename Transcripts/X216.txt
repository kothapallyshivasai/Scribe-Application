 
DOCTOR X216
PATIENT?

PATIENT X216
Yeah, how you doing doc?

DOCTOR X216
Good to see you.  Have a seat.  How you been?

PATIENT X216
Um okay.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
And I found out that @@@.

DOCTOR X216
Really.

PATIENT X216
You know.

DOCTOR X216
What'd your doctor find?

PATIENT X216
Um yeah, no.

DOCTOR X216
When did they @@@, something?

PATIENT X216
Subject.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah what did they say it is?

PATIENT X216
That's not what they told me.  They said it was a uh a uh.

DOCTOR X216
An abscess?

PATIENT X216
Not a cyst but something on my sperm delivery system.  What else, it's a liposil thing.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah it is a cyst.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
Because a cyst is basically liquid that's benign first of all.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
You don't have to worry about anything serious there um but it can be filled with either like water um, it can blocked up sperm, is why it's filled up like that.  In either case I know that they had offered @@@.  If they offered to lump it off.

PATIENT X216
No they didn't.  They said that that would be elective surgery.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah, yeah.  Opening up those abscesses that type of thing, that's the thing so um did they say they wanted to follow up with you though?

PATIENT X216
No.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.  There's no way you can maybe talk to Social Work to see you can get this done?

PATIENT X216
Oh I don't know I mean I tried to talk to the social worker and then everybody at the Urology Clinic told me oh I don't know who to call.

DOCTOR X216
Oh yeah, it's not the same.  You know we have, I think its Financial Services or something like that that may be able to help you out with this.  I know it's an elective surgery.

PATIENT X216
I mean like right now, right now I have, see I usually pay all my VA bills.

DOCTOR X216
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X216
There's one @@@ and I mean I haven't paid since last April so I got all the prescriptions and all the doctors and I got extra doctors in the CPS.

DOCTOR X216
Right.

PATIENT X216
Because of my problem.

DOCTOR X216
Right.  I know, I know.

PATIENT X216
So the VA bill is getting kind of big.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah right.

PATIENT X216
So I mean I could probably stand to see the social worker just @@@.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah that's not a bad idea.  I mean let me see if I can have them talk to you and see if they can help out.  Um how have you been otherwise?  

PATIENT X216
Um.

DOCTOR X216
Have you been doing okay?

PATIENT X216
I stopped taking my pain medicines for a little while.

DOCTOR X216
Is that right?

PATIENT X216
Yeah I slowed down uh and stopped completely @@@.

DOCTOR X216
And how'd it go?

PATIENT X216
Well I've been off of it for a week and it's not going very good at all.  So I want to get back on it.

DOCTOR X216
I @@@ renewed it.

PATIENT X216
You did.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
Cause I didn't see the name on the list when I came in.

DOCTOR X216
Um I filled it up.

PATIENT X216
Today?

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
I hope they didn't mail it out.

DOCTOR X216
They can't, they don't mail morphine out.

PATIENT X216
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X216
So if you still want to get it it is in there.

PATIENT X216
Okay cause I didn't see my name on the board so maybe, maybe they were still getting the dose.  Did you drop them off today?

DOCTOR X216
Yes.

PATIENT X216
Oh okay.  

DOCTOR X216

PATIENT X216
Thank you.  

DOCTOR X216
Yeah you should be able to get it.

PATIENT X216
Thank you.  I didn't bother to call this month because I figured whether you were on top of it or not I @@@ repeat it.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah no you're always, its part of this e-mail.

PATIENT X216
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X216
So I've already ordered it up.

PATIENT X216
So I won't have to call anymore?

DOCTOR X216
Well I would still call.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216

PATIENT X216
Okay.  Cause I meet with, when I'm not seeing you I call about 10 days ahead of time.

DOCTOR X216
Cause it's your pain.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
So um, I'm not the one in pain so sometimes I'm not @@@.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
Um okay so that's that.  Do you @@@ sometimes that the pain is controlled with the @@@.

PATIENT X216

PATIENT X216
I've got an appointment with DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
This afternoon at 3:30.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.  You're probably not going to be @@@.  

PATIENT X216
And uh I had that colonoscopy scheduled.

DOCTOR X216
What happened?

PATIENT X216
I took all the stuff.  I sat on the toilet all night.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
And then in my morning my wife was feeling so terrible and she couldn’t take me and I went through the worst part of it.

DOCTOR X216
The worst part of it is the prep.

PATIENT X216
Yeah I went through the worst part of it and then I couldn't go.

DOCTOR X216
I know, I know.  @@@.  Okay so they said they're still waiting to do it when you want it.

PATIENT X216
Yeah, yeah.  I got it, I had it done I mean the stuff.  My father had.

DOCTOR X216
Your father had colon cancer?

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
Oh goodness and you're 58 okay.  So we'll do it sometime.

PATIENT X216
I mean I haven't had one for sort of like five years at least.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah, well you've had one before?

PATIENT X216
Yeah.  Not here.

DOCTOR X216
Oh @@@ it wasn't here.  That's right @@@ yeah.  Um okay so I'll put that back in.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
Put it back in.  What else we got going on here?  Uh, oh @@@ another copy.  Um @@@ do you have one?

PATIENT X216
I had them both.

DOCTOR X216
Yep, yep, @@@ good.  And your cholesterol is very good I'm not going to recheck that.  @@@.

PATIENT X216
43?

DOCTOR X216
Yes.  @@@.

PATIENT X216
I know.  I've been active all of my life and it's always helped for me.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah definitely, definitely.  Your sugars are very well controlled too.

PATIENT X216
Are they?

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.  I want to take a listen to your lungs.

PATIENT X216
I was telling the doctor, I mean is there is a @@@.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah I have a number from 2009 um that tells you what it's been in the last three months in 2009 and you've been well controlled.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep what you're doing up, cause you know keep watching your diet and @@@ that kind of thing because @@@ that makes your heart @@@.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
You know.  Lean forward for me, deep breath, good, breathe, breathe, out and in, out.  You know this is the hardest thing to talk about how's the smoking going?

PATIENT X216
I'm thinking of quitting.  I have three and.

DOCTOR X216
Are you there yet?

PATIENT X216
@@@ you know this is @@@.

DOCTOR X216
@@@.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
First of all you'd save a lot of money um you know.

PATIENT X216
I don't want to do the classes Thursday because it's too far for me to drive.

DOCTOR X216
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X216
You know and with me on a limited income uh I can't afford to come over here.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.

PATIENT X216
Two or three times a week.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.  The first question is though do you want to quit?  If you don't, I can't really talk much more.  I can tell you why you should quit and maybe that would make you.

PATIENT X216
I've been thinking in the last week yes.

DOCTOR X216
Uh-huh.  Okay, okay.  Um, well the important thing is you know you're quitting.  I can't stress to you, you @@@ real disease of your lungs and all that kind of thing.  @@@ these problems and adds more problems.  Smoking one of the things it does in terms of your lungs is it clamps down your vessels and when you walk it gives you even more pain in your vessels there.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
The blood @@@ and then now I don't know what the pain comes from, especially @@@.  I'm sure you know about that.  @@@ dramatically higher than normal people.  Other disease is called COPD, an obstructive problem.  I don't know if you get @@@ when you walk around at all.

PATIENT X216
No.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.

PATIENT X216
I've been walking all my life.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
And it doesn't bother me.

DOCTOR X216
So if you do any activities or anything a guy will have a cough or @@@ okay so that's probably a bronchitis type of thing.  Um so not only the heart disease, hypertension, kidney disease, stroke all these things are increased with smoking.  I can’t tell you these stories to quit smoking.  I can't emphasis that enough.  What you can try to do is, if you're willing to quit.  You have to be realistic.  How much you smoke a day?

PATIENT X216
One and a half pack.

DOCTOR X216
Um do you want to try nicotine patches or the gum?

PATIENT X216
No but my wife said that that's the only thing that ever worked for her.

DOCTOR X216
There's nothing to say you could try the patches, you could try the gum, you could try the lozenges, you can try Chantix, but the first in the line of things is to try nicotine replacement.  So you could start with the patch.  I'll give a trial of the patch okay and by the end of the two weeks you should be stopped.  Now that's a lofty goal, that's a lofty goal okay.  Cessation of smoking is the only way to do this but try to do the patch okay.  See if you can cut down from a pack to like a half pack.  Something like that and then you'll eventually get down to none, that's your goal okay.

PATIENT X216
My first of the cigarette of the day @@@ bother me.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
You know and it's just getting to the point I need to quit.

DOCTOR X216
I think that you'll find that you'll save a bunch of money.  You'll feel much better okay and things you don't notice are things that you're body's reacting to.  Your heart will be better.  Your blood pressure will get better once you've quit.  So you want to try to do the patch?

PATIENT X216
Sure.

DOCTOR X216
Okay let's give it a try.  Let me know. Uh I'll be honest you know you give it your best go.  You think you've got a bad time, okay, sometimes @@@ of if people do quit they start smoking again.  It's kind of a lifelong thing but I'm sure this guy will stop.  The last thing I'd like to do here is you have a little bit of a cough @@@ short of breath.  I'd like to get some lung studies on you.  Have you ever heard of anything called pulmonary function tests?

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.  Have you ever done the tests?

PATIENT X216
Yeah but @@@.

DOCTOR X216
No, no, no it's not that.  That's just uh, I don't think you've done a pulmonary function tests before.  This is where they make you blow into a machine and they test how big your, what your lung volumes are and that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X216
Oh I think I've done that before.

DOCTOR X216
Oh have you?  Well I just, yeah let me take a look here.

PATIENT X216
Not here.

DOCTOR X216
Oh, like somewhere else.

PATIENT X216
They used to do that with us yearly when I worked for a paper company up north.

DOCTOR X216
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X216
And then they would do it yearly when I worked for the power company down in xxx.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.

PATIENT X216
So this was you know like 16 years ago.

DOCTOR X216
I gotcha.  Let me order that for you, see what they show.

PATIENT X216
Sure.

DOCTOR X216
Okay good.  And we'll see what else, I'll see if I can talk to the social worker for you and maybe set up a meeting.  Okay, let me talk to my attending and I'll be right back with you.

PATIENT X216
Great.

DOCTOR X216
I'll be right back alright.

PATIENT X216
No, well kind uh.  @@@.  I have my name on here @@@ you can find it or not.  This is so that I can drive, so I can get insurance to drive.  Now before they would let me drive, when I was up here last year.

DOCTOR X216
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X216
Before they would let me drive again they gave me a test and I passed the test with flying colors.  When I was on the pain medication, now I don't know.

DOCTOR X216
Why did they make you do that?

PATIENT X216
Uh I told them that I wasn't working anymore and that I was on disability.

DOCTOR X216
Oh.

PATIENT X216
And they said then what kind of medicines are you taking and when I said morphine they said well okay then you got to fill this out.

DOCTOR X216
Oh really?  @@@ okay.

PATIENT X216
@@@.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah so you're not going to know @@@.

PATIENT X216
Spinal stenosis.

DOCTOR X216
No @@@ spinal stenosis.

PATIENT X216
@@@.  Smokers @@@.

DOCTOR X216
@@@ they're not going to know what that is either.  @@@.  Medications morphine oral uh, COPD, hypertension.  @@@.  Oh you're taking it four times a day.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
Every four hours.  @@@.  

PATIENT X216
I don't know @@@. 

DOCTOR X216
@@@.

PATIENT X216
No.

DOCTOR X216
Oh, good.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
Now, I never asked you how is that mass doing, any pain?

PATIENT X216
It's a pain.

DOCTOR X216
@@@.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah. 

PATIENT X216
Well it really hasn't gotten any larger.  The largest it was was when it got to a certain size when I came in to see you, I mean right around that area @@@.

DOCTOR X216
@@@.

PATIENT X216
And @@@.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.

(DOCTOR 27:55  DOCTOR IN:  32:38)

DOCTOR X216
Okay, I just trying to summarize over what we're going to do for you a few things um, I want reorder the @@@ and I'll have them call you about that.  I'm going to order nicotine patch and you'll get the morphine and you can pick that up too.  Uh again it's one patch for two weeks.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
So hopefully you'll be down quite a bit by that time but if you don't take @@@ but if we can continue with the goal of cutting down by our next visit, @@@ every little bit.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.  Uh and the last is the pulmonary function tests also they'll call you about that you need one.

PATIENT X216
Uh I have one more @@@.  That terazosin.

DOCTOR X216
Terazosin?

PATIENT X216
Terazosin.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
For my bladder, my.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.

PATIENT X216
The guy downstairs ordered that for me.

DOCTOR X216
Uh-huh, yeah I see that.

PATIENT X216
And uh it makes me feel groggy so I stopped taking it.

DOCTOR X216
Okay did it affect your bladder now or how have you done with that?

PATIENT X216
You know it didn't really make any difference.

DOCTOR X216
In the first place?

PATIENT X216
Yeah.  I started on that and they gave me this regimen, it was supposed to last more or less, I don't know two or three week's total.

DOCTOR X216
Right.

PATIENT X216
Whatever.

DOCTOR X216
Oh they started you in the GU Clinic.

PATIENT X216
Yeah.

DOCTOR X216
Okay.

PATIENT X216
And uh I went to the first, I through the whole carton; it didn't seem to make that much difference except it made me feel sleepy all the time.

DOCTOR X216
Yeah.  Okay that's fine and why don't you mention that when you see them again.  Cause you're the one saying you're going to see them again.  I want you again colonoscopy, PFTs, get the @@@.  The other thing for you is that I want you to sit outside, I had the social worker contacted and she's going to talk to you about some stuff okay.  I think you should have the surgery and the VA, even though elective, should cover it and you'd have to probably pay some sort of a small co-pay on top of it but in terms of the surgery it's not going to be that expensive for you okay, @@@.  So why don't you talk to her though okay and @@@.  In the meantime, if you're doing much better why don't we see each other in six months okay?

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
And you can get that scheduled up front but first take this and the other paperwork.

PATIENT X216
Okay.

DOCTOR X216
Good to see you.

PATIENT X216
Thanks a lot doc.  You know there's a @@@ that reminds of @@@.

DOCTOR X216
@@@.

PATIENT X216
@@@.  Okay thank you.

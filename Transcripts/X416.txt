PATIENT X416
Yes.

DOCTOR X416
Yeah cause I know you were seen by the kidney doctors and they said you absolutely do not want dialysis is that right?

PATIENT X416
Right.

DOCTOR X416
So are you on any medications?

PATIENT X416
Yes I, right now I used the last one and I run out of this one here.  This one I run out @@@.

DOCTOR X416
This is the one the kidney doctors prescribed you right?

PATIENT X416
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X416
See if they refilled it for you.  You should still be on the calcium carbonate, let's just see what they said.  Are you taking the kayexalate that's uh the thing they gave you at the uh kidney doctors?  Like that liquid stuff?

PATIENT X416
The kayexalate.

DOCTOR X416
Yeah you still taking that?

PATIENT X416
Uh I haven't taken any of that stuff yet.

DOCTOR X416
You haven't taken any of it yet?

PATIENT X416
No.

DOCTOR X416
Why not?

PATIENT X416
I don't know.

DOCTOR X416
You should start taking it.

PATIENT X416
Alright.

DOCTOR X416
Cause they're worried because your potassium was really high and that can cause you to have a heart attack.

PATIENT X416
Alright.

DOCTOR X416
And we don't want that.

PATIENT X416
Alright.

DOCTOR X416
Okay.  So start taking that.  Can I see that medication bottle one more time and let me figure out.  Okay I refilled this.  What about the rest of your meds?  Do you still have all those?

PATIENT X416
Yes.

DOCTOR X416
Yeah.

PATIENT X416
I have some refills.

DOCTOR X416
I want to make sure you have enough to last you till your next appointment.  I think you're gonna run out so I'm gonna refill everything for you okay.

PATIENT X416
Alright.  They usually send it to me when I run out.

DOCTOR X416
Yeah they usually send it to you but if you run out then they can't send it to you right.  Like if you run out of refills.

PATIENT X416
That's why I should know when I have to renew cause they usually run out.

DOCTOR X416
Yeah they do and that's why we have to refill them for you before they run out of refills.  Make sense?

PATIENT X416
I don't know.

DOCTOR X416
(Laughter)  You know what, I see you're gonna be seeing the kidney doctors in see, do you have an appointment coming up with the kidney doctors?

PATIENT X416
I don't know when the next appointment is.  I ain't got nothing @@@ or anything. 

DOCTOR X416
They wanted to see you back in a month and that was back in November so I think we need to schedule you for a follow-up kidney doctor appointment okay.

PATIENT X416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X416
Other than that you're doing okay though huh?

PATIENT X416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X416
Okay.  Want to have a seat up here for me and I can examine you?  I'm looking to see when the last time we got a cholesterol panel on you.  Can you look straight ahead for me?  Open your mouth, stick your tongue out and say ah.

PATIENT X416
Ah.

DOCTOR X416
Give me some big deep breaths.  Good, breathe normally.  Good.  Numbness or tingling in your fingers or toes?

PATIENT X416
No.

DOCTOR X416
Stomach pain?

SECOND DOCTOR X416
Hey PATIENT.

PATIENT X416
Hi.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
How are you?

PATIENT X416
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
Okay.  Um are you watching your diet and @@@ off the potassium?

PATIENT X416
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X416
High potassium diet.

PATIENT X416
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
You're watching like bananas, oranges okay.  But you haven't taken that sweet liquid?

PATIENT X416
Hmm?

SECOND DOCTOR X416
The kayexalate, the one that tastes really sweet? 

PATIENT X416
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
Do you have it at home?

PATIENT X416
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
You do, okay.  I'm going to check your potassium again today so I don't want you to leave.  I want you to come back after your blood tests done and just wait out there because I need to make sure it's not too dangerously elevated and PATIENT you are @@@ readings quite fast, quite rapidly and I think the dialysis is eminent.  So I think you need to come to the conclusion that you really need it otherwise you I mean this is life-threatening.  You may not need it immediately but that might be in near future and you will need it.  What is that you are concerned about?  A lot of people are on dialysis.  They start you @@@ started on dialysis.

PATIENT X416
Well I.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
And they do fine.

PATIENT X416
Don't like the idea, @@@ three hours I don't like that.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
Well you are otherwise doing okay.  I think that dialysis is I mean.  I mean unfortunately we don't have any other way to protect your kidneys.  I don't think it's.  I mean the idea is bad to start it but once you get used to it I'm sure you'll.  I mean it's not as bad as you think.

PATIENT X416
Well I'll never get used to it.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
But the problem is, @@@ uh I mean that it's going to be your life support measure.  Without it.

PATIENT X416
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
People die.

PATIENT X416
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
You're not there yet but I'm sure that I want you to get used to the idea.

PATIENT X416
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
So you do not decline.  That's what @@@.  That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

PATIENT X416
Yeah @@@.  I have to give it some thought.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
Okay because I don't want you to just, just without any thinking.

PATIENT X416
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X416
Uh not.  Okay.  Alright.  So do the blood, wait out there and then we'll make your kidney doctors appointment okay.

PATIENT X416
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X416
Alright so I want you to go to the Lab and get your blood drawn and then come back here okay.  And up front they're gonna schedule you in the clinic.  So I want you to go up front, schedule the appointment, go to the Lab get your blood drawn and come back here okay.

PATIENT X416

PATIENT.

PATIENT X498
PATIENT thank you, okay doc.  

DOCTOR X498
Hi DOCTOR come on back.

PATIENT X498
Yeah I know you guys get in trouble keeping my appointments you know.

DOCTOR X498
Especially @@@.

PATIENT X498
Okay, alright, that's good.

DOCTOR X498
Alright.  How's everything going today?

PATIENT X498
What is happening is @@@ problem.  The only problem @@@ eight or nine years ago, August of 2008 @@@.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
So I'm in a slumber sleeping in the morning and got out of bed and just got the worst pain that I ever felt in my life.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
Come to find out I had two slipped disks, L4 and L5.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
Back in xxx them doctors August 2008 and due to my, I had issues with substance abuse.

DOCTOR X498
Right.

PATIENT X498
Uh I'm stabilized and I'm gonna, I can beat this concise, I can focus but this back is killing.  I haven't gotten it taken care of yet.

DOCTOR X498
@@@.

PATIENT X498
No.  I had an MRI and a uh some x-rays at West LA VA before I came home in August 2008.  I wonder if you can pull that up but here I think I've had at least the x-rays done under that but didn't get an MRI at xxx Brown since I've been back in xxx and I really want to get this taken care of.  It's really bothering me.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
It's just, I mean the last.

DOCTOR X498
Well it sounds like you have arthritis in your back.

PATIENT X498
You know what, I was planning on.

DOCTOR X498
And um 

PATIENT X498
How did you come to this conclusion?  Did you just, just by your knowledge?

DOCTOR X498
Yeah, yeah just @@@.

PATIENT X498
Yeah.  Someone said that I had an x-ray done at a hospital.

DOCTOR X498
You know we could still look.

PATIENT X498
And they said, they pretty much thought it was arthritis too.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.  Well one thing at a time though and we haven't seen you.

PATIENT X498
Exactly.

DOCTOR X498
In a follow-up visit in quite some.

PATIENT X498
Exactly.

DOCTOR X498
So today, let's just kind of get you plugged back into the system.

PATIENT X498
Okay sounds good doc.

DOCTOR X498
Uh it looks like you're on, you know, a number of medications.

PATIENT X498
Quite a list.

DOCTOR X498
For blood pressure, diabetes, asthma uh, probably what we're gonna follow you here in the General Medicine Clinic for.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
What do you take for your blood pressure?

PATIENT X498
I take uh lisinopril.

DOCTOR X498
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X498
I think its 40 mg.

DOCTOR X498
It is.

PATIENT X498
Once a day and metoprolol.  I can't pronounce it.

DOCTOR X498
Metoprolol.

PATIENT X498
Yeah I take, uh I don't how much is the medicine but it should be in the computer on my.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
Yeah.

DOCTOR X498
How about the diabetes?  What are you taking for it?

PATIENT X498
They put me on insulin the last time I was here.  The doctor put me on insulin.

DOCTOR X498
How much do you take?

PATIENT X498
I take 48 of 70/30 NovoLog.

DOCTOR X498
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X498
48 in the morning and 46 at night.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.  Uh and what have your sugars been running?

PATIENT X498
My sugar's been running from like 130 to 160, 170, which is a little high but.

DOCTOR X498
Is that before you eat or after you eat?

PATIENT X498
This is after I eat.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.  What are they usually before you eat?

PATIENT X498
Before I eat they go to 190, 210, 220.

DOCTOR X498
So before you eat the blood sugars are higher?

PATIENT X498
Um, okay let me think about this um.

DOCTOR X498
Do you happen to have blood sugar journal?

PATIENT X498
I didn't bring it with me, I forgot the glucometer, I left that at home.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
But usually the sugars, they're higher before I eat.

DOCTOR X498
It doesn't make any sense.

PATIENT X498
In other words, after I, okay when I test my blood sugar before I take the insulin it's usually high 130, 140, its usually out of the normal range.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
And so I'm testing basically once twice a day is that good or should I be testing more often?

DOCTOR X498
Well it depends how stable they are you know.  If your blood sugars are usually stable then you only need to probably check twice a day.

PATIENT X498
But.

DOCTOR X498
But if they're kind of up and down you should test more than that.

PATIENT X498
Uh okay, so maybe I need to do what uh four times a day?

DOCTOR X498
Well it depends you know.

PATIENT X498
Well they've been running pretty decent.  In other words, I cut back and you know there's some things I know I can do.  I cut back on the cheating.

DOCTOR X498
Uh any episodes of low sugars?

PATIENT X498
No.

DOCTOR X498
Okay, good.  Alright.  Now asthma wise how's your breathing?

PATIENT X498
My breathing has been uh it's been good.  I haven't had an asthma attack in a couple of years.

DOCTOR X498
Uh what are you taking for the asthma?

PATIENT X498
Asthma, I take the steroid inhaler.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
And the Proventil inhaler.  I'm out of my @@@.

DOCTOR X498
Sure, no problem.

PATIENT X498
Yeah I need some med refills.

DOCTOR X498
Okay we can definitely do that.  Um so like I said you know I was, with this visit, I'd really like to get you plugged back in to the system.

PATIENT X498
Okay.  Okay I understand.

DOCTOR X498
Let's establish some you know baseline diabetes labs on your.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
Let's check an average sugar level, let's refill your meds.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
Your blood pressure was very good today and I hope you're very happy about that uh and then we need to do some health maintenance things.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
Uh you're over the age of 50 so you need a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
To check for colon cancer.

PATIENT X498
Now what does that entail, the colonoscopy?  Is that when they, I know there's a couple of ways they can go but they use the instrument?

DOCTOR X498
Well they take a fiberoptic camera; it's about the size of a pen.

PATIENT X498
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X498
They put it up your bottom.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
Where we know @@@ colon cancer.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
Cause really, it's a very good test, it saves lots of lives.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
So I would recommend it.

PATIENT X498
Okay sure.

DOCTOR X498
Um the other thing is is that if you're a diabetic you need an eye exam once a year so I want to schedule you for an eye exam.

PATIENT X498
Yeah I need it, yeah I need it cause I need new glasses anyway.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
So that would be good.

DOCTOR X498
And then uh the third thing is that uh we'll check the cholesterol today so.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
Alright, alright.  Let's just see if there's anything else that we need.  Now this back pain, like we probably could do an x-ray.  We don't have one in the system so let's do an x-ray to start out with before we just to an MRI.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
And then we'll go from there.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.  Well if you'll have a seat, let me take a look at you here.  Where you living these days?

PATIENT X498
I'm living in xxx with my sister.

DOCTOR X498
Okay.

PATIENT X498
On 55th and 3rd on @@@.

DOCTOR X498
@@@ I hear you, I got it.  Alright show me where you're having most of the pain would you say.

PATIENT X498
Right in this lower area here.

DOCTOR X498
Is it worse when you walk or sit or stand?

PATIENT X498
It's um, its worse when I walk.  It's worse when I walk and I had total right hip replacement.

DOCTOR X498
Hmm.

PATIENT X498
In 2008 and 2006.

DOCTOR X498
Some deep breaths, nice deep breaths.  Just breathe normal for me.  Are you able to examine your feet every day?

PATIENT X498
Uh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X498
Can you take your shoes and socks off so I could see them?  You can sit back down there yeah.  Uh the reason we're so adamant about this is diabetes is the number one cause of amputations in this country.

PATIENT X498
Right.

DOCTOR X498
So it's very important for all diabetics to check their feet every day.

PATIENT X498
Every day.

DOCTOR X498
To be very careful about any kind of ulcers that develop.

PATIENT X498
Alright, you want both of them?

DOCTOR X498
Yeah I want both of them, we gotta check both of them.

PATIENT X498
I don't know, I had to go check it before I came up to see you.  I need some lotion, they're pretty dry.

DOCTOR X498
Well lotion is not as important.  You really just.

PATIENT X498
Check them for sores and.

DOCTOR X498
You gotta make sure that there's no ulcers.  We see, I see tons of diabetics who've lost feet, legs, all that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X498
What causes the amputations?

DOCTOR X498
It's the diabetes.  The high sugar levels.

PATIENT X498
Yes.

DOCTOR X498
Gets into the nerves and it destroys the nerves of the feet.

PATIENT X498
Oh I see okay.

DOCTOR X498
Okay and that's what, people need some amputations.  How's your feeling over here?

PATIENT X498
Oh good.  I was getting a little tingling.

DOCTOR X498
Can you feel this?

PATIENT X498
Yes.

DOCTOR X498
Okay how about this side can you feel this?

PATIENT X498
Yes.

DOCTOR X498
Alright good, good, good, good.  Alright so PATIENT I think that's our plan for today.  We got our work cut out for us.

PATIENT X498
Well I got all the time; whatever you want me to do I'll take care of.

DOCTOR X498
Yeah so we'll schedule you for these tests um and then uh we'll see you back uh you know after all these tests are done and then you know we'll uh you know kind of reconvene, see what they show and go from there.

PATIENT X498
So how long do you think @@@ return appointment?

DOCTOR X498
Oh let's see, you need a colonoscopy, eye exam, these labs and we'll get the x-ray so it's gonna be, by the time you get all these appointments and the tests are done and back in the computer it's gonna be about a couple of months.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498
So we'll see you probably back in two months.  In the meantime I'll make sure you got enough medicines.

PATIENT X498
Okay.

DOCTOR X498

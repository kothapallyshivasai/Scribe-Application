DOCTOR X574

DOCTOR X574
@@@.

PATIENT X574
Okay.  So the one I say you got an order on that right?  

DOCTOR X574
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X574
Okay.

DOCTOR X574
I'm typing it in right now.

PATIENT X574
Alright.

DOCTOR X574
And tell me what you've been doing with your diet.

PATIENT X574
I've been, I've been trying to get those 3 1/2 meals.  I'm trying to get always three in.  Sometimes I can get it in and sometime I can't but I'm going to the gym every day.  I don't know it just don't feeling like the weight wanna come off.  It don't, it's just I don't understand it you know.  And the more I work out, it like it just stays.  You think I got a ulcer or something cause they had to put me.  I had the stomach, one of them showing @@@.  Uh @@@ thing you gave me when they.

DOCTOR X574
The ultrasound?

PATIENT X574
Yeah it didn't show no adenoma @@@.

DOCTOR X574
No are you having stomach pain?

PATIENT X574
No, I just can't understand why my stomach won't go down you know.  I'm doing sit-ups, I'm riding a bike and I don't know what's wrong with this thing.  I'm thinking I might have Crohn's disease or something.  I ain't got Crohn's disease do I?

DOCTOR X574
No, that usually makes people not gain weight but they have a lot of diarrhea and constipation.

PATIENT X574
But do they @@@.

DOCTOR X574
Not as much no.  Not the same in that, it all just comes out the other end.

PATIENT X574
@@@ see if they got that suction and the stomach @@@.  I got to have some help with this thing.  I know what I'm doing maybe it ain't working, it ain't working.  

DOCTOR X574
Do you feel like your pants are getting loser or you're getting more muscle?

PATIENT X574
I well I'm getting more, I'm getting stronger, I'm getting stronger but some of my clothes uh getting lose you know.  I can see, sometimes I can lose, I feel like I losing inches you know and then but the weight is still there and like uh two weeks ago I weighed and I was 297.5, now this morning I'm 299, that pound and a half come from less than a week and a half, less than two weeks.  And I want you know, I don't know, I don't know.  It seems like it just, it's hard to take a deep breath of air, it'll be 30 pounds.  

DOCTOR X574
I know some people will actually notice their weight will stay about the same or even go up if they start working out because muscle weighs more than fat.

PATIENT X574
As a matter of fact, I been training at the gym so I know all about that.  My thing is me, why I can't, I'm doing everything I @@@ to get rid of this stomach and it don't seem to be working you know.  I need help, I need, even if I gotta go somewhere else and see if they can do that uh stomach stapling or that liposuction.  

DOCTOR X574
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X574
I need something like that cause it would take me ten years if I could do it but this ain't working for me.

DOCTOR X574
Do you have any supplemental insurance on top of what the VA has for you?

PATIENT X574
No.

DOCTOR X574
Okay.  So if we look for something I'll try to, I'll ask the attending to see if they know if the procedures they do it here if you are eligible.

PATIENT X574
Right and it @@@ it hinders or helps you know.  It's not making me feel any better and uh and messing with my blood pressure, it got to be cause all of this weight and stuff you know so.  Just like you could recommend it.

DOCTOR X574
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X574
You know.  But it is interfering.

DOCTOR X574
@@@ ultrasound.

PATIENT X574
Okay.

DOCTOR X574
@@@ it's about the same as the last time it was done.

PATIENT X574
Yeah I don't know.  @@@.  I don't understand what's going on, what's going on.

DOCTOR X574
Gotcha.

PATIENT X574
Uh last week, I @@@ know anything about the gym and how to get their weight and things.

DOCTOR X574
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X574
But I was, I squat 505 pounds, three reps.

DOCTOR X574
505?

PATIENT X574
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X574
That's a lot.

PATIENT X574
It is a lot but I'm getting stronger but I can't lose this stomach you know.  In that in the gym I lift weights, the cardiac machine, I'm constantly on it and I don't know.  I don't want to do it too much because your stomach would turn into muscle.

DOCTOR X574
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X574
You know then I'm just stuck with a big old muscle.

DOCTOR X574
@@@.

PATIENT X574
Yeah then it'd be out to here and I never would be able to give you a big old, like I got a six month baby stomach muscle but the fact is I can't get rid of it anyway because of the muscle you know.  I don't know about that, I don't know.  It's a dilemma for me.  You know, I don't and I can't and my clothes, I don't like the way I look in my clothes now.  Man, I don't look the same, my stomach.  I like I'm neat, I like to look good but this thing here causes a problem for me and see it ain't shaking my confidence cause I can deal with anything but I just don't like the way I look but I'm not gonna you know.  I don't know it's, it's a hassle.  I'm just, maybe I'm too vain but I don't want this stomach I know that.

DOCTOR X574
@@@.

PATIENT X574
Yeah.  You know I can't predict anything.  I'm working out hard and it's not working.

DOCTOR X574
Let me take a listen to your heart and lungs.

PATIENT X574
Okay sure.

DOCTOR X574
What kind of @@@.

PATIENT X574
Okay.

DOCTOR X574

PATIENT X574
Alright.

PATIENT X574
I thought you had a Code Blue.

DOCTOR X574

PATIENT X574

DOCTOR X574
They said it was in the @@@ tower and then they said the Reception Center and then @@@.

PATIENT X574
Yeah but then they said something about @@@.

DOCTOR X574
Yeah we have a Code Team that will go.

PATIENT X574

DOCTOR X574
DOCTOR went to find a prescription pad.

PATIENT X574
Okay.

DOCTOR X574
He'll be in shortly.

PATIENT X574
Alright.

DOCTOR X574
But we need, so I talked to him a little bit about what options that we have and unfortunately we don't have anyone who does liposuction here.

PATIENT X574
Did you check with xxx?

DOCTOR X574
Huh?

PATIENT X574
xxx xxx?

DOCTOR X574
I don't know cause we don't have anyone here that works at xxx.

PATIENT X574
Yeah but I can go to xxx and have it done because if xxx do it.

DOCTOR X574
They might have it.

PATIENT X574
Yeah but you gonna check, how you gonna check with xxx see if xxx handles it cause if you don't have doesn't mean xxx don't have it.

DOCTOR X574
No I mean I don't think the VA has this.

PATIENT X574
Oh, oh I gotcha.  Okay I see they probably that's something for me to do okay.

DOCTOR X574
Yeah.

PATIENT X574
Alright.

DOCTOR X574
And then.

PATIENT X574
I got you, I understand.  Uh but you say you don't think VA has it so you really don't know.

DOCTOR X574
No we do have a VA Plastic Surgery section but they do more things like skin flaps or like reconstruction of someone's you know broken their hand and they need to cover the area that's not healing well.  I've never seen anyone there do anything like liposuction.

PATIENT X574
There's probably a first time for everything.

DOCTOR X574
No.

PATIENT X574
@@@ you know you never saw you have to ask them and see if, just if they do either.  You got to guess you know you not certain.

DOCTOR X574
Okay.

PATIENT X574
Alright.  You're not certain of it.  And did you guys decide whether I take my lisinopril?

DOCTOR X574
Hold on one second, are you still smoking?

PATIENT X574
Yes.

DOCTOR X574
They do have a bariatric surgery that does bypass and banding around the stomach.

PATIENT X574
Uh yeah actually that's two of them.

DOCTOR X574
Yeah they won't do, we don't have a plastic surgery that does liposuction but bariatric surgery we do have but you can't be smoking.

PATIENT X574
Well then when do I got to stop?

DOCTOR X574
As soon as possible.  Cause they won't even see you.

PATIENT X574

DOCTOR X574
Have you ever had any abdominal surgeries before?

PATIENT X574
No but I've had my stomach, I had open heart surgery.

DOCTOR X574
Okay.  They just wonder how complicated it's gonna be.  Because the more surgeries you have the more scar tissue you have.

PATIENT X574
No, no, no.  I don't know if I have no scar, but I don't go out naked.

DOCTOR X574
Okay.

PATIENT X574

DOCTOR X574

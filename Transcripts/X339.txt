DOCTOR X339
Okay.

PATIENT X339
But @@@ getting problem, except a @@@ fluid was building up and they went up and drained it, the orthopedists drained it twice right.  Uh I also @@@ went and ran a test on it so they recommend me to a pain therapist.

DOCTOR X339

DOCTOR X339
Oh okay so.

PATIENT X339
So they recommended pills for me, alcryx, 0.6 twice a day.

DOCTOR X339

That was what was on the bottle.

DOCTOR X339
Hmm.  Okay.  @@@.  Did they say you had gout?

PATIENT X339

DOCTOR X339
So okay, so you're on colchicine and how is your @@@ now?

PATIENT X339
Fantastic.  Never felt better.

DOCTOR X339
You said that was 0.6 mg tablet.

PATIENT X339
Yes, yeah, twice a day.  If @@@ can I get that prescription through the VA?

DOCTOR X339
Yeah.  I just want to make sure it's the right medication though.

PATIENT X339
It's a little purple pill.

DOCTOR X339
I think it is yeah.  It's called Colcar, it's actually the same thing as colchicine.

PATIENT X339
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.  

PATIENT X339
So then after that went, the only reason I went back was for them to take blood out, check blood and I was very deficient on vitamin D.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.

PATIENT X339
So they started me on vitamin D 2000 per day.

DOCTOR X339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X339
And then once a week another one at 50,000.

DOCTOR X339
Okay yeah, yeah, yeah.  So vitamin D, is that working well?

PATIENT X339
2000 per day.

DOCTOR X339
Yeah and then the shot.

PATIENT X339
And then once a week and I usually take it on Friday 50,000.

DOCTOR X339
And do you okay.  Do you have @@@?

PATIENT X339
I don't think so.  They said even being out in the sun I would not get enough vitamin D to bring it down.

DOCTOR X339
Do you have like a lab value of your low vitamin D?

PATIENT X339
I don't have it with me here.  I can get it from them.

DOCTOR X339
You need this vitamin D cause I would check the vitamin D level before giving you this.

PATIENT X339
They did over there, it was way down, but I don't remember where it was.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.  Alright um.

PATIENT X339
It was very low.

DOCTOR X339
Do you get it from the VA?

PATIENT X339
@@@ refills.  @@@ to do the blood work before the appointment @@@ come.  

DOCTOR X339
Alright.

PATIENT X339

DOCTOR X339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X339
And I got a copy of it yesterday and I didn't see it on there.

DOCTOR X339

DOCTOR X339
Cause I mean if you're having like active infection or if you're actually having pain then we'll get it.

PATIENT X339
Okay well, whatever was in that there I; I don't think I always thought it was old age.  @@@ but I guess @@@ gout is and I feel @@@ you know it's like oh my God, what's in that pill that makes me feel so good and I know it's an expensive pill and I didn't know if I could get that through the VA or not.

DOCTOR X339
@@@.

PATIENT X339
@@@.  It's hurting a little bit but then @@@ not a problem you know.  And they went back and says no, they called up right away and said you could see the crystals in the urine right there, like you have a very high @@@.

DOCTOR X339
Oh.

PATIENT X339
Check that and see what the doctor @@@ to give me the shot or not.

DOCTOR X339
Uh-huh.  Okay, so your HDL, your good cholesterol has come down a little bit, @@@ it should be around 40 okay, so it needs to be higher.

PATIENT X339
But it's coming down and not going up.

DOCTOR X339
Yeah and lipids should be going up cause we know @@@ this is the good one and it should go up okay.  So what I'm going to do for that is that you're on niacin right?

PATIENT X339
Right.

DOCTOR X339
So you're taking niacin 500 mg?

PATIENT X339
500 right.

DOCTOR X339
We'll change you to 1000 mg and see how you do.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.

PATIENT X339
So the good went down and the bad @@@.

DOCTOR X339
Yeah but the bad went up to 110 but it's not like your goal for that is 130.

PATIENT X339
Okay.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X339
Okay.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.  You know we also, for everybody that has cholesterol, it's @@@ go up on your medication, it depends on the specific person.  So we have to @@@ stop this or @@@ coronary artery disease before I can @@@ some of the medication

PATIENT X339
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X339
But each patient's goal is different so I'm going to get @@@ refills now and then um what I'm going to do next is kind of adjust the medication accordingly.

PATIENT X339
Okay.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.  It's kind of like @@@.

PATIENT X339
Ah.

DOCTOR X339
So you're 66 is that right?

PATIENT X339
66 yes.

DOCTOR X339
Yes.

PATIENT X339
I'll be 67 in September.

DOCTOR X339
Okay so age @@@, the blood pressure matters, @@@ cholesterol matters, your HDL is running low and you are on blood pressure, you don't smoke right?

PATIENT X339
Nope.

DOCTOR X339
You don't have diabetes.

PATIENT X339
Nope.

DOCTOR X339
So I think I'll just keep it the way it is for now and see how you do.

PATIENT X339
See how I do, okay.

DOCTOR X339
We always can go up.  Cause you were on 80 before right?

PATIENT X339
Yes.

DOCTOR X339
I would go up just a little bit to 40 and just keep you on that because I think we'd just have better control with the 40.

PATIENT X339
@@@.

DOCTOR X339
Okay.  @@@ niacin at all cause that's going to affect your HDL @@@, so we'll keep you on 40 @@@. 

PATIENT X339
Okay.

DOCTOR X339
@@@.  Let's see what else.  @@@ and you did your colonoscopy already right?

PATIENT X339
Right.

DOCTOR X339
So we talked about @@@.

PATIENT X339
@@@ it's supposed to be down to like 117 @@@.  I think I need to do more exercising and burn it off that way.

DOCTOR X339
Yeah.

PATIENT X339
I think I've learned my portion size and now I just get the exercise in and @@@ like that.  I've been wanting to do that @@@.  And I can quit @@@.

DOCTOR X339
And then we ought to, so we kind of check the PSA levels and the last one in February @@@ checking it right?

PATIENT X339
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X339
Um so your PSA is 1.37 um and in the past they were a little bit lower.  Just so you know, that doesn't mean anything in terms of its dangerous and all okay.

PATIENT X339
Okay.

DOCTOR X339
It just means that it's higher um and I just wanted to ask you do you have any symptoms at all.  Like are you feeling like um, do you feel like you have urination at all?

PATIENT X339

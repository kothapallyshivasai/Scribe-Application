DOCTOR X513
Cause you have been in and out of the hospital.

PATIENT X513
Continuously.

DOCTOR X513
I'm here more times than I can tell.

PATIENT X513
Right.

DOCTOR X513
Alright so since the last time you saw us, about a year ago, a few things have happened right.  You've had surgery up here.  You got surgery on your foot.  You had that cardiac catheterization done.

PATIENT X513
That's right.

DOCTOR X513
You were seen at xxx, you're like uh we'll just manage you with your medicines right, is that what they decided?

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
Okay and then recently you were just hospitalized because you were having nausea and vomiting.

PATIENT X513
Yeah.

DOCTOR X513
So @@@.

PATIENT X513
And also I had uh amputation.

DOCTOR X513
Yep, yep.  That's a lot, that's enough for you.

PATIENT X513
Yeah.

DOCTOR X513
You don't get any more for the rest of the year.

PATIENT X513
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X513
Um how are you, how's the nausea and the vomiting?

PATIENT X513
Um right now it's relatively cool.  I haven't had much of it.

DOCTOR X513
Okay.  Um those pills they gave you, that xxx and metoclopramide, it's that one you take before you eat, is that helping?

PATIENT X513
I don't know tell me.  I mean I take the medicine so maybe it is.

DOCTOR X513
So it is cause it's not coming back right.

PATIENT X513
Right.

DOCTOR X513
We could keep going with it okay.  We don't want to mess up a good thing alright, okay.  And then that other stomach acid medicine, the ranitidine, has that been helping you?

PATIENT X513
That's the one for the gut?

DOCTOR X513
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X513
No the gut is the one you take before the meal.

DOCTOR X513
Okay.  The other one is uh.

SECOND PERSON X513
It's that half a pill that you take.

DOCTOR X513
Twice a day?

SECOND PERSON X513
Twice a day for the stomach.

DOCTOR X513
Okay, okay.

SECOND PERSON X513
So he's been taking that.

DOCTOR X513
Okay.  So tell me what you're taking for your diabetes?

PATIENT X513
Uh 10 cc.

DOCTOR X513
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X513
Every evening.

DOCTOR X513
Okay and do you check your sugars?

PATIENT X513
Every now and then.

DOCTOR X513
Okay.  So um I would like for you to check your sugars more regularly.  Anytime anybody's on insulin we got to just check them a little bit more frequently.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
Okay.  Um when you do check them what do you think they run?

PATIENT X513
You was gonna say something.  Oh well anywhere from uh 140, 150, up to maybe 160, or 70.

DOCTOR X513
Okay.  Any lows, have you felt low?

PATIENT X513
Uh when I first got to the hospital I was getting some 80s and 70s.

DOCTOR X513
Okay and you felt it then huh.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
Okay, okay, the 140s to 150s, low 70s, alrighty.  Okay now the last number we had on you, do you know what an A1c is?

PATIENT X513
No.

DOCTOR X513
Okay so instead of, so what an A1c is this new measure that we have for the last couple of years uh to check on patients with diabetes.  It's a test that we check in your blood and they checked it in your blood when you were in the hospital and it gives you kind of like an average reading over the three months.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
When you just prick your finger it's just really.

PATIENT X513
Right.

DOCTOR X513
Kind of what you eat, what time of day it is, what medicines you're on but this one gives us an average for over three months okay and for every diabetic their goal is less than 7 okay.  For you, yours was 7.3.  So close but not close yeah.

PATIENT X513
Still a little bit high.

DOCTOR X513
Yeah so um I think since they put you on that regimen of insulin we have to just wait a couple of months right, to see if it's really taking effect.  Which is fine you know.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
Which is okay so we'll just have you check in a couple of months and see how that's going.  Now um issue number two is you had a history of high blood pressure right.  Yes.

PATIENT X513
Well I didn't have a history but I did develop a history.

DOCTOR X513
Okay @@@. Um and right now we have you on metoprolol 75 mg a day right?

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
Um the lisinopril 10 mg a day okay.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
And you're taking all those?  You don't miss a dose?

PATIENT X513
Right.

DOCTOR X513
Okay good, you're close enough to where I wouldn't change anything about it.  You're 134, 133 so that's good enough for me.  Um do you check your blood pressure at home?  Do you have a blood pressure cuff?

PATIENT X513
I have one.  I haven't been using it cause I'm in the hospital.

DOCTOR X513
You didn't do it yourself cause we're checking it for you.

PATIENT X513
And plus every, there's a woman who comes in and she does it.

DOCTOR X513
Oh good.  What has it been running when she does it?

PATIENT X513
Uh 160, 120s, 130s.

DOCTOR X513
So that kind ranges in the low one okay, okay.  We're okay now so I don't want to do too much so that's okay and then last week we started you on another one for your cholesterol right?

PATIENT X513
Yeah.

DOCTOR X513
The simvastatin.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
Okay good so let's keep going with that.  You're not having any muscle pain.

SECOND PERSON X513
I think he needs some more of the cholesterol.

DOCTOR X513
Just we'll @@@.

SECOND PERSON X513
Okay.

DOCTOR X513
And then are you taking a baby aspirin?

PATIENT X513
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X513
Yeah.

DOCTOR X513
A baby aspirin.  Okay, um so a couple people we got to get you hooked up with okay.  Um one is a cardiologist okay.

PATIENT X513
The cardiovascular people?

DOCTOR X513
Not the vascular people but the.

PATIENT X513
Oh I'm saying that because the Podiatry people.

DOCTOR X513
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X513

DOCTOR X513
If you need to see the Vascular Clinic yes.

PATIENT X513

DOCTOR X513
Yes you do and we can get you in to see them too okay and when was the last time you checked your eyes to see if the diabetes?

PATIENT X513

PATIENT X513

DOCTOR X513
Okay fine, we can get you in to see them.

PATIENT X513

DOCTOR X513

PATIENT X513
It hurt so bad.

DOCTOR X513

PATIENT X513
So I stopped it.

DOCTOR X513
Oh no, we can see if there's something else we can do.  Um and then just a second, next is your colonoscopy.  Do you remember having one of those done?

PATIENT X513
Oh I've had a lot of those done in the past.

DOCTOR X513
In the past and when was the last one do you think?

PATIENT X513
Oh it's been quite a while.

DOCTOR X513
Okay.

PATIENT X513
I haven't ever had it done here.

DOCTOR X513
Yeah.  I think we said in our last note that you had it done about eight years ago.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X513
About a year ago so about nine years ago and then we tried to bring up some records from Mercy.

PATIENT X513
Yeah now Mercy, I went by there.  Mercy said after ten years they get rid of all their records.

DOCTOR X513
Okay, well is a colonoscopy something you want, well we recommend it for anybody between the age of 50 and 75 we recommend you get a colonoscopy and if it's been that long.

PATIENT X513
Okay.

DOCTOR X513
It would probably be about time again, is that okay?

PATIENT X513
I can do it yeah.

DOCTOR X513

Okay that's fine um we just wanted to make sure that that was being looked at but.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X513

SECOND DOCTOR X513
Okay take care, alright.

PATIENT X513
Thank you for stopping in.

SECOND DOCTOR X513
Okay sure.

PATIENT X513
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
So a couple of changes we're gonna make.  So for the diabetes, uh we think that you're actually overall doing pretty good.  I think we could just fine tune it just a little bit.

PATIENT X513
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
So instead of taking the 10 units, if you want to bump it up just a little bit to the 12 okay.

PATIENT X513
12 okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
And we'll see how it is.  We can check your sugars.  I want you to start checking your sugars more regularly at home okay.  So if you want to check it up, you know, mostly like five times out of the week you check it before.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
In the mornings or something you know before you eat anything and then a couple of times a week check it uh about an hour or so or two hours after you eat okay.

PATIENT X513
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
So that we can see both what we've got and in three months when you come back to see me, I want you to probably have your sugars redone okay.

PATIENT X513
Ahead of time okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
Now if you find that you're going to low, cut back you know, try 11 units.  If that's not helping then go back to 10 okay.

PATIENT X513
Right and it's such a small difference.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
I know.  I know.  But its, but for you it might be a bigger difference.

PATIENT X513
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
Because you're not that heavy you know.

PATIENT X513
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
So that makes a little bit more fine tuned okay.

PATIENT X513
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
And we'll get you back in to see our eye doctor.  Let's see when the last time we had you see them last um.

PATIENT X513
I know it's been at least four months, five months.

SECOND PERSON X513
Almost a year.

PATIENT X513

SECOND PERSON X513
No it's been almost a year.  It was in the summertime when you had it done.

PATIENT X513

FIRST DOCTOR X513
Well I'm glad you think that was fun.  I don't know about that.  But yeah we'll get you back in to see them.

PATIENT X513
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
And we'll get you back to see the Eye Clinic so let's do that.  We're going to increase that to 12 okay and that's it for the diabetes okay.  So next is for your heart and your blood pressure.  So with your heart condition that we were talking about your blood pressure could be just a little bit lower and it would be better okay.

PATIENT X513
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
Not too crazy but just a little lower so we wanted to you know that lisinopril that you're on, so you're taking like half a tablet right?

SECOND PERSON X513
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
We want you to go ahead and take a full tablet of it okay.  so it'll be one tablet.

PATIENT X513
That's one tablet, one full on that one.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
Yes a full one.

PATIENT X513
And for the other one I'm already taking 1 1/2.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
Yeah.  That one you leave just as it.

PATIENT X513
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X513
You leave that one just as is okay.  So we'll increase that one for you um and then next is we want to get you in to see our cardiologists okay.

PATIENT X513

FIRST DOCTOR X513

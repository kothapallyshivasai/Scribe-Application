That's because I just don't have no cartilage in there anymore.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah.  Did you have a procedure there or not, I don't remember.

DOCTOR X226
Done, you're list is short.

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
For most of my patients it's long.

PATIENT X226
My one woman doctor down there is the one that told me I'd pickled myself @@@.

DOCTOR X226

PATIENT X226
I'm embalming myself.

DOCTOR X226

DOCTOR X226
You’re going to follow up with the GI guys for the scope.

PATIENT X226

DOCTOR X226
And you're going do the liver, um you're going to do the Mental Health and you're going to do the.

PATIENT X226

DOCTOR X226
GI and Liver are going to do their part.  So you have to do that one.

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
So hopefully three upcoming things to do.

PATIENT X226
Alright.

DOCTOR X226
Okay.  We'll refill the hydrochlorothiazide.  I'm going to check with my attending about changing the new one for the meloxicam since it's not working.  

PATIENT X226
The knee right here, I've had them look at it, there's no cartilage left in the knee now.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah bone on bone.

PATIENT X226
What it does, you know it just pops every now and then and I hear it pop.  It's not doing it right now but.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah.  How's the winter been for you, you haven't gotten sick at all or anything like that?

PATIENT X226
Nope.

DOCTOR X226
Open your mouth and say ah for me.

PATIENT X226
Ah.

DOCTOR X226
You a Bears fan?

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
We stopped them.

PATIENT X226
But I knew xxx xxx was going to kick your ass man, I just knew it.

DOCTOR X226
Well what do you think about NAME, what do you think about that whole thing?

PATIENT X226
He's getting the shaft I think.

DOCTOR X226
Do you think?

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
Do you think they told him to not come in?

PATIENT X226
Well not only that but you know it's not all his fault man.  We need an offense to do anything.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah.

PATIENT X226
You know.  And then once the doc tells you you can't go in, you ain't going in and you know.

DOCTOR X226
@@@.

PATIENT X226
@@@ not to you know.

DOCTOR X226
You don't think he @@@.

PATIENT X226
Well yeah he did I think, I mean I do, but maybe next year.

DOCTOR X226
I just don't like his attitude.

PATIENT X226
Well he bums everybody out you know.

DOCTOR X226
That's the problem.  

PATIENT X226
He sat on that bench and pissed everyone off, you know.

DOCTOR X226
You know and that's not a good quarterback.

PATIENT X226
No.

DOCTOR X226
That's not a member of the team.  Deep breath, breathe out, breathe in, again.  Good.  Lay back for me.  You don't notice any water in your legs or anything?

PATIENT X226
No.

DOCTOR X226
All in all, he just, you can sit up.  @@@.

PATIENT X226
I know.

DOCTOR X226
I just don't like his attitude.

PATIENT X226
Yeah @@@.  You know he's shown that a few times already too you know.  That's where uh.

DOCTOR X226
And then he thinks he's getting the shaft but I think part of the time the problem @@@ by the way he carries himself.

PATIENT X226
Yeah I mean they say he's soft but I don't know where the ACL is in the knee, I imagine it hurts.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah but, Roethlisberger played on a broken foot.

PATIENT X226
Yeah I mean look at all @@@.

DOCTOR X226
NAME would have come in with his arm in a sling okay.

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
You know.

PATIENT X226
Then they really messed up when they put that second quarterback NAME.  They should have put NAME in for him.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah.  Um.

PATIENT X226
But the offense really sucks; we got to get an offense.

DOCTOR X226
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X226
A little bit yeah, I'm down to less than, well about a pack a day now.

DOCTOR X226
So what, what do you want?  Do you a patch or do you want the gum or do you want?

PATIENT X226
I can't chew gum I got dentures.

DOCTOR X226
How about the patch?

PATIENT X226
The patch I tried but it didn't work.  @@@.  You said you wanted to give me two of them @@@.  I'd probably be able to do the gum @@@.

DOCTOR X226
Well let me know which do you want, do you want to try to do it yourself and then if it doesn't work let me know?

PATIENT X226
Yeah.  Let's do that, you know I'm managing to quit all my other shit and.

DOCTOR X226
Okay.  So let's do that.

PATIENT X226
I'm down, I mean I was smoking about 2 1/2 packs and I'm down to.

DOCTOR X226
Good.

PATIENT X226
Oh yeah.  About a pack, little less than a pack a day now.

DOCTOR X226
Okay.

PATIENT X226
And I can't smoke at home cause my girls won't let me smoke in the house.

DOCTOR X226
Those are good girls.

PATIENT X226
Other than that, I don’t know, every thing has been okay.

DOCTOR X226
I was looking at your lab results and your liver function is a little high, @@@.

PATIENT X226
You when I talked to NAME she said I got a little bit of scarring down there.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah you do.  @@@.

PATIENT X226
What's that?

DOCTOR X226
It is going up @@@ 120, 130.  One the enzymes in your liver.

PATIENT X226
Oh.

DOCTOR X226
So you know.

PATIENT X226
Is it still doing it now?

DOCTOR X226
Yeah the last time they checked it was in June of 10 and it was 120 and now January 11 it's 159, so.

PATIENT X226
That's not good huh?

DOCTOR X226
Not great but I mean the rest of your liver enzymes look pretty good.

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
So that's good.

PATIENT X226
@@@ good news right.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah it is.  Hang on, so we'll see.  We'll see what they say.  Let me go check with my attending real quick uh.  

PATIENT X226
So you think you are going to get hold of Mental Health or am I?

DOCTOR X226
I think you are.

PATIENT X226
I need to go downstairs to I think don't I.  So I can make an appointment with them.

DOCTOR X226
Usually all you need is @@@.

PATIENT X226
Oh yeah, well years ago back in the 70s I was tested on @@@ infections that I had but now they don't take it anymore do they?

DOCTOR X226
@@@.

PATIENT X226
They don't, there's no claim for it anymore and they don't test for it anymore do they?

DOCTOR X226
They don't.

PATIENT X226
Not that I know of.  Cause I've always wanted to fight them on that cause my daughter's missing her five fingers on her one hand.

DOCTOR X226
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X226
You know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X226
Okay let me go ask him about the Mental Health and the meloxicam.

PATIENT X226
Okay doc.

DOCTOR X226
And @@@.

PATIENT X226
Sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  52:04  DOCTOR IN:  60:35)

DOCTOR X226
Hey, okay.  So well this is done.

PATIENT X226
What's that the meloxicam shit, @@@.

DOCTOR X226
In your knee?

PATIENT X226
@@@.

DOCTOR X226
It can be.  So here's what @@@.  We could do @@@ I think you should probably see PT again for your knee because strengthening the muscles surrounding your knee is the best way to support your knee and decrease the pain um.  You saw them once before right?

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
When was the last time, it's been a while ago right?

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
Would you be interested in doing that or no?  

PATIENT X226
@@@ I mean yeah like you say if I do exercises you don't need to put @@@.

DOCTOR X226
Right.

PATIENT X226
Because putting in a new kneecap is probably not something they're going to do.

DOCTOR X226
So what do you think?

PATIENT X226
Uh I guess I'll give it a try.

DOCTOR X226
Alright.  So I'll do PT and then have you ever tried that capsaicin cream?

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
Has it worked for you?

PATIENT X226
No.

DOCTOR X226
Not at all?  How long did you use it for?  @@@.  You should give it about a month for it to work.

PATIENT X226
Oh yea?  No only used it for a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR X226
Do you want to try it again?

PATIENT X226
Sure.

DOCTOR X226
And the problem is that after like much beyond this, the next thing we do is Vicodin or like narcotics and we @@@.

PATIENT X226
They don't want to give me Vicodin.

DOCTOR X226
But you know what I mean that's the problem.

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226
You know we're kind of running into a brick wall.

PATIENT X226
Yeah that's fine.  I mean I can deal with it.  The only thing is it's hard getting up and down.

DOCTOR X226
Well I'll write you for capsaicin, I'll write you for meloxicam again I'll just refill it.  The trazodone I'm going to let the Mental Health do that so cause um that way you just go see them and you need to make an appointment, it's been less than two years since you've seen them, so just call.

PATIENT X226
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X226
So you need to call.

PATIENT X226
GI guys.

DOCTOR X226
GI guys and.

PATIENT X226
The Mental Health.

DOCTOR X226
Mental Health and Liver is going to make your appointment for you.

PATIENT X226
Alright.

DOCTOR X226
And then I will put in the lipid profile and CBC in the computer.

PATIENT X226
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X226
And um get those when you've been fasting for 12 hours so that we can do those to check a cholesterol.  So.

PATIENT X226
Okay.

DOCTOR X226
Okay.

PATIENT X226
Oh give blood okay.

DOCTOR X226
Blood.  So those will be in the computer next time you're around.

PATIENT X226
Get those done.

DOCTOR X226
And then um that's it.

PATIENT X226
Cool.

DOCTOR X226
I'll see you like six months unless something changes.

PATIENT X226
@@@.

DOCTOR X226
Yeah that'll work.  Are you going to be here sooner?

PATIENT X226

DOCTOR X226
You can do whatever you want.

PATIENT X226
Yeah.

DOCTOR X226

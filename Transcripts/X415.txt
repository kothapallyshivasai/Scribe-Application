PATIENT X415
I went through the MRI, I went @@@.

DOCTOR X415
Yeah I know I believe you.  They're showing an MRI of your cervical spine in November but I'm not seeing an MRI of your knee but I know you've had it done.

PATIENT X415
No, it's not for the knee.  They scheduled that.

DOCTOR X415
That might be sitting here.

PATIENT X415

PATIENT X415
No, not really, usually I don't use it.

DOCTOR X415
Okay and you haven't seen anyone since you saw me last in December right?

PATIENT X415
No except for that, for the MRI.

DOCTOR X415
For the MRI you're right.  Alright so you missed your appointment in October and then you came back huh.  So you missed your MRI back in October and never rescheduled it.  That's yeah, that's what happened.

PATIENT X415
Right okay.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  Alright now we got that taken care of.  So you've been having spasms with your knee and it's not getting any better.

PATIENT X415

Has it gotten any worse?

PATIENT X415
No, no.

DOCTOR X415
Okay are you having any numbness or tingling?

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
No.

PATIENT X415
The only thing happened; the only thing that really happened is that I have to position myself a certain way in bed, especially when I relax okay.

DOCTOR X415
Right.

PATIENT X415
And then if I don't what happens is that it seems like, it seem like there's a press.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.

PATIENT X415
That comes not just in one space.

DOCTOR X415
Right.

PATIENT X415
And then when I lay it goes up.

DOCTOR X415
Alright, right cause that's what we were talking about last time.

PATIENT X415
Right.

DOCTOR X415
But you aren't having any falls or anything right?

PATIENT X415
No uh uh no.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.

PATIENT X415
And it happens in both legs.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  The last time I saw you did it just happened in the one?  Or does it move at all cause last time it was just your right knee.

PATIENT X415
No it's both the knees.

DOCTOR X415
It's in both yeah.

PATIENT X415
It's just that the right knee was worse.

DOCTOR X415
Okay than the left.

PATIENT X415
Yeah.

DOCTOR X415
Okay and your blood pressure's in really good control so that's good and you had your colonoscopy and the colon was another we covered and you're still following with the urologist.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  Uh have you had your flu shot this year?

DOCTOR X415
Not gonna take that huh.

PATIENT X415

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  I've heard some mixed reviews about it.  A lot of my patients want to take it and some people absolutely not.

PATIENT X415
I'm not gonna get it.

DOCTOR X415
Okay and then you need another colonoscopy but you wanted to wait until next year.

PATIENT X415
Yes.

DOCTOR X415
Okay so we can schedule you for that next year, cause it's almost 2010.

PATIENT X415

DOCTOR X415
Um let's see if your lipids.

PATIENT X415
I want you to look at something here.

DOCTOR X415
Sure.

PATIENT X415
My back, lift that up.  My wife keeps telling me that behind my neck here.

DOCTOR X415
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X415
Right here, there's a knot, I feel that there's a knot right there.

DOCTOR X415
Well there's one right here.

PATIENT X415
Now I'm not talking about the uh mole.

DOCTOR X415
The thing on your, right cause that's been there for a while.

PATIENT X415
Yeah.

DOCTOR X415
Alright take your jacket off cause your collar's in the way.  Take you're jacket off, I can't see your eyes.  Sit over here.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

DOCTOR X415
You haven't been having any chest pain, trouble breathing, nausea, vomiting, blood in your stool?  

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
I'm gonna look at you.  We're @@@.

PATIENT X415
@@@ I think I'm cheating when I move my leg here.

DOCTOR X415
Let me see.  Oh it's right there.

PATIENT X415
I think that's where it's at.  I can't see behind me.

DOCTOR X415
No that's actually your skull.  Cause you've got such thin, cause you're bald up here essentially.

PATIENT X415
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X415
You don't have enough hair so it's the same on both sides.

PATIENT X415
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X415
You've got it symmetrical when we start getting concerned is when you like let's say you had a bump over here but you didn't over here.

PATIENT X415
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X415
Then I may be concerned but they're both exactly the same size.  They're the same as far as depth.  They're not tender right?

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
And you know they're not nodules they're just like the outline of your skull.

PATIENT X415
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  If this was all of a sudden, @@@ as a doctor it's not anything to be concerned about okay.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

DOCTOR X415
I believe @@@ I'll have you come up here.

PATIENT X415
I can do that.

DOCTOR X415
Okay look straight ahead for me.  Open your mouth, stick out your tongue and say ah.

PATIENT X415
Ah.

DOCTOR X415
Good.  You seeing me alright?

PATIENT X415
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X415
Take a big deep breath in and out through your mouth.  One more, last one.  Did we ever have you go see Orthopedic Surgery or anything for your knee for the stabbing in your knee that you're having or physical therapy or anything like that?  No.  Cause that might be the next step that because you're having trouble.  You haven't lost your balance or fallen or anything so right?  You just kind of like when you're laying in bed you've got to lay in a certain position and remember just not like to jerk back.

PATIENT X415
It does jerk back.

DOCTOR X415
Yeah.

PATIENT X415
It spasms.

DOCTOR X415
It spasms.

PATIENT X415
It's like the same thing that I had here in my neck.

DOCTOR X415
With your neck.

PATIENT X415
And when I had that my whole shoulder could change.

DOCTOR X415
Yeah.

PATIENT X415
And that's the way it is right here um.

DOCTOR X415
Does it hurt when I'm pushing right here?

PATIENT X415
No, no, no.

DOCTOR X415
It doesn't hurt at all.

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
It spasms.

PATIENT X415
That's all.

DOCTOR X415
Any leg swelling?

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
Does it happen like at a certain of day or it kind of can happen at any time?

PATIENT X415
If one goes up, nothing I'm doing.

DOCTOR X415
It doesn't wake you up at night does it?

PATIENT X415
Yeah.

DOCTOR X415
It does.

PATIENT X415
Yes.

DOCTOR X415
Sometimes you wake up having leg spasms.

PATIENT X415
Oh man, it just, I've had it come up my legs going back to my back.

DOCTOR X415
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X415
And my wife sometime has to get up.

DOCTOR X415
@@@ and help you out?

PATIENT X415
And pull my legs.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.

PATIENT X415
Pull my legs up you know.

DOCTOR X415
Yeah.

PATIENT X415
And the only thing that helps me.

DOCTOR X415
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X415
@@@.

DOCTOR X415
That helps with the spasms?

PATIENT X415
Yeah it releases, releases it.

DOCTOR X415
Okay, okay.  So lay down for me.  Cause it doesn't sound like you're really having pain, it sounds more like you're just having spasms.

PATIENT X415
That's what it is.

DOCTOR X415
Alright.  I'm gonna lift your leg up, you tell me if it hurts anywhere.

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
No.

PATIENT X415
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X415
No.  Now can you bend your knee for me?

PATIENT X415
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X415
Put your foot down.  I'm just gonna push a little bit.  You tell me if you feel any pain.

PATIENT X415
Just pressure.

DOCTOR X415
Just pressure.  Go ahead and sit back up.  You need some help?

PATIENT X415
Why?

DOCTOR X415
I need some help sitting up.  Let me see what else we mentioned.  And you said you haven't ever had trauma to that knee or anything like that?

PATIENT X415
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X415
Alright, well let me go talk to DOCTOR, see what she thinks um and we'll go from there.

PATIENT X415
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

DOCTOR X415
Um and the last time I saw you, you had a UTI, a urinary tract infection.

PATIENT X415
Right.

DOCTOR X415
Do you uh.

PATIENT X415
That's cleared.

DOCTOR X415
That's cleared up.  You haven't had another one since then right?

PATIENT X415
Right.

DOCTOR X415
And you're still, so last time we talked about your prostate cancer screening and you said you don't want to get screened anymore because?

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
If you found it you didn't want to do anything about it right?

PATIENT X415
No I didn't say that.

DOCTOR X415
You didn't say that okay.  That was one of the notes from before I saw you so um; do you want to get screened?

PATIENT X415
I don't need to get screened for the prostate.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  Um I just wanted to make sure.  Cause some of my patients also say well I'm not gonna do anything about it so I don't want to be screened and I say okay, it's up to you.  Um I had one other question oh, your blood pressure.  You don't have a blood pressure cuff at home do you or do you have one?

PATIENT X415
I have, you know what I dropped it.

DOCTOR X415
You dropped it.  Do you need a new one?

PATIENT X415
Will it cost me?

DOCTOR X415
I do not know.  That I do not know.  I can put in the order and you can find out cause they can give it to you at Prosthetics and you can ask them if it's gonna cost anything.

PATIENT X415
Cause I dropped it and uh.

DOCTOR X415
Well the other thing you can do if you dropped it you can bring it back in, they might be able to exchange it for another one.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

DOCTOR X415
If you still have it unless you threw it away.

PATIENT X415
I haven't been using it too much now.

DOCTOR X415
Yeah.

PATIENT X415
@@@.

DOCTOR X415
Well your blood pressure's good today so that's good.  The other thing is there's free blood pressure cuffs and things like Walgreens and xxx and things like that so you could actually go there and get it done but if you have one at home I'd like you to you know, especially if you get lightheaded, dizzy or anything like that I want you to check your blood pressure and make sure it's not too low okay.  And you're still taking your amlodipine?

PATIENT X415
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X415
And that's the only medication we have you on.  Are you on any aspirin?

PATIENT X415
Uh I don't take the aspirins ever day.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  Okay.  Yeah actually it was in the Urology Note, the urologist you saw said that you mentioned to them that you, if they, you probably wouldn't want further intervention.

PATIENT X415
That means I get off the list.

DOCTOR X415
Perfect.  I will put that in my notes then.

PATIENT X415
Yeah.

DOCTOR X415
Um when was the last time you saw Urology?  Do remember?

PATIENT X415
@@@.

DOCTOR X415
(Laughter) Uh it looks like it was September of this year.

PATIENT X415
September yeah.

DOCTOR X415
Yeah right before you saw me.

PATIENT X415
Right.  I wanted to say that but I wasn't sure.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  Alright.  Give me a minute and I'll go talk to DOCTOR and you need refills today?

PATIENT X415
I only take that one prescription from you and that's not.

DOCTOR X415
And the aspirin.

PATIENT X415
To and that I go through CVS.

DOCTOR X415
Do you get the aspirin?

PATIENT X415
No just uh, I got it all.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.

PATIENT X415
And it only costs me $7 a prescription.

DOCTOR X415
Really.

PATIENT X415
And it costs the same thing here.

DOCTOR X415
Alright.

PATIENT X415
There's uh, I would like to have though a prescription for ibuprofen but what they gave me for @@@.

DOCTOR X415
Motrin?

PATIENT X415
I think it was the @@@ milligrams.

DOCTOR X415
The biggest milligrams of ibuprofen?

PATIENT X415
Yeah.

DOCTOR X415
Well the maximum dose of ibuprofen.

PATIENT X415
Yeah what is the maximum dose?

DOCTOR X415
We wouldn't recommend.  I don't recommend.

PATIENT X415
What do you recommend?  Just put me on that.

DOCTOR X415
So well, though you're, what do you want to do.  You want the ibuprofen for your knee but you said your knee is not getting any pain it's just the.

PATIENT X415
So what do you recommend.

DOCTOR X415
Between the max and the middle?

PATIENT X415
xxx.

DOCTOR X415
Well it depends on your kidney function.  I'm going to have to look into your labs and things.  It could relieve and you want it for your knee?

PATIENT X415
Yes.

DOCTOR X415
Are you having pain anywhere else?

PATIENT X415
Sometimes in your back.

DOCTOR X415
Sometimes in your back.

PATIENT X415
Right now I got pain in my back when I lay down there at night.

DOCTOR X415
Okay cause ibuprofen you can buy over-the-counter.

PATIENT X415
Yes but I want to get the full milligrams @@@.

DOCTOR X415
Right, right.

PATIENT X415
I'm doing that.

DOCTOR X415
So because I just have a hard time with you taking too much of it either.

PATIENT X415
I don't take too much of it either.

DOCTOR X415
Okay, okay.  I can give you a prescription for ibuprofen.

PATIENT X415
But what milligram?

DOCTOR X415
Well I'll give you; I'll give you a prescription for a lower dose and then you can increase it and I'll put on there what the maximum dose is.

PATIENT X415
What's the maximum dose you're gonna give me?

DOCTOR X415
Well let me see what the maximum dose of ibuprofen would be through the VA okay.  8, eight pills or 800?

PATIENT X415
800.

DOCTOR X415
800, I don't know.

PATIENT X415
I take them.

DOCTOR X415
You take them.  Is that how much you've been taking, that's 800 a day?

PATIENT X415
No.

DOCTOR X415
800 sometimes or?

PATIENT X415
Maybe three pills of 800 mg a day.

DOCTOR X415
Oh.

PATIENT X415
I take @@@.

DOCTOR X415
@@@ for your back and for your knee?  Well I guess I could do that for you.

PATIENT X415
@@@.

DOCTOR X415
Okay.  Give me a minute I'll visit with DOCTOR.

(DOCTOR OUT:  84:41  DOCTOR IN 89:00)

SECOND DOCTOR X415
Hey PATIENT.

PATIENT X415
How you doing DOCTOR?

SECOND DOCTOR X415
How are you?

PATIENT X415
Doing good thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR X415
Alright so um uh how's your breathing?

PATIENT X415
It's.

SECOND DOCTOR X415
You don't use any inhalers anymore?  You don't smoke anymore either?

PATIENT X415
I ain't smoked in 25 years.

SECOND DOCTOR X415
Alright.  So.

PATIENT X415
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X415
In terms of the okay so I don't know what happened to the order we made for the knee.  You got the MRI of your neck but not the knee so we'll make that order again, have you make an appointment and see the orthopedic doctors after.

PATIENT X415
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR X415
Alright.

PATIENT X415
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X415
Well you can go up today and make an appointment for the MRI.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

DOCTOR X415
But you should see the orthopedic doctors after the MRI is done.

PATIENT X415
Uh-huh, alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X415
And then we'll just.

PATIENT X415
What do I do right now?

FIRST DOCTOR X415
That's what we'll tell you.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Alright sir.  So here's what we're gonna do right now.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
I want you to do three things for me.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
I want you to go up front when you leave here, schedule an appointment with Orthopedics.  I want you to schedule it, well actually you know what, before you do that, I take it back I'll refill your meds.  So what I want you to do, the first thing I want you to go across the hall to the MRI um place where they schedule the MRIs, schedule your MRI because the order, that's why I was getting confused cause the MRI I put in is not in there anymore because it got cancelled and never got rescheduled.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
So I want you to get an MRI of your knees so you need @@@ for both knees okay.  After you get that date of that MRI I want you to come back up here to the front and ask them up front to schedule you for an appointment with the orthopedic surgeons for an appointment after your MRI.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
And then also I want you to follow up with the urologist because you haven't been there in a while and from their last note it seems like there's some confusion about what they wanted and what you want to do so I want you to go talk to them about what exactly the plan should be that fits back with what you want and with what they want okay.  And yeah I'll write it all down for you so you know what to do in what order.  Um also you have, you wanted the ibuprofen.  There's another medication I want you to try as well called salsalate.  

PATIENT X415
I'm not a medication man.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
I know you're not, I know you're not.  I want you to try this instead of the ibuprofen.  I'll give you a prescription for both but I want you to try the salsalate first cause I think it might work a little bit better.

PATIENT X415
Is it a pill?

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Salsalate okay and if that doesn't work then you try the ibuprofen.  I'll give you prescriptions for both okay.

PATIENT X415
Same price?

FIRST DOCTOR X415
It's VA meds I have no idea.  Ask the Pharmacy when you get over there.  If it's a problem you come back here and ask me okay.  Um let me write down the order of things that you need to do.  @@@.

PATIENT X415
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Okay.  Go do the MRI, schedule these appointments and then I will see you.  When do you want to see me again?

PATIENT X415
Hmm, well let's find out what date.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
I want to see you after all these are done.

PATIENT X415
That's what I say just wait until we see the date.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
So I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you 30 tablets of ibuprofen.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Okay and with that many pills but I don't want you taking too many of them.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
And then the salsalate I gave you.

PATIENT X415
Now what is this?

FIRST DOCTOR X415
It's a pain medication as well and make sure you take it with food or with milk or something cause it can cause @@@.

PATIENT X415
But I can't take it too.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Don't take both of them at the same time.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Okay um but see if that, see if that helps as well okay.

PATIENT X415
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Just for pain.  I mean if you're having pain occasionally, like I said I don't like giving you that many medications.  I don't want you to be taking too many meds cause they all have side effects.  They can cause ulcers and things like that and I don't want that so.  What I'd like for you to do is only take them if you absolutely need them and these aren't working you come back and hopefully we'll get some more information with the MRI and then we'll go from there.  Okay.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
And then I will, I won't reschedule you for the next few months cause I think you @@@.

PATIENT X415
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
This is December so like March?

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Then we can see you in March @@@.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
And if something really abnormal comes up with this MRI, if something really abnormal comes with the MRI I'll give you a call and I want to give you the phone number, let me put this in first.  Alright give me one second I just want to schedule this before you go because it's not in the computer.

PATIENT X415
I'm not in a hurry, just take your time.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Alright.  And we'll put in the consult cause you've never seen the orthopedic surgeons before have you?

PATIENT X415
No.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Okay I'll put in that consult and they'll schedule it for you.  Okay so the consult is in for your appointment with the orthopedic surgeon.  They'll just give you a call because they will set it up for you and um uh with the MRI appointment they'll go over everything as well.

PATIENT X415
So get the MRI.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
Uh-huh.  Schedule it, here's what you're gonna do.  Schedule MRI and then schedule your appointment okay.  I want to get your phone number real quick.

PATIENT X415
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X415
In case I need to call you, okay is it PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT X415
That's it.

FIRST DOCTOR X415

PATIENT X415

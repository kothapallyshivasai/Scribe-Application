But the thing was, at the beginning of the year January her whole hospital changed from HMO, Blue Cross Blue Shield to Aetna.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.

PATIENT X718
And they dropped me.

DOCTOR X718
Oh so now you're coming here okay.  So were you looking at something.

PATIENT X718
I generally, I used to come out here all the time and see DOCTOR in Rheumatology.

DOCTOR X718
Gotcha.  You're on insulin.  Do you know how much insulin you're taking?

PATIENT X718
Hmm no I don't.

DOCTOR X718
Now do you get your medications from here or um?

PATIENT X718
Mostly I get them here.

DOCTOR X718
Good.  When were you at St. xxx's?

PATIENT X718
Uh like January the 10th or somewhere around there.

DOCTOR X718
Okay and what was it for?

PATIENT X718
Um I was one morning at home and I had water on my lungs, I couldn't catch my breath.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.

PATIENT X718
So my wife took me to the nearest hospital which is St. xxx's.  I live in Dawson.

DOCTOR X718
Okay and you've never had this happen before right?

PATIENT X718
No uh I'm taking dialysis now and uh I went to St. xxx out in xxx xxx.  They gave me a pacemaker.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.

PATIENT X718
And I'm taking uh dialysis.  They just put a stent in my arm so I can take it in my arm and not in my hip.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  When was that?

PATIENT X718
Uh the stent was put in two Tuesdays ago and the Pharmacy won't fill the prescription unless I see my doctor first.

DOCTOR X718
Uh-huh, okay.  @@@.  Did you get a biopsy done?

PATIENT X718
I was scheduled to have it done but I'm already on dialysis @@@.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  Just reading up on the hospitalization.

PATIENT X718
Okay.

DOCTOR X718
Did you get an echocardiogram done here?

PATIENT X718
I had one done the last time I was in the hospital here.

DOCTOR X718
So was it here?

PATIENT X718
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X718
Let's look.  So from here on out would you start having your primary care doctor here or would it be outside?

PATIENT X718
Uh my primary doctor's always been out here I just used her insurance card because she didn't want to travel.

DOCTOR X718
Right.

PATIENT X718
We live in Dalton a far south suburb so.

DOCTOR X718
I understand.

PATIENT X718
So she didn't want to drive all the way over here to get me in Emergency here.

DOCTOR X718
No I understand.

PATIENT X718
As long as I feel pretty decent now, I always bring myself here.

DOCTOR X718
Hmm.  Um any recent shortness of breath or that's good okay.

PATIENT X718
I don't even know where I'm at.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  There you go then.  So you had that done in November at least.  Since they diagnosed you is it much better?

PATIENT X718
That changed @@@.

DOCTOR X718
They did?

PATIENT X718
Yeah that's why they put the new pacemaker in here.

DOCTOR X718
What did they say was your um ejection fraction?  Do you remember that?

PATIENT X718
No sir.

DOCTOR X718
Now is that a pacemaker or a defibrillator?

PATIENT X718
Oh.

DOCTOR X718
Do you have card with you?  Great.  

PATIENT X718
Does it tell you which one it is?

DOCTOR X718
Um I got to look this up and all.  Um when was this placed?

PATIENT X718
Uh December the 23rd.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  They said that you had a slower heart rate during the hospitalization.

PATIENT X718
Right.

DOCTOR X718
Oh a slow heartbeat.

PATIENT X718
That's it.

DOCTOR X718
So that's what we're looking at.  You have some documents over here, do you know?

PATIENT X718
Um there was a problem with me getting an appointment.

DOCTOR X718
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X718
They kept putting me back in March and then it was April and I bet they haven't really sent any of my records in there.

DOCTOR X718
Now would the dialysis be on the same records as this?

PATIENT X718
Yes that was on the same monitor the fistula.  This was done at St. xxx.

DOCTOR X718
Hmm.

PATIENT X718
And I was asking them well why did they put it in my chest they said cause I had to have it right away, I got to start doing dialysis right away.

DOCTOR X718
For the dialysis okay.

PATIENT X718
So they put the fistula in and said in about three or four weeks when this gets well.

DOCTOR X718
So let's say in a month how many times have you been hospitalized?

PATIENT X718
Uh last year was the most in my life.

DOCTOR X718
Yeah.

PATIENT X718
I think it was about four times.

DOCTOR X718
Okay so let's, I find that I uh you know @@@ things would happen so you know as of, in November you weren't on dialysis right.  You didn't have the pacemaker, you didn't have okay.

PATIENT X718
I been doing dialysis till December.

DOCTOR X718

PATIENT X718

DOCTOR X718
So at St. xxx.

PATIENT X718

DOCTOR X718
Uh they said that your kidneys weren't really working right?

PATIENT X718
Yes that's what it was there.  I know they took a lot of blood and uh then they said I have kidney failure they said it's kicking on and off.

DOCTOR X718
Yeah.

PATIENT X718
But it's supposed to work 24 hours a day but it wasn't so.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.

PATIENT X718
They put me on the dialysis right away.

DOCTOR X718
So the dialysis.

PATIENT X718
And I felt better.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.

PATIENT X718
Then in January I was at home.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  So you were able to get the dialysis.

PATIENT X718
Right.

DOCTOR X718

PATIENT X718
No I'd rather be out there, it's closer to home.

DOCTOR X718

Okay.  Alright so this is three hospitalizations that we're talking about since November okay.

PATIENT X718

PATIENT X718

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:22  DOCTOR IN:  60:56)

DOCTOR X718
Hey.  So I'd like to get a couple of things.  @@@ this medication list.

PATIENT X718
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X718
Were you getting your medications at the other hospitals or were you always getting your medications here?

PATIENT X718
I was always getting them here.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  Um because some of these were expired so I don't know if you were still taking them or not.  What I want to do um, yeah instead of refilling everything what are the things that you.

PATIENT X718
Those are the things I need right there on the basic list.

DOCTOR X718
Yeah I think that you have refills for most of them.

PATIENT X718
Right.

DOCTOR X718
But so the only thing was the Docusate.

PATIENT X718
Docusate yeah.

DOCTOR X718
I'm just gonna look here.  Where did you get the metoprolol from, was it here?

PATIENT X718
No the last time I was out I had to go to Walgreens.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.

PATIENT X718
That's going back here.

DOCTOR X718
So we can try and get that.

PATIENT X718
Uh I think it was at St. xxx's.  I know I sound vague @@@ you know my wife handles a lot of this stuff you know.

DOCTOR X718
Yeah.  Well the, it's I mean I guess as long as you're taking, if you're getting all your medical care here it helps to have you getting them in one place.  You know because it's impossible for you to know some of the things that happen in other hospitals.

PATIENT X718
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X718
But to keep track of what medications they've given you okay so.

PATIENT X718
Okay.

DOCTOR X718
So the metoprolol we'll do that.

PATIENT X718
So I can go down to the Pharmacy and get that today?

DOCTOR X718
Yeah you can basically, metoprolol.

PATIENT X718
You put the Dulcolax in there?

DOCTOR X718
Yeah I'm gonna do that too um.  Okay the statin.

PATIENT X718
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X718
The atorvastatin.

PATIENT X718
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X718
And you can get it out there, oh it looks like you got it recently, you got that on the 24th uh.

PATIENT X718
I think what probably happened was the doctor prescribed it at 150 mg a day twice a day and I only got the 50 mg so I went right straight through it you know and that's why I'm almost out.  

DOCTOR X718
Okay.

PATIENT X718
And I need enough to make 150 mg a day.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  Do you have enough insulin or do you need the um?

PATIENT X718
Well according to the package it says that it's only filled for 28 days so.

DOCTOR X718
@@@.

PATIENT X718
I need the needles and the insulin.

DOCTOR X718
Okay.  And so these are the only things I'm going to refill for a month's supply.

PATIENT X718
Okay.

DOCTOR X718
What I want you to do is with your old um, yeah with whatever bottles you've been taking before okay.

PATIENT X718
Bring them back?

DOCTOR X718

PATIENT X718

PATIENT X718

PATIENT X718
Um I think I was supposed to take a stress test out there.  I think @@@ know about this but my wife was trying to make the appointment @@@.

DOCTOR X718
So basically if you're seeing a cardiologist there you can continue seeing them.

PATIENT X718
Hmm.

DOCTOR X718
If you need to see a cardiologist here we would want you to establish care here so.

PATIENT X718
Okay.

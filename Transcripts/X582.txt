DOCTOR X582
What have you done to relieve this?

PATIENT X582
After a while it just went away.

DOCTOR X582
It just goes away.

PATIENT X582
I'll put a heating pad on it at night and take Tylenol.  I mean iboprofen but that don't seem to be doing no good this time.

Okay.

PATIENT X582
That's yesterday and the day before, and the day before.

DOCTOR X582
Uh when you have these low, these low glucoses in the 50s, do you feel it?

PATIENT X582
I felt them last night.

DOCTOR X582
You did, what time was that?

PATIENT X582
And the same this morning.  It was like it this morning, I feel so lightheaded.  I went downstairs and uh got me some glucose tablets.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  

PATIENT X582
And so this morning when I checked my sugars it was 102.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.

PATIENT X582
So I know it was lower than that last night because like I said when I woke up I was so lightheaded and all that I had to walk downstairs and get some glucose and I just ate about four tablets of that.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  You felt lightheaded.  So it seems like what are the dates on all of these?

PATIENT X582
Well like I said, the last one is today.

DOCTOR X582
So this is from this morning?

PATIENT X582
And that's yesterday.

DOCTOR X582
This is from yesterday.

PATIENT X582
And the day before.

DOCTOR X582
So this reading right here is it from the morning or the night?

PATIENT X582
In the morning.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.

PATIENT X582
When I woke up that morning.

DOCTOR X582
And then what was dinner?  Bedtime was 125?

PATIENT X582
Yeah.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  The blood pressure's been okay.  How much insulin are you taking now?

PATIENT X582
74.

DOCTOR X582
74?

PATIENT X582
Yeah.

DOCTOR X582
How long have you been taking 74?

PATIENT X582
Since last week.

DOCTOR X582
Hmm, I think that might be a little too much for you.  And how much are you taking at lunch, I mean you're taking 74 plus three times a day, you give yourself shots?

PATIENT X582
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X582
Twice a day, what time?

PATIENT X582
In the morning and at bedtime.

DOCTOR X582
With regular insulin or with Aspart?

PATIENT X582
Who?

DOCTOR X582
Which kind of insulin, Aspart or regular?

PATIENT X582
I guess I do regular.

DOCTOR X582
Regular.  So you get that in the morning and at lunch time are you feeling lightheaded?  You have a lot of low readings around lunch.

PATIENT X582
Well see actually I don't get up till around 11 o'clock.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.

PATIENT X582
So then I'm up to eat at 12 o'clock.

DOCTOR X582
What time are you, so let me understand.  At night what time do you give yourself the shots, the 74?

PATIENT X582
At 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR X582
10 p.m.?

PATIENT X582
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X582
And before you give yourself the 74 you take your sugars right?

PATIENT X582
Yes.

DOCTOR X582
Okay and that's the Lantus and then let me see what else you're taking, hold on.  And then regular.  How much are you doing of regular?

PATIENT X582
5 in the morning and 8 at night.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  I think we're gonna have to take you down a little bit.  So before this week you were doing 70 of Lantus at night?

PATIENT X582
Yeah.

DOCTOR X582
And you were over 200 and now you're in the 50s?  Hmm.  How's the diet been?

PATIENT X582
Same, exactly the same.

DOCTOR X582
Are you taking all your blood pressure pills?

PATIENT X582
Yep.

DOCTOR X582
And what time to do you take the 8 at night of regular?

PATIENT X582
About 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR X582
Oh why are you taking it at 10?

PATIENT X582
Cause that's when I go to bed.

DOCTOR X582
Well you should take the 74 at 10 and then you take the regular before dinner.  What time do you eat dinner?

PATIENT X582
I eat dinner around 8 o'clock, 7 or 8 o'clock.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  So I think that we need to change when you're taking it okay.  And what time do you take the 5?

PATIENT X582
Once in the morning.

DOCTOR X582
What time in the morning?

PATIENT X582
Whenever I wake up, 12 o'clock, 11 or 12 o'clock.

DOCTOR X582
Even though your sugars are so low like that?

PATIENT X582
@@@ insulin I'm supposed to take at 12 o'clock.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  I'm not trying to, I'm trying to make it so you don't have real low sugars cause I don't want, it's dangerous to be hypoglycemic right.  I want to make sure that we're taking care of you.  So you give yourself one shot at night at 10.

PATIENT X582
Yes.

DOCTOR X582
Or you give yourself two shots at 10?

PATIENT X582
One shot.

DOCTOR X582
One shot of the 74?

PATIENT X582
Yeah.

DOCTOR X582
And then you wake up in the morning and then before breakfast do you give yourself the 5?

PATIENT X582
Yes the 5 and the 74.

DOCTOR X582
But the 74 you said you give at night right?

PATIENT X582
I do that twice a day.

DOCTOR X582
Oh you do the 74 twice a day.

PATIENT X582
Yes.

DOCTOR X582
So when you wake up at about 10, let's say 10 a.m., 10 to 11 a.m. you give yourself the 74.

PATIENT X582
Plus 5.

DOCTOR X582
Plus 5 and then again at 10 you give yourself the 74 plus 8.

PATIENT X582
74 plus 8.

DOCTOR X582
Plus 8 okay.  But you don't eat after.

PATIENT X582
No.  I eat before.

DOCTOR X582
I think we're gonna have to change some of that and is that how they told you to take it?

PATIENT X582
Well as long as I take it @@@.

DOCTOR X582
Because your blood sugars, see the 5 and the 8 are supposed to be covering you for your meals.  Do you have breakfast every day when you wake up?

PATIENT X582
No.

DOCTOR X582
Do you eat lunch?

PATIENT X582
Yes.

DOCTOR X582
What time do you eat lunch?

PATIENT X582
When I get up.

DOCTOR X582
Okay so you get up in the morning and you eat something.

PATIENT X582
Yeah.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  And then so you only have two meals a day?

PATIENT X582
Basically.

DOCTOR X582
And then you have your dinner.

PATIENT X582
Yeah.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  Alright.  Let me think about how we're gonna change this so that you don't get these lows cause I don't want you to get these lows you know.  Cause it's dangerous and you're feeling it right.

PATIENT X582
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  Let's see what else is going on with you.  Um any more bleeding from your rectum?

PATIENT X582
Nope.

DOCTOR X582
Coughing up blood?

PATIENT X582

PATIENT X582

DOCTOR X582
Sometimes, I don't want it to, I know sometimes the rosuvastatin, the statins can interact with the HIV medicines so I don't want to um do too high of a dose.  Let me see what you're and you're taking that every night, not missing any.  Okay.  Let me look at um, here.  Your lipids were better the last time, what happened?

DOCTOR X582
Alright so I filled out all this.  I think it should be good for you.  Um oh when was your last tetanus shot do you know?

PATIENT X582
I don't know.

DOCTOR X582
Let me see.  Uh I don't know how to find it.  Hold on; let me ask DOCTOR how I find when it was.  This is for you.  The other thing that I wanted you to do is your nighttime insulin, I want you to take you before you eat instead of at 10 okay.  So take your morning in the morning like you've been doing.  Have your breakfast or lunch or whatever meal you eat.  Then take your nighttime insulin before bedtime okay.  And make sure you check your sugars and if you're still getting those lows in the morning then I want you to drop back down to 70 instead of 74. Does that sound like a plan?

PATIENT X582
Okay.

DOCTOR X582
And I want you to come back and see our pharmacist in 1-2 weeks okay.  And then I want you to see me in three months and I'm going to order some urine tests for you okay.  And I think everything else is good.  

PATIENT X582
Was there something you could give me for this shoulder?

DOCTOR X582
For the shoulder.

PATIENT X582
Yes.

DOCTOR X582
You can take Tylenol.  Do you take Tylenol?  Do you want Tylenol?

PATIENT X582
Okay.

DOCTOR X582
How much are you taking?

PATIENT X582
500 I think.

DOCTOR X582
500 how many times a day?

PATIENT X582
Twice.

DOCTOR X582
Okay.  Well you can take it up to four times a day.

PATIENT X582
Okay.

DOCTOR X582
See if that'll help.  The other thing is on this I'm gonna have to put that you have HIV and hepatitis B cause they are communicable diseases, that means like if you were to get hurt and start bleeding then you know.

PATIENT X582
That's all VA.

DOCTOR X582
Okay I just wanted you to know.  Okay let me figure out how to find out about your tetanus alright, I'll be right back.

PATIENT X278
Alright.

DOCTOR X278

PATIENT X278
Oh, I can't complain.

DOCTOR X278
Good.

PATIENT X278
Well yes I can.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
Uh my legs hurt.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
But uh I can deal with it.

DOCTOR X278
How long has it been hurting for?

PATIENT X278
A month and a half.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
These, I got 30, I got 29 1/2, they was uh.

DOCTOR X278
For sleeping.

PATIENT X278
Yeah.

DOCTOR X278
Not working.

PATIENT X278
Actually it produced mood swings.

DOCTOR X278
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X278
Constipation.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
And it's more the drug than anything else.  I just want to sleep that's all, yeah.

DOCTOR X278
So tell me about your sleeping, why can't you sleep?

PATIENT X278
I don't think they found me yet.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah.

PATIENT X278
It's @@@ but uh, I'm up three or four times a night.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.  And not getting up to urinate or anything like that?

PATIENT X278
Uh yeah maybe once.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
I just can't sleep.

DOCTOR X278
And then the last time I suggested doing a sleeping test and you didn't want to do that.

PATIENT X278
A sleeping oh, you mean come in here and do a.

DOCTOR X278
Yes and do you know if you snore or that kind of thing?

PATIENT X278
No I don't snore.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah and the reason is, you when know they can see if you have sleep apnea if you have something causing to do that.  Is pain waking you up at all?  Pain in your legs?

PATIENT X278
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.  And I think last time we talked about good sleep hygiene is any of that helping you?  Like not watching TV and you know you're having dinner past 6, that should be fine, you're not drinking too water or caffeine before bed?

PATIENT X278
No definitely not.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
In fact I only drink half a cup of coffee in the morning.

DOCTOR X278
Okay and then your bedroom is like quiet, dark.

PATIENT X278
Yeah.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
I just can't sleep, that's all.

DOCTOR X278
Do you have bad dreams?

PATIENT X278
Everybody  had a bad dream every now and then but that doesn't, I just ignore that @@@.

DOCTOR X278
I'm just going to add that you have bad dreams.

PATIENT X278
This probably would have been okay but it's more of a you know it's just like I'm not depressed.

DOCTOR X278
Right, right.

PATIENT X278
So that's not that.

DOCTOR X278
Right, right.  It doesn't sound like you're depressed.

PATIENT X278
Yeah so that uh.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah and I still think a sleeping study would tell us why you can't sleep or at least rule some things out.  Okay you're taking, how much methadone are you taking?

PATIENT X278
About 7.

DOCTOR X278
So you'll be off of it soon.

PATIENT X278
Yeah, next month.

DOCTOR X278
That's great.  And then no TV watching before bed right?

PATIENT X278
No.

DOCTOR X278
Hmm.  

PATIENT X278
Plus if I lay there long enough eventually I go to sleep.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah but you need rest.

PATIENT X278
Yeah.

DOCTOR X278
Okay anything else going on?

PATIENT X278
No.

DOCTOR X278
Okay and then you're still smoking?

PATIENT X278
Yes.

DOCTOR X278
Okay, how many cigarettes a day?

PATIENT X278
Uh four.

DOCTOR X278
Okay, using patches and gum still?

PATIENT X278
Uh I'm done using the patches and gum, I still smoke.

DOCTOR X278
Alright.  So did you ever end up seeing the Smoking Cessation Clinic?

PATIENT X278
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X278
And.

PATIENT X278
I don't think I was there before, to be honest with you.

DOCTOR X278
Okay, so not ready to quit then?

PATIENT X278
Uh I don't think so, I'm settling with it, I'm ready to but uh.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah.  Let's see your blood pressure is high here, we'll recheck it again.  You're on amlodipine 10.

PATIENT X278
Uh yeah amlodipine.

DOCTOR X278
Okay did you take your medications today?

PATIENT X278
No.

DOCTOR X278
Oh, so that may be why it's high.

PATIENT X278
I usually don't take it until like about 9 o'clock.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
You know.

DOCTOR X278
Well did we do labs on your today?

PATIENT X278
Uh yeah labs, I did the labs a week, Saturday I think.

DOCTOR X278
I think that was for the Liver Clinic though.

PATIENT X278
No you told me to do labs before I came.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah, well we didn't get them, oh, okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X278
And I think those are your labs so.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah cause these look like your HCV labs.  Yeah so you were, okay.  The new labs I ordered for January 30th and they want, oh you're supposed to get another CT.

PATIENT X278
Yeah the 29th of May yeah.

DOCTOR X278
Oh the 29th, that's right okay.  Okay.  So you saw them just in January.

PATIENT X278
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X278
So you'll get that CT for that liver testing.

PATIENT X278
Right.

DOCTOR X278
And they'll to you more about that.

PATIENT X278
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.  Well your AFP is normal and are they saying that, are they saying that they are going to treat your hepatitis C though?

PATIENT X278
Yes.

DOCTOR X278
When are they going to do that?

PATIENT X278
Uh well actually this @@@.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
So.  

DOCTOR X278
I was trying to see if there are any medications you're taking that, cause the problems with medications for sleep, a lot of them are bad for your liver.

PATIENT X278
Alright.

DOCTOR X278
And you have hepatitis C; I really don't want to give you anything you know some of the normal drugs we give for a liver, for sleep are very, very bad for liver patients.

PATIENT X278
Oh then I can go without sleeping.

DOCTOR X278
Oh, but that's why but I want to help you um but at the same time you know we can't really.

PATIENT X278
And I can go without the sleep if it will damage the liver; it's just not that, I can deal with it.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah.  So, yeah there's not as many medications that we can do for that um.  Let's see your 61 and you're on something for diabetes.  Your last A1c was good and you're taking the metformin and that's fine.

PATIENT X278
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X278
Okay good.  We're doing just fine.

PATIENT X278
@@@ drop backwards, @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah.  And thrombocytosis, so for the hypertension you're just on the felodipine.

Hypertension?

DOCTOR X278
Yeah high blood pressure.

PATIENT X278
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah.  And you're on let's see.

PATIENT X278
When something runs out, usually as soon as I get one I'll call in uh and have it you know, they'll deliver it when the other one is out you know.  One of them I ran out of, I can't remember which one it was.

DOCTOR X278
Hmm.  Let's take a look.  

PATIENT X278
You might have redone it already.

DOCTOR X278
Yeah.

PATIENT X278
Cause this was, I believe, probably maybe a week ago, two weeks ago.

DOCTOR X278
Maybe the finasteride?  I recently, the nicotine patches were all gone, methadone @@@ of the methadone.

PATIENT X278
Right.

DOCTOR X278
Tamsulosin, metformin?  You have refills.

PATIENT X278
That's probably what it was.

DOCTOR X278
Or aspirin maybe.

PATIENT X278
No I got it, it wasn't aspirin.  Like I say when I get it I order the next one so I have a.

DOCTOR X278
It might be the mirtazapine, you only one, you have 0 refills.

I'll just see what my attending says and see if he's got any other ideas.  Um and then we'll go from there.  Now do me a favor, next time out, check your blood pressure at home and tell me what it is.

PATIENT X278
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X278
The other blood pressure medicine.  The other blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X278
Uh.

DOCTOR X278

PATIENT X278
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X278
Uh, so I'm going to start you on a small dose and have you come back, I'll have you come back in two weeks for a blood pressure check.

PATIENT X278

DOCTOR X278
Um and I'll have you come back in two weeks, so you can get all your labs in two weeks actually.

PATIENT X278
Okay.

DOCTOR X278

PATIENT X278
Okay.

DOCTOR X278

PATIENT X278
What's the BNP now?

DOCTOR X278
Your chemistry, electrolytes.

PATIENT X278

Your creatinine, that way cause sometimes the medication can have a little effect, usually for most people its fine um.  Can you pick up your medication today?

PATIENT X278
Sure.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.  And the one thing that @@@ liver disease is trazodone.

PATIENT X278
Okay.

DOCTOR X278
Um we can try that, a small dose of that.

PATIENT X278
Okay.

DOCTOR X278
And we'll see how you're doing and you know and we'll just take the mirtazapine off.

PATIENT X278
Okay.

DOCTOR X278
We know that it wasn't.  I think that's about it, let me see if there's anything else that I need to do uh and as far as, we'll try the trazodone and as far as sleep hygiene, things like exercising before bed can help.

PATIENT X278
But that's what I do.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
I exercise, yeah.

DOCTOR X278
You do all that.

PATIENT X278

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
I start to try to exercise at 8 o'clock and I usually try to go to sleep about 9:30.

DOCTOR X278
Okay.

PATIENT X278
And I have no trouble going to sleep, trouble staying asleep.

DOCTOR X278
So I want to take off your mirtazapine.  Oh it's expired anyway okay.  Okay, then that's pretty much it.  Okay.  And you start on the trazodone and then we should be good.

PATIENT X278

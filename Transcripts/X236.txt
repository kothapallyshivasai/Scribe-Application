So far so good.  I had the surgery on my rotator cuff.

DOCTOR X236
Oh you did.

PATIENT X236
Yeah.  Matter of fact I feel, I don't know what but I felt much better when I wasn’t taking that Plavix for those ten days.

DOCTOR X236
Really.

PATIENT X236
I felt 100% better and that's for real.  When I wasn’t taking the Plavix and the aspirin I felt much better.

DOCTOR X236

PATIENT X236
I felt normal.

DOCTOR X236
Alright.  Where'd you have your surgery at?

PATIENT X236
Yeah.  I'm getting ready, uh I'm using a robotic chair now for list, for motion and lift up my shoulder and uh I got another week of that and then I'm going to Physical Therapy.  I should be off work until August I guess.  I would've retired this year but I have to wait now and get that six months back so I'm retiring January 31st.  

DOCTOR X236
How's your blood pressure been?

PATIENT X236
My blood pressure's been um, around the same thing it was like today, 142/80.  When I had the surgery, the same day of the surgery, my blood pressure was 180/100 and they took it five minutes later and it was normal.

DOCTOR X236
And how's your foot been?

PATIENT X236
My foot's better.  My sugar has been great, averaging about 110-115.  

DOCTOR X236
And are you smoking?

PATIENT X236
Still smoking yep.

DOCTOR X236
About five cigarettes a day still?

PATIENT X236
Yeah.

DOCTOR X236
Now were you trying patches or anything like that?

PATIENT X236
I had some patches yeah, I still got some, ain't doing no good.

DOCTOR X236
Well you're almost there.

PATIENT X236
Yeah, yeah.  I'm waiting for that day when I can wake up and say I ain't smoking no more, just give it up.  I hope yes, that's what I pray for.

DOCTOR X236
Alright, so you said your sugars has been running what?

PATIENT X236
Uh between 90 and the highest it's been since I been on the medicine in September is 180 but it's averaging, on average its like 115.  I got that 180 cause I ate a lot of stuff I shouldn't ate but overall its like between 90 and 115.

DOCTOR X236
Good.  Uh all you had is at xxx xxx?

PATIENT X236
Uh yep.

DOCTOR X236
Okay uh so a few things I would like to do.

PATIENT X236
Alright.

DOCTOR X236
Now that it's safe to hold the Plavix.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
Um I know that you had doctors that wanted to do another EGD and colonoscopy.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
Uh the scope from the upper and lower.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
Uh cause you know you had lost quite a bit of blood uh.  I don't remember when that was.

PATIENT X236
Yeah.

DOCTOR X236
I'm sure you, I think it was around what like March?

PATIENT X236
Yeah that was when uh my stool had turned black.

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
So um you know they wanted to repeated those tests to make sure everything was kind of resolved.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
But they wanted to wait until it was safe to hold the Plavix.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
And now you know we had to wait at least a year.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
Uh before we could hold the Plavix and I spoke with DOCTOR and she's saying you know you're probably going to need it life-long.  They're recommending lifelong Plavix but if you need to, for procedures like the surgery.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
Uh we're okay to hold it for the and start it @@@ alright.  Other stuff um, I would like to get some blood work on you.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
And uh and actually what are you doing for your blood pressure control?

PATIENT X236
Um lisinopril and.

DOCTOR X236
And.

PATIENT X236
And another I forget.  Simvastatin?  Is that it?

DOCTOR X236
Uh that's for your cholesterol.

PATIENT X236
That's cholesterol, simvastatin is cholesterol uh.

DOCTOR X236
It looks like we've just got you on the metoprolol.

PATIENT X236
The metoprolol yeah that's it.

DOCTOR X236
Uh now we can increase that.

PATIENT X236
Metoprolol?

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.

PATIENT X236
To what?

DOCTOR X236
75 twice a day.

PATIENT X236
75, what am I taking now?

DOCTOR X236
You're at 50.

PATIENT X236
Oh okay.  75 twice a day.

DOCTOR X236
@@@ you've go the 50 mg tablets.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
But you're only taking half a pill a day.

PATIENT X236
Half of that yes.

DOCTOR X236
Uh so we can actually increase you to a full tablet.

PATIENT X236
To the full tablet?

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
So that should make it easier so won't have to split that one.

PATIENT X236
Okay yeah it is doc.  Well I've gotten good at it, I just take it and put them in my hands, even with it band working itself I can break it in half yep.  Same way with those uh cholesterol pills.  They're bigger.

DOCTOR X236
Well let me take a look and listen to you.

PATIENT X236
Alright.

DOCTOR X236
So I can get you going.  

PATIENT X236
Right here?

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.

PATIENT X236
Alright.

DOCTOR X236
This shoulder?

PATIENT X236
Yeah.

DOCTOR X236
Take a few deep breaths.  Okay breathe normal.  Squeeze my fingers close down, good.  And uh which toe had the trouble?  Was it the right one?

PATIENT X236
It was the right one yeah.

DOCTOR X236
It's uh; let's take a look at that.  It looks good.

PATIENT X236
Yeah it was like that after three, three four weeks.  I mean I was blessed because it could've been worse than that couldn't it?

DOCTOR X236
Right.

PATIENT X236
Like my whole leg.

DOCTOR X236
Yeah absolutely.  We do what we can and we try and get the infection taken care of as quick as possible but.

PATIENT X236
Yeah I was going.

DOCTOR X236
But people who get a small portion of a limb cut off often have to go back for you know take bigger hunks off.

PATIENT X236
Really?

DOCTOR X236
Oh yeah.  But I mean we try and do.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
We try and leave people with as much as we can.

PATIENT X236
Yeah but that's what they did.  I got 3/4 of my toe anyway.

DOCTOR X236
Yeah but uh you know some people have to have their foot, you know and all their toes taken off.

PATIENT X236
Yeah.

DOCTOR X236
And uh then you know the reason they have to have their toes taken off is that they've got bad diabetes or vascular disease.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
So that way there were problems in the first place but that also makes it difficult for that wound to heal.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
So then it'll get infected again and the infection will move up and you keep going up the leg which isn't good.

PATIENT X236
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X236
And they want to take a little tiny piece off.

PATIENT X236
Yeah.

DOCTOR X236
Uh but, good, uh alright so uh I actually don't want to do a ton of changes with you since it sounds like you're doing pretty well.  So what I would like to do is repeat some blood work today, are you okay with that?

PATIENT X236
Today?

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.  

PATIENT X236
Yeah, that's okay.

DOCTOR X236
Um so you can get down.

PATIENT X236
What do those cholesterol pills actually do?

DOCTOR X236
Lowers your cholesterol.

PATIENT X236
Yeah.

DOCTOR X236
The cholesterol, high cholesterol puts you at risk for like heart disease.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
Uh peripheral vascular disease.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
Uh, like do you hear about plaques forming in your heart?

PATIENT X236
Yeah.

DOCTOR X236
Or in your blood vessels.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
Uh cholesterol contributes to the plaque.

PATIENT X236
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X236
So the less you have in there the better off you are.

PATIENT X236
Okay.  Okay.  So I'll take the whole pill of metoprolol?

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.

PATIENT X236
Starting tomorrow, I took a half pill today.

DOCTOR X236
Yeah you could even start tonight if you want.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
Take a whole pill tonight.

PATIENT X236
Okay.

DOCTOR X236
Cause you're taking it twice a day right?

PATIENT X236

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.

PATIENT X236
Do I still take it twice a day?

DOCTOR X236
Yeah.

PATIENT X236
A whole pill okay.

DOCTOR X236
When was your last colonoscopy?

PATIENT X236
I never had one.

DOCTOR X236
Never had one?

PATIENT X236
A colonoscopy is when they go into your.

DOCTOR X236
So yeah the same thing only when we go in through your rectum.

PATIENT X236
Oh I never had that.

DOCTOR X236
Okay.

PATIENT X236
But I think they did send a probe up in when I was bleeding internally, they said I had ulcers or something.  Is that the same thing?

DOCTOR X236
It's essentially the same thing.

PATIENT X236
Oh.

DOCTOR X236
It's a slightly different scope but yours wasn't exactly the same.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
But they go in from below.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh, okay.

DOCTOR X236
So what we'll do, I'll put in a consult and have them do both.

PATIENT X236

DOCTOR X236

PATIENT X236
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X236

(Doctor working on computer 35:23 - 37:45)  I think at some point we're going to need you to repeat your cholesterol.  Uh but that'll likely come, we'll need to do it when you're fasting.

PATIENT X236
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X236
So.

PATIENT X236
What do you mean repeat my cholesterol?

DOCTOR X236
The cholesterol test.

PATIENT X236
Oh, oh the test.

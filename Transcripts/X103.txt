DOCTOR X103
Hi there.  I'm DOCTOR come on back.  @@@.  How you feeling?

PATIENT X103
I feel pretty good.

DOCTOR X103
@@@.  Can I have your coat; I can hang it up for you?  Oh @@@.

PATIENT X103
It's a recording yep.

DOCTOR X103
Great, okay, gotcha.  Alright so how are you doing sir?

PATIENT X103
Okay, doing alright, getting by.

DOCTOR X103
@@@ It's very good to see you.  You know the last time I saw you you were talking a lot about tiredness and having fatigue.

PATIENT X103
@@@ it hasn't left yet.

DOCTOR X103
Hasn't left yet huh.

PATIENT X103
@@@ cut that out because uh you know, @@@ a little bit.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.  Been a little bit off balance?

PATIENT X103
Off balance.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.

PATIENT X103
So @@@.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X103
(Laughter) So ain't gonna have you cut it out and @@@ I'm getting better.

DOCTOR X103
@@@.  

PATIENT X103
@@@.  Well I'm not staggering.  That's just about it.  Also um I noticed it takes more heat for me to get warm.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.

PATIENT X103
You know as compared to some of the other members of my family.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.  

PATIENT X103
Yeah, I don't know why.

DOCTOR X103
You use more blankets, that kind of thing?

PATIENT X103
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Have you been having any other symptoms like constipation or any stool changes.

PATIENT X103
No.

DOCTOR X103
Nothing like that, okay.  Um you know typically a couple of the things that we think about, I know you've had the trouble with the fatigue, trouble getting warm um.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Those types of things can be related to endocrine issues, meaning hormone issues um.  But we have checked hormone levels including thyroid hormones.  Typically we think about when you express those symptoms and they were normal okay.  Well I finally checked on it and it looks like even just last month, back in March and uh it looks fine.  Um other things we think about sometimes are anemia causing that, some tiredness, maybe increased coldness um but for anemia I believe it's, let me double check but I think it's been pretty stable if a little bit better over the last month.  They have been checking that when you come in for various appointments and you're pretty stable, not too low.  Okay your number right now is 12.7 so I think that's acceptable considering you know all the therapy you've been going through with the radiation and things like that.

PATIENT X103
What about the uh PSA?

DOCTOR X103
The PSA, another good question.  The PSA looks good.  Let me pull up your numbers for you so you can see them.  There you go um; we go back to all your results here at the VA.  When they became concerned with them was when they got up to 10.9 here back in December of 2008.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Right now, after the treatment, it's down to 0.04 and they did a @@@ treatment for that too, the androgen depravation therapy you're getting @@@ is that correct?  Um I'll double check for you yeah.  The thing they inject under your skin every three months.

PATIENT X103
Oh yeah, yeah, that's right yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Well I think we're making progress.  That's a major progress with that.  Your prostate levels are nothing right now so, that's what I think we're going to keep following to make sure you don't have any recurrence of the prostate cancer.  Okay.

PATIENT X103
Is @@@ that occurs in patients?

DOCTOR X103
Prostate cancer?

PATIENT X103
No I mean the reoccurrence.

DOCTOR X103
Oh reoccurrence um you know what from what I remember about you again, let me check my notes real quick again, um, yeah your prostate cancer it looks like they were able to do a good resection without any residual disease that they found outside the prostate itself.

PATIENT X103
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X103
So I think you know, given your age, uh where you are right now, they probably have a pretty good idea that you're doing to do well with it or they wouldn't have done the surgery.

PATIENT X103
Oh.

DOCTOR X103
Um you know I can't say @@@ but I think you're gonna do okay.  Your levels have been fine for now.  You did finish the radiation um so we'll see how it goes from there and it's definitely something we'll follow okay.  How have things been going for you otherwise?

PATIENT X103
Oh just fine, fine.  Oh I try to lose weight, trying to get rid of this uh.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.  

PATIENT X103
Well this stomach but uh.

DOCTOR X103
Are you just a little too heavy?

PATIENT X103
Yeah I just want to slim down @@@.  See if I feel much better.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.  You said you weren't quite as active now because you have the tiredness.

PATIENT X103
Tiredness.

DOCTOR X103
Kind of off balance.

PATIENT X103
Off balance.

DOCTOR X103
Well I would say hold off until you start feeling a little better.  I don't want you hurting yourself trying to do too much and right now you're at 230 pounds or so.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
This is up for you definitely um.  We have you at 212 even back in October last year so you're up about 10 pounds.

PATIENT X103
My blood pressure is down.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.

PATIENT X103
Down at home.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah it looks good.

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103
A blood pressure monitor?

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.

PATIENT X103
So I take mine and it was 140.

DOCTOR X103

PATIENT X103
At home.

DOCTOR X103

PATIENT X103
You take it three times it goes down.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.

PATIENT X103
I don't know why but.

DOCTOR X103
Now the last time I saw you we made two changes, your @@@ diabetes medicine is kind of what?

PATIENT X103
Oh, that medicine, I haven't taken it cause my blood pressure went down.  What kind of pills?

DOCTOR X103
How far did it go down?

PATIENT X103
Around 120 and stuff like that.

DOCTOR X103
Okay so you're not taking, you haven't taken it yet?

PATIENT X103
No.

DOCTOR X103
Okay we'll stop it then okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay.  Also uh, some of those computer, I didn't get a globe ring.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.  Which ones do you want to get a Walgreens?

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103

PATIENT X103

PATIENT X103

PATIENT X103

PATIENT X103
Yeah it's 400 @@@.

DOCTOR X103
That's fine.  Do you want to just do that and I can take it off of your list over here?

PATIENT X103
Is 400 going to be okay?

DOCTOR X103
Yeah it'd be fine.

PATIENT X103
Fine.  And let's see is that the vitamin D?

DOCTOR X103
Is that the magnesium and.

PATIENT X103
Is that magnesium?

DOCTOR X103
And we've got let's see you said vitamin D but I don't have the prescription for you for vitamin D.

PATIENT X103
The vitamin D comes out as something else.

DOCTOR X103
Oh its thiamine yeah you're right.  The calcium and vitamin D.

PATIENT X103
The calcium.

DOCTOR X103
You want to just get that at Walgreens then?

PATIENT X103
Yeah, yeah okay.

DOCTOR X103
Alright make sure that you keep taking it every day okay.

PATIENT X103

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103
An aspirin.

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103

PATIENT X103
I'm okay, doing just fine.

DOCTOR X103
Okay good.  We'll do calcium um alright @@@.  Anything bothering you today, anything we need to talk about specifically?

PATIENT X103
No.

DOCTOR X103
@@@.  Um let's see alright.  Well I'd like to focus a little bit on your off balance @@@ you know.  

PATIENT X103
That's @@@ going on you know, cause I'm not um putting myself in that position you know to @@@.  Maintain an awareness of this you know.

DOCTOR X103
You're able and have you ever almost fallen?

PATIENT X103
I think I've almost fallen yes sir.

DOCTOR X103
But does it feel like you're going to fall because the room is spinning?

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103
Anything like that.

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
Say it again?

PATIENT X103
Is that normal?

DOCTOR X103
Well it's not normal uh.  But it's not something unexpected though in somebody who you know you're an older gentleman.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Who has gone through a lot recently with the radiation.

PATIENT X103
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X103
You know I don't think that we can, we should downplay it though you know.  It's not abnormal for somebody who's been through what you've been through.  Have you had any problems with your bowel movements at all?

PATIENT X103
Not really.

DOCTOR X103
No trouble with losing your stools like before you get to the toilet or anything like that.

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103

DOCTOR X103

PATIENT X103
This other one, be much better then I sleep better.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.  Alright.  Do you mind if we go through your medicines then real quick and make sure you're taking everything and that we're not missing anything?

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
For your blood pressure you're on hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X103
Yes.

DOCTOR X103
The losartan, losartan does that sound familiar?

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah and then you're not taking the atenolol, correct?  The new one we started.

PATIENT X103
Correct.

DOCTOR X103
You never started that one.

PATIENT X103
No I'm not taking it.  I was wondering what to do there, how do I take one half, it's already small.

DOCTOR X103
Is that the atenolol, don't worry about it you get rid of those okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.  Um yeah I know they're hard to cut in half, it's inconvenient.

PATIENT X103
I @@@.

DOCTOR X103
For your uh cholesterol you're taking the simvastatin.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
You're taking half a pill of that.

PATIENT X103
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X103
A half a pill.

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
You're taking for the diabetes the metformin?

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
That one's twice a day.

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103

PATIENT X103

DOCTOR X103
And then the @@@ we talked about that they put in the implant every three months.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.  Is there anything you're taking besides the vitamin supplements that we're missing?

PATIENT X103
No.

DOCTOR X103
Okay and then the aspirin.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
The aspirin but you're getting that at Walgreens.  Okay.  

PATIENT X103
So I take a vitamin pill.

DOCTOR X103
Keep taking them, they're real good.

PATIENT X103
Okay.  I have to take those.

DOCTOR X103
Good, yeah.

PATIENT X103
You have diabetes.

DOCTOR X103 
Any diabetic changes anywhere?

PATIENT X103
I’m great.

DOCTOR X103
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah it looks like you have real minimal changes @@@.  Well keep doing what you're doing.  Alright and we did your foot exam last time.  You haven't noted any ulcers or changes in your feet or anything like that right?

PATIENT X103
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X103
Alright um alright.  @@@.

PATIENT X103
Yep.

DOCTOR X103
Your kidneys look to be doing real well.

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
Alright.  Before we get to our physical exam uh the one thing that we can talk about is uh, that we haven’t done for you yet is a shingles shot.  Uh I think we've talked about it before but we didn't do it because you were undergoing radiation therapy um.  We talked about doing it uh for a couple of reasons.  Number one is it will reduce your incidence of getting shingles which is a skin condition you can get uh if you're immune system is @@@.  Basically it is a reactivation of a chicken pox virus that you had when you were a kid um cause whenever your immune system is weak, getting older in age it'll come back out and cause you pain um.  So I'd like to get you scheduled for one of those now that we can after the radiation if that's okay with you.

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
Come on up here, I'll take a look at them okay.  There you go.

PATIENT X103
@@@.  I'm sore right here.  @@@.

DOCTOR X103
But you do have a little bruise there.

PATIENT X103
I don't know what it is or what the.

DOCTOR X103
It hurts right here?

PATIENT X103
Just a little bit yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Does it itch at all?

PATIENT X103
A little.

DOCTOR X103
A little.  How long have you noticed that for?

PATIENT X103
Uh it just came on about uh, about a week or so @@@.  I don't think @@@.

DOCTOR X103
Well you know if it persists or gets any bigger give me a call and we'll get you, or I can make another appointment for you.

PATIENT X103
Alright.

DOCTOR X103
Right.  We'll see what it is.  @@@. It looks like a little bit of a bruise there.

PATIENT X103
I think I know @@@.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X103
No on the street.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah that's fine.  You're doing fine.  Let me see your fingers good.  I'll take a listen to you okay.

PATIENT X103
Alright.

DOCTOR X103
A couple deep breaths.  Good.  Again, again and one more.  Very good.  Breathe normally.  Can you feel it in the back when I'm pressing?

PATIENT X103
You know I sitting down, you know where I had a wrist problem.  That's even getting better.

DOCTOR X103
And @@@.

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
Well um.  How do you feel about, what kind of food are you eating during the day?

PATIENT X103
Uh I eat uh breakfast at home and in the morning I eat uh Cheerios you know, the whole grain you know.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.

PATIENT X103
And uh, collard greens, collard greens.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.  Well it sounds like you're eating pretty healthy.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
I'd say keep doing what you're doing.  Try to you know, I don't know if you drink a lot of soda with sugar in it.

PATIENT X103
A little.

DOCTOR X103
Try to limit that.  Try to limit any fatty foods like um you know bacon or sausage or things like that, things that are fattening and kind of give you a little bit of extra weight sometimes.  But otherwise like I said I'm not dissatisfied with where your weight is.  It is up but I think getting through you know going through radiation and all that probably made you a little bit tired.  I expect the radiation; expect the tiredness should resolve in time and time being over a couple months.  You've only just finished the radiation a couple of weeks ago and I'd give you at least another couple months before we start thinking that something else might be going on.

PATIENT X103
Yeah I eat eggs.

DOCTOR X103
Well eggs are high in cholesterol.  Your cholesterol has been fine when we checked it before.  Go ahead and have a seat and let me take a look at that.  You're taking that low dose of the cholesterol medicine right now and it looks like the last cholesterol we checked yeah was uh, your LDL the bad cholesterol was 68, the good cholesterol was 43 so I think you're doing just fine.  Whatever you been eating is probably okay.  Try to cut out some of the things like if you're having a lot of pasta anything like pasta or rice with each meal.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Or daily if you're having like one helping of something like that daily, try to cut some of that out cause those can build up and turn into fat.

PATIENT X103
Potatoes or something like that.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah I mean within reason.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
I wouldn't cut everything out because there's nothing good about that either but definitely things like potatoes, pasta, rice.  You eat too much of them can build up in your body as fats and sugars okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
Alright so um and let's see, you did also get an echocardiogram for you.  I forgot to mention that.  That was completely normal.

PATIENT X103
It was.

DOCTOR X103
Completely normal.

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
Nothing wrong whatsoever.

PATIENT X103
I forgot to ask you about it but uh.

DOCTOR X103
You just got that done yesterday?

PATIENT X103
@@@.  

DOCTOR X103
Yeah no it looks completely normal.  It's pumping up just as much blood as my heart probably is okay.  So no problems with that.  That's not the cause of your tiredness.

PATIENT X103
They didn't tell me, it might sound like a washing machine (laughter).

DOCTOR X103
(Laughter).  Alright.  Well what other questions do you have, do you have any other questions?

PATIENT X103
No, no.

DOCTOR X103
Alright, anything else I can do for you today?

PATIENT X103
No.  No @@@.  I'm okay.

DOCTOR X103
Alright.  Um, I last saw you back in February, I wanted do the vaccine @@@.  I think we're probably going to see you again in a few months or so okay.  I'm going to go ahead and schedule you for four months out from here and I'm going to just double check, I don't think we need to even check anything here.  I'll need to check a blood sugar level but that's it.

PATIENT X103
I keep busy exercising and I think I've doing pretty good at this point.

DOCTOR X103
I would say keep doing what you're doing and don't overdo it because you do have some healing to do from the radiation but uh I think you're doing just fine and I want to emphasize that cause you know there is such a thing as doing too much too soon after cause it's kind of a draining period.

PATIENT X103
Oh.

DOCTOR X103
@@@ so uh but you know I think you're doing fine and I want you to keep doing what you're doing okay.  Alright.  You hang out here for a little bit.  I'm going to go talk to my clinic supervisor.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
Actually one more thing before I leave I just want to double check about uh the one thing that we, I don't know if we talked about it, have you ever had a sleep study before?

PATIENT X103
What's that?

DOCTOR X103
A sleep study where they kind of watch you sleep and see if you snore.

PATIENT X103
Uh no but I heard years ago that I snore a little bit.

DOCTOR X103
You snore a little bit.

PATIENT X103
I also my nostrils tend to clog up.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.

PATIENT X103
I take this uh, @@@ stuff that I get at Walgreens that you put in your nostrils @@@.

DOCTOR X103
@@@.  Is that just Ocean Mist or something like that?

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
You put it in @@@.

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
And that helped you?

PATIENT X103
It seems to but if there's something better I'd like to know what it is.

DOCTOR X103
If that's working I think you can keep doing that um.  You're not having any problems with it unless that stops working then we can change it but I think that's usually the first thing I'd recommend if you have some sinus dryness or some constant irritation in your nasal passage I think that's a good idea.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
I'll put that on your outpatient list.  Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X103
That's supposed to be @@@ better.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah, yeah you know if they have any suggestions go through them and you can give me a call and let me know what they think but I think if the saline nasal spray it working okay then I'd just keep going with that okay, alright.  Uh so the one thing we talked about was the sleep study.  Um sometimes if you snore a lot and you're kind of not getting good sleep because you stop breathing at times at night, it's a problem we call sleep apnea.  You can get tired during the day um.  If you @@@ get evaluated for that, I think it's fine if you want to do that and I would recommend it, just to complete our work-up to see if we can figure out why you're having this tiredness okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X103
Do you mind if I put that order in for you?

PATIENT X103
Right.  

DOCTOR X103
Alright so they can schedule that for you up front @@@.  Alright.  Any other questions or anything?

PATIENT X103
You were asking about @@@.

DOCTOR X103
Okay, let me go talk to my clinic supervisor if you'll wait in here for a little bit I'll be right back in okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X103
I'll just be a few minutes okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR X103
I'll be back in just a second.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  62:35  DOCTOR IN 70:40)

PATIENT X103
Hey how's it going?

DOCTOR X103
So um a couple things that we talked about, I just wanted to touch base with you about um, kind of going through your meds a little bit more.  Your vitamin D level was a little bit low the last time we checked it so I would like to give you a stronger prescription for vitamin D for now until I see you again.

PATIENT X103
Uh I, @@@.

DOCTOR X103
I'll give you a stronger one.

PATIENT X103
Oh a stronger one okay.

DOCTOR X103
And it's going to be a once weekly medication so pick a day like Sunday or something and take it on Sundays for three months until you see me again.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
@@@ okay.  

PATIENT X103
@@@.

DOCTOR X103
Say again.

PATIENT X103
Do I still take the magnesium?

DOCTOR X103
Um you don't have to no.

PATIENT X103
I don't have to take that.

DOCTOR X103
You don't have to that when you're taking this bigger pill okay.

PATIENT X103
What is this something @@@.

DOCTOR X103
The calcium.

PATIENT X103
Calcium.

DOCTOR X103
Uh I mean if you want to take it there's no problem with it I wouldn't say.

PATIENT X103
Oh no.

DOCTOR X103
But you don't have to.

PATIENT X103
I'm not going to take it then.

DOCTOR X103
Exactly.

PATIENT X103
What about the calcium?  

DOCTOR X103
We'll recheck that as soon as you’re done okay.  As soon as you're done with this bigger dose then.   Okay there will be a once a week pill okay.

PATIENT X103
I'm not quite clear on that, on the one that I'm taking now.

DOCTOR X103
So the one that you're taking now, the calcium and the vitamin D, the one that I'm going to prescribe to you is just vitamin D.  It's okay to do whatever you want with your pill with the calcium and vitamin D.  It's not going to give you too much vitamin D and you're not going to miss a whole lot of the calcium if you're not taking it okay.

PATIENT X103
If I'm not taking it.

DOCTOR X103
If you're not taking it it's not gonna be a big deal.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
Okay.  So whichever you prefer if you want to keep taking it that's fine if you don't that's okay.

PATIENT X103
So I'm getting one at Walgreens, that's @@@ call that.

DOCTOR X103
What's that, see if I remember.

PATIENT X103
Cause I mean this vitamin has vitamin D in that also.

DOCTOR X103
Uh-huh.  And I'll check that for you in a few months as well okay.  So when you come in before the next appointment get that vitamin D level for me okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay and then you say this one I can discontinue it.

DOCTOR X103
You can stop it and the pill I'm giving you will be something you'll take for a couple months and then we'll stop it.

PATIENT X103
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X103
Okay we'll recheck your vitamin D level, if it's doing okay then we'll stop this one, the big pill that you take once a week and we'll restart @@@.

PATIENT X103
Now the one I'm taking now I should stop that right now you said.

DOCTOR X103
Yeah.

PATIENT X103
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X103
Um I'm also going to put in a couple other blood draws for you to take a look a little bit closer to this low blood count that we talked about.  I said it's probably from the radiation um.  Sometimes it will cause an anemia but I'd like to work it up and make sure that we don't have a problem with iron, B12 or folate.  Nutritional deficiencies can cause anemia and low blood counts okay.  Do you have any other questions for me?

PATIENT X103
No I think that's about all.  What do I do with this recorder?

DOCTOR X103
I'm not sure, go ahead and take it outside okay.

PATIENT X103
Alright.

DOCTOR X103
When you check out okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
Alright.  Alright so a couple more blood tests and then that one refill.  Everything else is going to stay the same.  You could start taking the magnesium from Walgreens.  Keep getting the aspirin from Walgreens okay and then the one pill that we'll provide for you through the VA okay.

PATIENT X103
Okay.

DOCTOR X103
Sound good?

PATIENT X103
Yeah.

DOCTOR X103
Sign these orders and we'll get you home okay.  Alright.  @@@.  Very nice to meet you @@@.

PATIENT X103
It was very nice to meet you and to see you again.

DOCTOR X103
Okay there you go this one's for you.  Then out and around to the left.  Take care.

PATIENT X103
Okay now.

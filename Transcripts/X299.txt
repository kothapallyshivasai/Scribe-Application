DOCTOR X299
PATIENT?

PATIENT X299
Yes.
 
DOCTOR X299
@@@.

PATIENT X299
Huh?

DOCTOR X299
@@@ have a seat.  @@@ are you doing okay?

PATIENT X299
@@@.  Warm and up, calming down you know.

DOCTOR X299
So.

PATIENT X299
How you doing?

DOCTOR X299
I must admit I was looking through things a little bit here.  I know you saw DOCTOR a couple of weeks ago or like a month ago now.

PATIENT X299
Yes.

DOCTOR X299
So I guess I'm not quite sure what you need today, so you fill me in on what's going on with you.

PATIENT X299
Well uh when I talked you I asked you about the back and all that.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And I had the pain down here.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
That's all taken care of.

DOCTOR X299
Oh good.

PATIENT X299
But um I still have kind of like a numbness on the outside of my leg.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And my toes and the bottom of my toes.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And if uh, if I try to point my toes.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
They cramp up really quick.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  Okay.  You point your toes they cramp up okay.

PATIENT X299
Right.  Besides that, now my back's fine.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
But then also too, I'd say that uh it started just a little bit before I seen the other doctor.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
But now right here, it feels like it's asleep.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
It's not numb.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
I could feel it.

DOCTOR X299
But kind of tingling or?

PATIENT X299
Yeah.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
So if you give me your hand.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
That you know.

DOCTOR X299
@@@.

PATIENT X299
But here.

DOCTOR X299
At the side of @@@ there okay.

PATIENT X299
Yeah and I've been noticing lately that when I pick something up and walk.
DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
Then I mainly are using these three fingers.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
To hold it.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
It just don't function.

DOCTOR X299
Okay, let's see.

PATIENT X299
And I don't know if that was just because um you know the injury to my back because the nerves are all connected.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.  Did you get to Prosthetics?  For that elbow sleeve?

PATIENT X299
Yeah.

DOCTOR X299
Did that help at all?

PATIENT X299
I used that for a week and a half but it was so small.

DOCTOR X299
It wasn't the right size?

PATIENT X299
Yeah well he said it was supposed to be a big sleeve but all it was a elbow pad.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
Like um you wear with football.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  Between the @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT X299
And it was really uncomfortable before I, you know I stopped using it.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
He said it might help out with this, but it really didn't.

DOCTOR X299
And then it didn't okay.  Okay and is it just in the left hand?

PATIENT X299
Yes.

DOCTOR X299
And there's tingling in your feet, is that in both sides or is it?

PATIENT X299
Just on my right.

DOCTOR X299
Just the right.

PATIENT X299
It doesn't cause me any pain.  It doesn't cause me discomfort.

DOCTOR X299
But does the right foot.

PATIENT X299
It's there.

DOCTOR X299
Is this um, in this hand is it getting better or worse?

PATIENT X299
Oh um it was a little bit when it first started and I would just say it's not getting worse.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
But it's not progressing.

DOCTOR X299
So it's not improving, it's kind of steady?

PATIENT X299
Right, right.

DOCTOR X299
Okay um.  Your noticing that you're picking things up with your first three fingers and that you're not using the others as much.

PATIENT X299
I'm still grabbing ahold @@@.

DOCTOR X299
But @@@.

PATIENT X299
Yeah I could feel that you know I've got no strength in the two fingers and it's just my right hand and even when I'm gripping something.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  Okay.  Um and I, so let me see, see questions.  Have you ever had any trauma or injury to your upper spine, your neck or anything like that?

PATIENT X299
No.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  No falls or anything like that?

PATIENT X299
Um I've had falls but nothing serious.

DOCTOR X299
Anything recent since this has all developed?

PATIENT X299
No.  No.

DOCTOR X299
And you this has all developed in the hand within the last month or so?

PATIENT X299
Yeah I would say you know since the last time I've seen you because it's been bothering me then.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
But then when I seen the other doctor um.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.  DOCTOR mentioned that you were.

PATIENT X299
It was just starting.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
That's why he gave me that.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
Sleeve or whatever that was.

DOCTOR X299
Okay, alright um let's see and then just because I know the problem the last time, any blood in your stool?

PATIENT X299
Not at all.

DOCTOR X299
Black stool or anything like that?

PATIENT X299
No.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  Okay any other symptoms besides these things that are bothering you or these few things like the hand and the foot that are the main things that brought you in here?

PATIENT X299
No.  I was going to wait until you talked all about this.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  What else is there?  I just want to make sure of this.

PATIENT X299
Well, this has been a good year and a half.  I got these red splotches and they're very itchy.

DOCTOR X299
Red splotch, very itchy okay.

PATIENT X299
I got that around here um in this area.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
On both arms.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
It's very itchy.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And if I scratch myself I'll notice little white spots.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
On my arms and I have it, it seems like it's just where I scratch.

DOCTOR X299
Is it in your groin @@@?

PATIENT X299
It's here.

DOCTOR X299
And everything okay.

PATIENT X299
But really mainly it's all around my neck.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  Alright and how long has it been?

PATIENT X299
I'd say a good year and a half.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
No I, um I believe the last time when I was having that back problem with the epidural um I mentioned this to the doctor and I think they sent me down to the Dermatology.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And they couldn't figure it out what it was.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And they gave me a cream.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
And that and I used that cream up but it didn't.

DOCTOR X299
Did it help?

PATIENT X299
I really can't remember but it never took care of it because it's still here and then my wife, I guess you know sleeping together with that, she started getting a little bit on her chest.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
But it went away on her.

DOCTOR X299
Okay, okay.  I'm looking at the Dermatology Notes.  

PATIENT X299
You got that?

DOCTOR X299
Yep.  Uh.

PATIENT X299
I believe I only seen them one time too.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah it looks that way.

PATIENT X299
I never heard anything after that.

DOCTOR X299
Looks like they were trying to call.  Um they wanted to see how, they gave you a cream and then they wanted to check what they call an RPR um, it's a test that they sometimes check and I can't see that you ever actually got it.

PATIENT X299
Got it.

DOCTOR X299
That's what I was looking at.  It looks like you were having a lot of driving issues at the time and uh they wanted to have that drawn but weren't able to.  Do you think you could stop at the Lab today and have it drawn?

PATIENT X299
Um.

DOCTOR X299
Or maybe.

PATIENT X299
What do you mean drawn?

DOCTOR X299
Well the blood test that they wanted um at the time but I'll um.

PATIENT X299
Well when I came here today they took four vials.

DOCTOR X299
Okay maybe they can add it on, I don't know sometimes they have special vials.

PATIENT X299
I still got time to give them some more, that's not a problem.  I can go right back to the Laboratory.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah go right back to the Lab.  Let me just see maybe they got it on there.

PATIENT X299
It's not a problem.

DOCTOR X299
I don't know if they would have taken it.

PATIENT X299
Well how would they, if they took blood you know this is on the outside.

DOCTOR X299
On the skin so the thing that the dermatologist was looking for and they're the skin specialists, I don't exactly know the correlation but I just know it's the lab they wanted is something that we check for syphilis to make sure that you've never had any exposure to syphilis in the past.

PATIENT X299
No.

DOCTOR X299
And.

PATIENT X299
Maybe when I was in the service.

DOCTOR X299
You know and that's the thing it can be.

PATIENT X299
That was 30 years ago.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.  The thing with syphilis is it can be one of those things that like doesn't show up for a long time.  I'm not saying that's what you have cause they thought it was something else that was much more common which they called tinea versicolor but they wanted to rule that out and make sure that it wasn't.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
And I don't see that you ever had that lab done.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
So why don't we just get it?

PATIENT X299
It's okay.

DOCTOR X299
And then just to make sure and like I said I don't know the connection and I'm not familiar enough with the skin manifestations of it.

PATIENT X299
Right.

DOCTOR X299
But I just know it's something that they were pretty actively wanting to get from you so let's just, if it's not too much trouble we'll just have you stop in today and it looks like they didn't draw that kind of test from you before so I can't add it on to what they already did.

PATIENT X299
I can, if I remember right, while I was in the service um I was uh diagnosed with I guess you'd call it clap.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
You know it's a yellow leakage.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
From the penis and that.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
And I got the shot and then that was clear.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
But besides any other diseases I don't know.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  I think it's reasonable to check but the others, what they recommended was Selsun lotion and let's try that again.

PATIENT X299
Yeah.

DOCTOR X299
Let's try that again for the rash.  I think that'll.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Um cause I'll look at it again when I examine you here but uh.

PATIENT X299
So what I was doing uh just normally is I found out if I just take like hand lotion you know.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
The lotion that she uses a lot.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
Um and put it on, it sooths it for a while you know.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
But it's like taking the dry skin.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
And it soothes it for a while but then you know.

DOCTOR X299
It comes back.

PATIENT X299
Hour and a half, two hours later.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
It's back itching.

DOCTOR X299
Back to itching huh.  Okay.  Well let's see um okay and it looks like.  I just want to review what imaging you've had, you had a CT.  I'm trying to see if you had any imaging of your upper spine and I don't see any of that.  Most of the imaging you've had has been kind of in the lower body.

PATIENT X299
Right.  L1, 2 and 3.

DOCTOR X299
L1, 2 and 3 yeah.

PATIENT X299
Which was a problem before.

DOCTOR X299
So your, I mean do you still think here in these fingers is a pretty classic distribution of a nerve that comes down.  I don't know if you remember but one time, a while ago, a few years ago, Brett Favre the quarterback.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Took a helmet to the inside of his elbow and it like cracked his elbow here but the nerves run right through that groove right where he got attacked.

PATIENT X299
Well that's like even with the funny bone.

DOCTOR X299
Right.  It's kind of like it goes into the fingers where he lost the strength for a while until that all healed up.  So when it comes up here by your elbow but it comes out down out of your neck so if it had been you know degenerative changes of disks bulging in your spine or any problems in the arms it can pinch that nerve and cause those problems.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
So and I don't see any other imaging so we might want to get some imaging just to see what.

PATIENT X299
Well I can uh, I don't know if it has anything to do with it.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
Like because you know my old age but.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
But I notice that like when it's really quiet.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And I can, I turn.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
My neck like this, I can hear it crackling.

DOCTOR X299
Cracking and stuff.

PATIENT X299
And it just might be just old age right?

DOCTOR X299
Yeah, yeah I mean some of that we just you know we creak and we pop and we kind of, you know, we kind of do that.

PATIENT X299
I never thought anything you know of it.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
It's just something that happens to the body.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
Get old.

DOCTOR X299
Um are you having fevers or chills?

PATIENT X299
No.

DOCTOR X299
Are you feeling sick at all?

PATIENT X299
Um.

DOCTOR X299
No.

PATIENT X299
No.

DOCTOR X299
Do you take steroids, not like injected but like prednisone or anything like that?

PATIENT X299
Um the only pills I take, this one here.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
Um I've only taken two pills.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
It's you know, I thought it had to do with my stomach.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And that's what that was for.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  So you don't take that one very often?

PATIENT X299
Yeah I only took it once and took two pills.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
So I woke up in the middle of the night and my stomach felt it was on fire.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
You know but the only other pills is these here so.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
She wrote it down.  An 81 mg baby aspirin and a multivitamin.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And then fish oil.

DOCTOR X299
And those are the only things that you want to be taking right?

PATIENT X299
Yeah.

DOCTOR X299
@@@.

PATIENT X299
Yeah I have it every night with dinner.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  And you get these outside of the VA?

PATIENT X299
Yes

DOCTOR X299
Outside of the VA okay and that's fine.

PATIENT X299
She takes the same thing but she takes a little bit more @@@.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
I think it's calcium she really goes but then I drink maybe a gallon and a half of milk a week.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
So I get enough calcium in my body but women need.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
Calcium more than guys do.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah so let's see here.  I'm just gonna put these in so I have your list up-to-date on here.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
On the computer.  Okay now fish oil.  Yep.  Okay.  Alright so let's look at your labs and things like that.  Have you had um like a cold or a cough recently or anything like that?

PATIENT X299
Um in the morning but that's because I was smoking.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
I would have phlegm a lot.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And then within a half hour I'd have to blow my nose ten times or so and then it's gone.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
But I'm on the patch.

DOCTOR X299
How's that going for you?

PATIENT X299
And um since my birthday in January 27th and uh I won't say no cigarettes.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
But I might have a couple puffs here and the next day a couple more puffs but it's not the whole, like I was smoking a pack, maybe a little bit more a day and that's you know.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
I'm not doing it.

DOCTOR X299
So now you are down to just like a cigarette or two?

PATIENT X299
Not even two, not even.

DOCTOR X299
Like a couple puffs every other day or every day?

PATIENT X299
I would say okay maybe one a day.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
While I'm still doing the patch.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And I leave it on at night and it doesn't give me nightmares and I'm down to uh, I got two boxes of the first stuff.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
And I'm halfway through with the second box.

DOCTOR X299
Good.

PATIENT X299
Then I go to the next step.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
So that's helping me.

DOCTOR X299
Good, excellent, good job.  That's a big step.  That is a big deal for your health and everything, that's big.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
So you got some labs today.  Let's go through these real quick and then um and then I'll examine you and then we'll get you a plan here for what we want to do okay.

PATIENT X299
Sure.

DOCTOR X299
Alright and I can send you a letter that includes the lab.  So this first lab called the glycosylated hemoglobin, you might know it as hemoglobin A1c and that tells us what your sugars have been like for the last three months so it's something we look at for diabetes and yours is normal so that's good.  So no evidence of diabetes or anything like that.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
So that's good.  Um these labs, they test kind of your, how thin your blood is and it's a function of how your liver is working okay and it's totally normal so that's good.  So those are good.  This is your blood count.  Tells us about your infection fighting cells and your blood, if you're anemic or not and the reason I'm asking you those questions is cause your white blood cell count is elevated and we normally see that in people who have an infection.  Now this is just a number and you're a person sitting here in front of me telling me you don't have any problems going on.

PATIENT X299
Right.

DOCTOR X299
So I believe you more than this number but I just want to kind of make sure that you know we're, you know make sure I'm covering the bases.

PATIENT X299
Yeah um.

DOCTOR X299
No issues, no burning with urination.

PATIENT X299
No.

DOCTOR X299
Or anything like that okay.  I'm not too concerned about it.

PATIENT X299
Could stress be affecting it?

DOCTOR X299
Stress can do that.

PATIENT X299
Okay cause we.

DOCTOR X299
You've had a lot of stress lately?

PATIENT X299
Well she's taking some of her medicine and I don't know medicine.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And the doctors you know, well take less of this and take more of this.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And I just kind of think you know maybe one of the medicines and this medicine.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
They shouldn't be taken together.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
You know, I really don't.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
I doctor that much.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X299
You know just over the phone will do that.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh okay.

PATIENT X299
And um.

DOCTOR X299
So you had some stress?

PATIENT X299
Well yeah, it seems like she'll fly off the handle.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
Um and then it gets to me you know um.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh, okay.  Stress can do that for sure okay.

PATIENT X299
That's about the only thing I mean.  I haven't been sick or cold or anything.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah, well we don't treat numbers, we treat people so you know, but, we'll just do this, all of these are normal, so this is what I wanted to schedule.  Basically this one tells us all your kidney function and that looks normal and all the electrolytes are normal.

PATIENT X299
My white cells.

DOCTOR X299
And your white cells are high yeah.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
I mean they're not abnormal, like you know sometimes if you were to put in Google, you know Google like high white blood cell count, some types of um like cancers and lymphomas have high white cell counts but those are typically 50,000, 60,000 and you're only like 16,000.  So you're in more like with a typical infection or stress type of figure okay.

PATIENT X299
Just write it down so I can tell her about it.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.  And I can send you a note or whatever.  If when I go talk to my supervisor you want to grab her and bring her here I can tell her too so that everybody's on the same page if you want do that too.  Um but the rest of these are all normal.  Your cholesterol is great.  Your cholesterol, your bad cholesterol is 78 so that's perfect.  Your good cholesterol is good, 67 and we want that above 40 so that's good okay.  So all of your cholesterol numbers are good and then down here it tells us about your liver function tests and all those are normal.  So all of your liver function tests are normal.

PATIENT X299
Hmm.

DOCTOR X299
And then they did some iron studies to look at your iron and make sure your iron is okay and that's all normal too okay.  So all that is normal okay.  Let me just look.

PATIENT X299
Is that you only thing you just had is my white cells.

DOCTOR X299
So the only thing about this whole range of everything that's abnormal is that your white blood cells are a little more and you know what it could be is this rash causing you itching all over.

PATIENT X299
Right.

DOCTOR X299
It could be just inflammation from that rash and that may be what it is.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Cause I see you sitting here scratching that might be something, you know that might be what it is.  So that's the only abnormality in all of your labs, everything else is stone cold normal okay.

PATIENT X299
Good, good.

DOCTOR X299
So that's all good so I can send you a letter with that.  So let's see, how about, let me, can you take off your jacket and your shirt so that I can look at this rash?  Let's see @@@ okay and the hemoglobin is good as well cause that's your, remember when the last time you were having some bleeding.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
So we send you had another couple episodes, I still think we might need to do a colonoscopy for you.

PATIENT X299
You want to do the.

DOCTOR X299
Right.

PATIENT X299
You know if we scheduled one, to do it in the morning.

DOCTOR X299
Okay so that we can just drive you.  So what, I can't schedule it but I can order the consult and they'll call you to schedule and then you can just schedule it okay.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
So have a seat there for me and um also the good thing is that DOCTOR when you saw him, he put in a consult for the um Rehab physicians to evaluate you as well and see if there is anything they can help you with for your back and these types of injuries cause they're really good at working with people and figuring out what sorts of deficits they're having like with tingling and things like that.

PATIENT X299
Well I have been doing the exercises.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
The exercises I remember from before.

DOCTOR X299
Good.

PATIENT X299
Uh from before when I had my back.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
So I been doing that.

DOCTOR X299
How long have you had that?

PATIENT X299
Oh all my life.

DOCTOR X299
Is it unchanged?

PATIENT X299
Yes.

DOCTOR X299
Is it painful?

PATIENT X299
I might pull my hair out every now and then but I just think you like it hurts a lot more.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah. And it is and if you know it doesn't look too concerning the only thing is it's kind of big you know.  The typical size which is no bigger than a eraser on the head of a pencil you know.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
On a typical pencil and this is quite of bigger than that and I know it's unchanged but it's been the same way.

PATIENT X299
That's really funny it's just not long ago DOCTOR was talking about it sort of like that.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah, yeah.  The ABCD, did he talk about that?

PATIENT X299
Something like that.  I just remember you saying the size of a pencil.

DOCTOR X299
The size of a pencil yeah.  So we may, this is what I think we're gonna do, I think I'm going to prescribe you the Selsun like they tried before okay and have you stop back and get that lab drawn on your way out.

PATIENT X299
Okay today.

DOCTOR X299
Today.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
If you can if that's okay.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
And then I'm gonna put in a consult for the dermatologist again to see you because by the time you get in with them you'll know if that Selsun is working or not.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
And they'll be able to just look at this and make sure that they think its okay, okay.

PATIENT X299
Now um this does get red.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
But sometimes it does itch.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
And I get sores but I get these little dots.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
Especially when I'm working and I sweat.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
It'll get really prominent.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.  Do you where your patch here?

PATIENT X299
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X299
Okay so I think it's kind of a combination.  Looks like you have a little bit of dry skin in general.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Your skin's a little bit dry but it doesn't, I mean you obviously have a rash all around here.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
And on your neck and everything and I, it looked to me like what they thought it was the last time, the tinea versicolor is what they call it and it's a little fungal infection that just kind of.  It's kind of like athlete's foot.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Like an athlete's foot.

PATIENT X299
Yeah I'm doing cream right now for it.

DOCTOR X299
Right.  So it's kind of like athlete's foot only it's on your body okay and it gets itchy and irritated and everything and it can kind of spread and things like that.  So.

PATIENT X299
Can I have uh, like when I shower.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
I start from the top all the way down.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.  Yeah.

PATIENT X299
Well should I maybe wash my feet, could I like spread that because you're saying it's kind of the same?

DOCTOR X299
Hmm it's kind of similar and I doubt you spread it from your feet and maybe like, it would be pretty rare to spread something from the feet.

PATIENT X299
But it seems just in the shower though.

DOCTOR X299
It's kind of a simple.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
It's just a similar type of thing you know that happens.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
So let's try, so we'll prescribe you the Selsun.  Do you want me to have that mailed to you or do you want to pick it up downstairs?

PATIENT X299
Um I could pick it up, if it's not a big deal.

DOCTOR X299
It's not a big deal, it's not a big deal for me, it's easy to do so.  So I just want to measure this.

PATIENT X299
But that's always, as long as I can remember it's always like that.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  It's probably over caution; I know you said you've always had it.  I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs as well so.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
And now that you're thinking about it you're itching all over huh.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.  That's one thing that I read a lot.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And if I'm sitting down then I'm more itchy and when I'm working.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.  Yeah.

PATIENT X299
I don't notice it.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah hmm.  Deep breath.  Okay.  Now if you want to stand up like you're gonna box me here okay.  Don't let me pull you down.

PATIENT X299
Yeah.

DOCTOR X299
Good, same on this side.  Good don't let me push your hands good, now this one, good.  Okay like you did before squeeze my fingers as hard as you can, okay.  On this side that's good okay, good.  Now let's see if we can do this right where you kind of grab more here.  Okay so it was a little bit weaker in this hand here.  Okay and then spread out your fingers like this and then go on and push your fingers in okay so okay now make a sign like this and don't let me get up.  Okay good.  Push off on the table a little bit so you're putting all your weight push this leg up and then just, okay.  Push off okay push off @@@ okay good.  Now relax, now does this feel the same on both sides?

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
Does this feel the same on both sides?

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
Okay does this feel the same on both sides?

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah okay.  This feels the same over here?

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
Good.  Just want to check your range of motion so put your hands over here like this, now put them behind your back like this okay.  Any trouble with that?

PATIENT X299
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X299
Okay straight down in front of you okay, okay good.  Okay alright, okay so I'm going to go talk to my supervisor.  I'm going to ask, what I want to know if he thinks we need to do some imaging up here okay.  Can you shrug your shoulders up like this for me; don't let me push them down okay.  Any pain in the area.  Okay I'm going to put my hand on your face.  I want you to try and turn your head and I'm going to try and stop you okay.  Turn your head okay now this way good.  And then you've got numbness and tingling on your right foot.

PATIENT X299
You know it's almost just like this.

DOCTOR X299
Almost just like that okay.  Um.  Can you kick your shoes off?  Alrighty okay good.  Can you pull your socks off for me?  Can you feel any pain with this?

PATIENT X299
Yes.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah okay.  Point your toes up towards the sky and don't let me push them down.  Now step on the gas, don't let me pull them up.  Does that hurt?

PATIENT X299
No it's just the pain.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  What's this scar from?

PATIENT X299
Oh a razor knife, work.

DOCTOR X299
Oh gotcha.

PATIENT X299
I think it was uh like six stitches.

DOCTOR X299
Okay alright.  You can get yourself dressed together here um.

PATIENT X299
Um just like this thing with.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
With athlete's feet, the ointment that you have.

DOCTOR X299
Yes.

PATIENT X299
Now I don't have to like uh have it be refilled I had two refills.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
I put the order in for the second one.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
But after this is all over this stuff um, I can get over-the-counter.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah, yeah definitely.

PATIENT X299
Right?  I don't have to come back here to get the refill.

DOCTOR X299
No, no.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Nope you can get it over-the-counter.  Um okay well I'm going to go quick talk to my supervisor here and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
If you would like to go grab your wife I can update you both at the same time if you want to okay.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT: 83:50  DOCTOR IN:  96:27)

DOCTOR X299
Hey hello.

SECOND PERSON X299
Hi.

DOCTOR X299
Alright we got all the troops in one place.  Okay so a few things that we're gonna do.  So just to check out what's going on with your hands here.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@ he wouldn't have told you @@@.

PATIENT X299
Yeah I told her, let her finish.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
@@@.

PATIENT X299
Yeah, yeah, sorry.  I forgot to mention that to you.

DOCTOR X299
Oh yeah, okay.  Probably shouldn't affect it.  You know you should probably @@@ them because you're going all day just to whap them with a Bible and try to break them, now just let them be and if they don't bother you.  But if not, that's probably not @@@.  So we're gonna do a couple of things for this issue, for the hand issue okay.  The first thing is already kind of in process is that the Rehab physicians have already been contacted by DOCTOR, who you saw last month.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
And so their gonna schedule an appointment there a little bit behind there, they'll schedule an appointment but while that @@@ I'm going to order a nerve conduction study which is just to look at, you know that nerve I was talking about that goes around the elbow, that's called the ulnar nerve and just to see if there is anything going on with that nerve and if there is that would prompt to get an MRI which is an advanced study that looks at the nerves and things like that in the neck just to make sure there's no compression or anything that needs to be fixed okay.

PATIENT X299
Well they did say they might want to take a look at the side so.

SECOND PERSON X299
Your dad was @@@.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah so I think this is kind of what we'll do and some of these are going to happen.  The consult is already in.  I'm going to get some x-rays just to give us a baseline of information.  The x-rays won't show any disk bulging and the x-rays don't show the nerves.  If you have some arthritis or something in the neck the x-rays are kind of a good place to start and then I'm going to put in the order for the nerve conduction study and those sometimes take a couple of weeks for them to get scheduled okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
Okay so those are the things that are gonna going to be kind of in the process of working on for that nerve problem.  Okay to make sure we're not missing anything.  Okay so that's the first issue.  The second issue is this rash okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
So it looks like to me the same thing they thought it was back in 2006 which is what called a tinea versicolor okay.  Which is just kind of a fungal skin infection, sort of like the rashes okay.  So what I'm going to do for that is I'm going to give you the Selsun which is the same lotion that they tried before and I'm going to give you the Selsun and in the meantime today I'm going to put in a consult for the dermatologist okay.  And so I want you to try the Selsun and also use some lotion cause your skin is just dry.

SECOND PERSON X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
Okay I don't know if it's hard water or dry air or just @@@ or what but your skin is dry which is adding to that itchiness okay.  So.

SECOND PERSON X299
I had it but it went away and I don't have it anymore.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
So it was the same.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah, some people just.  I think your skin is dry so the irritation is kind of coming from those things okay.  So those, you're going to do the Selsun, I'm going to have the dermatologist see you cause I want them to look at that mole.  There's nothing you know terribly different or scary about it but it is bigger than what we want or like it to be.  You know there's something about those and their, but they may look at it and say it might be better if we take it off you know just to be on the safe side so.  

PATIENT X299
It's been with me all my life.

DOCTOR X299
I know.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
I know.  I had one on my shoulder I was going through the same thing.  You know they were just oh that could be @@@ it's kind of dark it's you know.

PATIENT X299
Like cancer-causing thing @@@ or?

DOCTOR X299
I mean it has, any mole like that's, any mole has the potential to turn into something like a melanoma.  The larger moles, irregular moles, kind of the Dr. Oz thing that he was talking about.  Those have more potential to turn into those types of things.  If it's big, bigger than the top of a pencil eraser.

PATIENT X299
Right.

DOCTOR X299
It has a higher chance of developing into a melanoma down the road.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
So I'm not saying that it is one now but I'm saying that it's of the size that they may be concerned enough to say we should just take it off.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  I don't know that for certain but since you have this other thing going on anyways let's start some treatment, let's go to Derm, see what they say about both issues okay.

PATIENT X299
Well they'll want to do it at the same time?

DOCTOR X299
They should do it at the same time.  If they decide they may just take it off then they make you come back for that appointment and they might not take it off the same day but I can't tell you that okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.  Oh it's okay, yes, @@@.

DOCTOR X299
Oh yeah so you've got a lot of sun exposure.

PATIENT X299
And @@@.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X299
On the beach.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  So the final and we're also gonna get that lab test that they wanted you to get the last time you went to Derm and you never ended up getting.

PATIENT X299
Right.

DOCTOR X299
So you're gonna stop down in the Lab.

PATIENT X299
Yes before we get that.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  The final thing is, did he tell you about his elevated white count?

SECOND PERSON X299
Yes, he told me that.

DOCTOR X299
He did okay.  So this is a little, it's kind of atypical.

SECOND PERSON X299
So how high was that?

DOCTOR X299
So it's 16,000 okay so upper limit of normal is usually around 12, 11 or 12,000 so it's not extremely high you know.  It can go much higher so and the differential that we call the differential, the different types of cells within the white blood cell count is all normal.  Or he has higher neutrophils which is kind of usually the one that fights infections which is why I kept asking you all these questions.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
So in my head if I stretch far enough we can kind of associate that maybe with increased stress and maybe this rash is causing inflammation but we would sort of want to be overly cautious and check a couple of things just to make sure okay.  So you don't have an infection that's hiding somewhere that we don't know.  So since you said you'd stop back at the Lab anyway, can pee for us, give us a urine sample you think?

PATIENT X299
I think so.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  So we'll just do a urine test to make sure you don't have a urinary tract infection that's not giving us any you know evidence of you know maybe you don't have any symptoms but I don't know if you've ever had a kidney stone or anything, you have.  So kidney stones can cause kind of chronic infections and sometimes they don't give symptoms so you know let's check a urine sample and then the other thing we typically do when we're looking for a kind of pain infection is a chest x-ray.  Do you have time to stop at the Lab and the X-ray today or not?

SECOND PERSON X299
Yeah we do.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah okay.  Well this is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna order.

PATIENT X299
Order the lab.

DOCTOR X299
Yep.

PATIENT X299
And do the x-rays.

DOCTOR X299
And do the x-rays.

PATIENT X299
And then just pick up medicines.

DOCTOR X299
And then pick up the medicines.

PATIENT X299
We can do that.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  So okay so I don't think anything else is going on but I think we need to just chat before you leave I mean just in case okay.

PATIENT X299
Yeah sure.

DOCTOR X299
And um.

SECOND PERSON X299
Did he tell you he quit smoking?

DOCTOR X299
He did, yep that's fantastic.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
That's fantastic.  I'll give you a standing ovation for that.  Um okay so I know this is kind of a lot of stuff but the final piece of the puzzle is well actually its two kind of pieces, we're still putting in for the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X299
Right.

DOCTOR X299
Okay so I'm going to put that in today, they'll call you, they'll schedule you.  It's not urgent but whenever they call you'll want to schedule it at your convenience okay.  So we'll put that in and then the final thing with this elevated white blood cell count is we're going to start treating you for this rash right, we're going to do the Selsun and everything and so how about in like three weeks you stop back in the Lab and get some blood drawn and we'll check and be sure that it's not going up inexplicably since your treating your rash it's coming back down.

PATIENT X299
Do I need to make an appointment?

DOCTOR X299
You don't need to make an appointment for that.

PATIENT X299
Just go in?

DOCTOR X299
I'll put the order in, whenever it's convenient for you, you just come on down and slip in.  Okay that's a lot of stuff to remember so.

PATIENT X299
So three week schedule.

SECOND PERSON X299
No I think its okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X299
Maybe I can come in like today @@@.

SECOND PERSON X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

PATIENT X299
Yeah okay.  Just write it on the calendar.

SECOND PERSON X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
The VA likes to @@@ about papers, we're printing on two sides of everything.  Alright let's see, alright I'm having a, what is this.  @@@.  Okay now we know you don't have diabetes, so you don't have to worry about that, @@@ note pad here.  So for your hand we're going to um @@@.

PATIENT X299
Would exercise kind of help you know, I could even dig out those little balls for stress.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
Start squeezing it and stuff like that.

DOCTOR X299
And they might and that's one of the things that the Rehab doctors are really good, kind of evaluating where they think this is coming from and what types of exercises and braces or things like that would be helpful so if you want to try, if you have like an exercise ball and you want to try it.

PATIENT X299
Tennis ball or something like that.

SECOND PERSON X299
I don't know.  @@@ really don't know the cause either but @@@.  His dad was an insulin-dependent.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X299
Several cervical @@@.

PATIENT X299
Yeah he died with lots of problems.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.  So maybe you know.

PATIENT X299
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.
DOCTOR X299
So if you can stop and get your chest x-ray I can see if they can do all the x-rays all at one time so you can just you know, it shouldn't add any extra time, well like maybe three extra minutes and then this will save you.  So I'll put in the orders here before you leave okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Um we're going to try the lotion.  Okay.  Around like St. xxx's Day, like the 16th or so okay.

PATIENT X299
Around the middle of the month.

DOCTOR X299
So the middle of March, so exactly three weeks is March 16th.  It does not have to be exactly but that is when you need to get your labs.

PATIENT X299
Give or take a couple days.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.  Okay.  So let me put these orders in and then you uh.

SECOND PERSON X299
In the clinic would you want @@@.

DOCTOR X299
Yes and it is totally normal.  It's great actually normal.

SECOND PERSON X299
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR X299
Total cholesterol is 165 alright and LDL which is the bad cholesterol is 78 and HDL which is the good cholesterol is 67.

SECOND PERSON X299
Okay.  Okay.  Well my cholesterol is 133.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
So I fix liver every month.

DOCTOR X299
Oh okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
I need the liver and he likes it, I want to make sure he can still do that.

DOCTOR X299
Yep you're looking good from that standpoint.  Really every other lab besides that.

PATIENT X299
White cell count.

DOCTOR X299
White cell count is stone cold normal.  So everything else is normal.  So let me just get these orders in so that you guys can leave and have everything ready for you okay so.  Let's get and no fevers or chills, night sweats or anything like that?

PATIENT X299
Well I have night sweats, but I might sweat a little bit more if I'm under the comforter when I'm sleeping.

DOCTOR X299
Like having to change your pajamas and your sheets at night type of night sweats or do you just get a little warm?  Okay.

PATIENT X299
Well there was a time one of my cats once in a while sleeps on our bed.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
And we went and got one of those pee pads you put on the mattress.

DOCTOR X299
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X299
You know like if a child pees and you know so he doesn't ruin the mattress.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

PATIENT X299
When that was on I would be sweating really a lot.

SECOND PERSON X299
We took it off.

PATIENT X299
It just may be impossible because they're off and I don't notice any night sweats.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  And that was your, left it's your left.

PATIENT X299
Left.

DOCTOR X299
Hand and right foot.

PATIENT X299
Every finger but the pinky.

DOCTOR X299
Okay.  So.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
Um I actually don't think so.  I think the Pharmacy is open for a while.

SECOND PERSON X299
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X299
Um.

PATIENT X299
Well I could go to the Pharmacy and you could go and give the blood.

SECOND PERSON X299
I'm not gonna give blood.  I'll get my own.

DOCTOR X299
Okay pick those up at the window, got that ordered, okay.  Alright so I probably won't get the chest x-ray back today.

SECOND PERSON X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
It's really not that big of a deal.  If you develop fevers or you know significant signs that make you think you have an infection you know give a call and let us know okay.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
In the meantime if there's anything on the chest x-ray that's concerning I'll call you.  It'll probably be Monday okay by the time I get it back.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
Okay good, good.  So and then I put in for this repeat.  I know this is going to sound strange and they should do this in advance but I'm just going to tell you to make sure, I put in this lab test for three weeks from now.

SECOND PERSON X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
I don't want them to draw that one okay.  They're just going to get the RPR which is the other lab test that the dermatologist wanted okay.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
So it's written for not to do it for three weeks but sometimes they just look and see so if you remember just say we don't want the CBC which is the blood test.

SECOND PERSON X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
We just the RPR.  But they should know that but just so you know have it in your head too.

PATIENT X299
RPR @@@.

DOCTOR X299
So okay.  I think that that's everything.  I still have to put in the nerve conduction study but you guys don't have to have that before you leave.  So does that all make sense to you and everything?

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
Cause that's kind of a lot of stuff for one day and then why don't you come back and see me and in a few months we'll see all of this stuff just kind of gets tidied up with all these other things happening.  If you don't need to see me again for I mean another six months do you want me to put in for three months and then when they call you to set up an appointment you can either say I don't need it.

PATIENT X299
Alright sure.

DOCTOR X299
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
In the meanwhile feel free to cancel or to not schedule if everything is going fine okay.

PATIENT X299
Uh-huh.  But if we cancel wait.
DOCTOR X299
It's six months so.

PATIENT X299
Six months and then just call up and say I'd like to make an appointment.

DOCTOR X299
And see me you know in like August or something like that.

PATIENT X299
Okay.

DOCTOR X299
Did you guys get one of my cards last time, I can't remember if I had them.

SECOND PERSON X299
I don't think so no.

DOCTOR X299
So three months to see me.  Alright.  Probably seems like a lot when you just came in for not that much stuff but we'll get you tidied up okay.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@ colonoscopy.

DOCTOR X299
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
Alright I think I already wrote it down.  I just wanted to make sure @@@.

PATIENT X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
They do.  Most people, you know what, have you ever; do ever read Dave Berry, have you ever heard of Dave Berry?

PATIENT X299
No.

DOCTOR X299
He's a @@@ columnist and he writes for the xxx xxx okay.  Uh and he is very funny um but he wrote about a colonoscopy because his best friend was his GI doctor who does the colonoscopies and he made him have a colonoscopy when he turned 50 and so he wrote about his experience having a colonoscopy and it's a very funny article you should xxx xxx xxx colonoscopy.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@ what was that, well what I need to do, I was the colon cancer screening nurse.

DOCTOR X299
Oh of course.

SECOND PERSON X299
@@@.

DOCTOR X299
Okay so you know, you know all of this so.

SECOND PERSON X299
I know colonoscopies for dummies.

DOCTOR X299
Colonoscopies for Dummies.  Dave Berry is hilarious because when he writes anything he thinks of funny @@@ so like he describes like his colon cleansing process @@@ he comes up with some funny bands names and he has a whole extensive description of the prep.

SECOND PERSON X299
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X299
And then he's like @@@ you know like he's so worried about the colonoscopy itself and then he's like I don't remember any of it.

SECOND PERSON X299
The prep is worse than the procedure.

DOCTOR X299
The prep is what people don't like.

SECOND PERSON X299
Right.  @@@.

DOCTOR X299
Anyway, here you go okay so.

PATIENT X299
Take care.

DOCTOR X299
So you got to check out.

PATIENT X299
Oh okay.  Thank you doctor.

DOCTOR X299
You are very welcome.  Have a good day.  Take care alright.  So you can go right out front here and just check out where you checked in okay.

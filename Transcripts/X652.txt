(DOCTOR OUT:  11:54  DOCTOR IN:  22:09)

DOCTOR X652
So you're saying you take the gout pills twice a month and you just take one pill twice a month?

PATIENT X652
No.

DOCTOR X652
Then what?

PATIENT X652
They changed it back to three.

DOCTOR X652
Okay.

PATIENT X652
Three pills.

DOCTOR X652
And that takes care of it when you have a gout attack?

PATIENT X652
It supposed, come sometimes it cools it off.

DOCTOR X652
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X652
But it didn't stop it all the time.

DOCTOR X652
Okay.  And have you ever been on a medicine that you take every day to help prevent gout attacks?

PATIENT X652
No.

DOCTOR X652
Um because there's a medicine called allopurinol that you can take one pill every day and it's supposed to help decrease the amount of uric acid in your body and uric acid is what causes gout attacks.

PATIENT X652
Oh.

DOCTOR X652
Would you like to start that pill to take to help prevent the gout attacks?  It’s one pill once a day and it helps your kidneys get rid of some of that extra uric acid in the body and that uric acid is what gets in your joints and can cause the gout flares.

PATIENT X652
Yeah.

DOCTOR X652
But it is one more pill you'd have to take every day.  It's not just the pill that you take when you have the gout attack.

PATIENT X652
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X652
It something you take every single day.

PATIENT X652
Okay, yeah.

DOCTOR X652
Okay and you want to pick it up today?

PATIENT X652
Yeah.

DOCTOR X652
Alright.

PATIENT X652
I want the magnesium.

DOCTOR X652
And the magnesium also.

PATIENT X652
Yeah.

DOCTOR X652
Okay.  Are those the only ones you're gonna pick up today?

PATIENT X652
Yeah.

DOCTOR X652
Okay.  So let me do that first.  Okay so those medicines will be at the Pharmacy today.

PATIENT X652
Okay.

DOCTOR X652
And let me go through all your other medicines and make sure you have enough refills left so you can call for it.  Okay.  Okay so it'll be at the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X652
Okay.

DOCTOR X652
And you don't need the shot.  You don't need a tetanus shot because you had one in 2003.

PATIENT X652
Okay oh.

DOCTOR X652
Okay so you got the tetanus shot, just eight years ago and you don't need a booster.

PATIENT X652
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X652
So you're gonna continue all your medicines and start this new one.  It's called allopurinol.

PATIENT X652
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X652
Just one pill once a day.

PATIENT X652

DOCTOR X697 
PATIENT.

PATIENT X697
How you doing?

DOCTOR X697
Good to see you again, hi.  @@@

PATIENT X697
Some lady gave me one of those tape recorders.

DOCTOR X697
Here we go right in there.  Sorry what was that?

PATIENT X697
They give me one of them tape recorders so.

DOCTOR X697
Oh they did.

PATIENT X697
Yeah.  Where do you want me to sit down?

DOCTOR X697
Uh right there is fine.  How are you doing today?

PATIENT X697
Uh so far so good.

DOCTOR X697
Okay um anything specific you wanted to discuss?  I know you were recently in the hospital so we'll talk about that but um anything else or have you been doing okay since you were discharged?

PATIENT X697
Uh I been doing pretty good all except my leg is hurting me more.

DOCTOR X697
The leg pain, still having that.

PATIENT X697
Yeah but @@@.

SECOND PERSON X697
It is not arthritis and I don't find, he's still having the pain but it is because that he, he won't let them take him @@@.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
And um it wasn't arthritis.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.  And I'm a little miffed; I'm little ticked because when we start to leave.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
Everything that I told you exhibited, I told him I have to rush him here and he was almost comatose and everything that I told them was, it was classic of hypothyroidism so sometime maybe you know remember to listen to the patient's, everything that I told you know don't and I understand this is @@@ deal.  See I been a nurse for a long time so I do understand it but perhaps, maybe not, but perhaps we could have alleviated this and we could have skirted it another way had you listened instead of just maybe sloughing it off and I, so I'm a little ticked.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
You understand?

DOCTOR X697
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X697
So it may not help him now but it may help someone else.

DOCTOR X697
No I understand that um.  Let me just fill something out there.  Yeah so the thing is the last time we had checked his thyroid studies were in March of 2010 and they were normal.

SECOND PERSON X697
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X697
I think if we don't routinely check those with patients if they're taking the medications and you know you told me about some of the pains and I'm trying to remember exactly what else we talked about last time.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
Um, you know you've been talking about the hip pain um and then I mean.  You know we talked about the medications.  I know there've been some questionable you know what he'd been taking and what he hadn't been but you know what else did we talk about that detail that may.

SECOND PERSON X697
We talked, I remember distinctly.  Remember I told you that the skin was acne.  I told you I said just look at his skin it's just taunt, black, he was having the tearing of the eyes because I think you got him the appointment to go see the eye doctor.  All of this is related to hypothyroidism you know so sometime, maybe you would think that normally, I think that maybe you all need to go the extra nine, just put one foot forward a little bit more and he was quite ill.  He was quite, I ran every light getting him here and had we waited a little longer maybe the results would not have been as good.  It may have been irreversible and that you don't get back.  That means I don't get him back you know so and I know you probably get enough from the attendings but sometimes the little guy that we're supposed to be taking care of we need to take that up.

DOCTOR X697
Sure.  So I do apologize that we missed that.  You know like I said we had checked the labs just you know a year ago and everything was normal and you know I didn't really have any reason to believe he wasn't taking the Synthroid that we were having issues or you know the thing with hypothyroidism a lot of times it is, it you know in retrospect sure, you can look it up and say these are classic symptoms.

SECOND PERSON X697
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X697
But you know it does present very vaguely and you know if you think you can find reasons for those symptoms it's not necessarily the first thing cause a lot of these disease processes present very vaguely.

SECOND PERSON X697
Certainly.

DOCTOR X697
You know in retrospect it is easy to say you know I missed it but we didn't really have any reason to believe that that was the number one thing because you didn't tell me that he hadn't been taking the Synthroid and you know the lab had just been checked in a year but I do apologize.  I'm glad you know that they were able to catch that in the ER and that was taken care of.

SECOND PERSON X697
Yeah it can't be undone; we just go forward with it.  But I think that sometimes the top professionals we forget, we all get tired.

DOCTOR X697
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X697
We all have to remember you know there's this thing about do no harm and sometimes you know when we don't do anything it causes harm.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.  That's true.

SECOND PERSON X697
You know so I can only speak from this side.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
Because he's my number one priority.

DOCTOR X697
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X697
And I knew something was wrong with him you know for a long time.  Okay we're gonna go forward, I said my peace.

DOCTOR X697
Okay well how are you doing since you were discharged from the hospital?

PATIENT X697
Well pretty good so far.

DOCTOR X697
Okay, you're taking the Synthroid.

SECOND PERSON X697
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X697
Okay good.  Symptoms seem to be, are you still having the pain here?

PATIENT X697
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X697
Kind of the back part of the leg here?

PATIENT X697
Yeah.

DOCTOR X697
Is it just starting up in the hip or is it just kind of localized?

PATIENT X697
Uh it moved down here.  It's not over there no more.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

PATIENT X697
I don't know if it's because of my water.

DOCTOR X697
You have it on both sides or just on the one side?

PATIENT X697
Both sides when I wake up in the morning.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

PATIENT X697
After about after an hour and a half it'll go away.

SECOND PERSON X697
But he did get this one the other night.

PATIENT X697
But it just seemed like, it seemed like @@@ a water in the car I call it you know.

DOCTOR X697
Does it go all the way down your leg or does it stop?

PATIENT X697
Right here on the side, right here.

DOCTOR X697
Cause you know like I think we traumatized this leg and it could be you know a nerve, kind of a nerve pain that with some compression.

PATIENT X697
That's what it feels like.  It feel like the nerve you know.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.  And that's why you know I kind of wanted to start with the head CT if anything was getting compressed there, if there were any bony abnormalities.  I don't think those were ever done correct?  Yeah but I think actually we talked about it but I saw those were not done.  Um you know if it, is there a weakness or just kind of a pain?

PATIENT X697
It's a pain you know when you stand up.  You feel a pain there when you walk, you gotta walk stiffly so instead of it straightens out.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  Yeah I mean, we could if we want to pursue I think we could still take a look and see if there's anything here.  Otherwise if we, you know there's other things we could do.  We could do nerve conduction studies.

PATIENT X697
Well.

DOCTOR X697
Those are a little more invasive and I don't think that's necessary.

PATIENT X697
If you don't catch me when I first get up you know about an hour and a half later, it's not there so, nothing to catch.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  So I mean I think it could be even though you're sleeping all night you're putting pressure here and that could be something and then once you get up.

PATIENT X697
That's what I thought.  It's easing up now.  I was sleeping on the couch, watching TV.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

PATIENT X697
And uh that's when I stopped sleeping on the couch and getting in bed.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X697
So if I sleep in the bed it don't get as bad with sleeping in the bed.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

PATIENT X697
I figured it might because of the couch thing @@@ you know with two of the pillows.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X697
So I figured maybe the pillow, just changing the pillow that might be doing it.

SECOND PERSON X697
I'm just gonna tell him yeah no that's not it.  We just need a number bed, that's all we need is a number bed.  Now that's what I'm gonna put it on.  I'm holding out for the number bed.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
Fine.

DOCTOR X697
Sure, otherwise the other thing looking through the hospital, you know the discharge summary and I'm sure they talked about doing all the imaging studies.  There's also cysts on your kidneys.

SECOND PERSON X697
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X697
Hmm.

DOCTOR X697
Um there was one on the left kidney that they wanted you know that may need further work-up just to make sure it's not growing or it’s not.

SECOND PERSON X697
It's more than one.

DOCTOR X697
Well there was one specific.

PATIENT X697
I know there's one they were worried about.

DOCTOR X697
Yeah he had one multiple small ones but there was one specific on the left kidney that they want a follow-up on you know in terms of re-imaging.

SECOND PERSON 421
They will, but they will in maybe two months.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.  Yeah obviously not now but I'm saying that is one thing that we'll need to make sure we follow up on.

SECOND PERSON X697
Yes.

DOCTOR X697
So you know make sure it’s not growing or you now anything other than just a simple cyst.

SECOND PERSON X697
Yes.

DOCTOR X697
A lot of people have had you know simple cysts in the kidneys with not much to do there but.

SECOND PERSON X697
No what he said was on the right there is one, no problem, don't worry about it.  The left side it's the one that is, he was telling us bothersome and capsuled.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
So for a, he seemed not to have heard it.  I've heard everything that the doctor said.  He kept looking for more; I guess he was waiting until I finally told him I understood.  He said he didn't tell me that.  I'm telling him yes he did.

DOCTOR X697
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON X697
Yes he did, so would you tell him?

DOCTOR X697
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X697
What he said.
DOCTOR X697
Yeah I mean the thing is, you can't just right now but the reason we want to recheck is to make sure it’s not growing because then you're concerned for cancer.  You know we do a follow-up study and if it looks exactly the same in a couple of months then we're kind of reassured that it is just a cyst.

SECOND PERSON X697
Yeah.

DOCTOR X697
But if it has grown then we get a little bit worried that is this a cancerous lesions, do we need to get a biopsy, do we need further studies but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.  Um but you know in a month or two, probably in two months, you know we'll monitor.

PATIENT X697
I think he said in three.

DOCTOR X697
Yeah so, so I mean that was kind of in the middle, end of November so we'll say around February maybe we'll get a repeat CT scan and see how that looks.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

PATIENT X697
I need to get moved.

SECOND PERSON X697
We're gonna be moving on the 9th of January.

DOCTOR X697
Yeah I saw that as well um.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay he's doing thousands.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  So going back to kind of cause you know now knowing that you know there were issues with the medications in the past, what was, how can we prevent that from happening again?  What was the exact issue with not able to get the medication or not taking the medication?

PATIENT X697
Most likely it'd be not taking cause I got plenty of medicine.

SECOND PERSON X697
And I think his stomach was bothering him.  @@@ we and his stomach was bothering him because he wasn't taking the Synthroid and I think that was the issue that we were not aware of because now that he takes it every morning he hasn't had no problems with his stomach.

DOCTOR X697
He hasn't had a problem okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
No @@@.

DOCTOR X697
And taking the medicine every day.

SECOND PERSON X697
Every day, every morning, every morning.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  Well that's gonna be the key.

SECOND PERSON X697
At 5 o'clock.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
He's up, so he's doing good.

DOCTOR X697
Okay good.  Any other problems today?

PATIENT X697
Yeah I want to know how many beers can I drink a day.

DOCTOR X697
What's that?

PATIENT X697
How many beers can I drink a day?

DOCTOR X697
Drink?

SECOND PERSON X697
The doctor told him one.

DOCTOR X697
Good.

SECOND PERSON X697
One beer a day.

DOCTOR X697
Oh one beer year.

SECOND PERSON X697
He drinks that.  You're not gonna stop him at one but he still gets.

PATIENT X697
Three.

SECOND PERSON X697
No.

PATIENT X697
One every hour.

SECOND PERSON X697
No.

DOCTOR X697
No.  It's better to cut down.

PATIENT X697
Not cut off though.

DOCTOR X697
Well he said one a day; I think that's probably the right amount.

PATIENT X697
That's not.

SECOND PERSON X697
He drinks but.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
Because he's not gonna do one.

DOCTOR X697
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON X697
But he'll.

DOCTOR X697
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X697
You're not gonna stop him at one so you have to have a cut off somewhere.  When the doctor told him three, he told him that is enough.

DOCTOR X697
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON X697
So he does drink two a day and I don't.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  The thing I mean you know we can tell you what we recommend.  Obviously you know you go home and you know it's kind of up to you to go.  I think one or two is probably okay but I would try to cut down to one and eventually, if possible to zero but like I said I know that's a.

PATIENT X697
What about wine then?

DOCTOR X697
You can have one glass of wine a day, that's good.  One glass of red wine a day is good for your heart.

PATIENT X697
One glass of red wine and two glasses of beer?

DOCTOR X697
One or the other.
PATIENT X697
Oh shit.

SECOND PERSON X697
So take the two beers, take the two beers and I'll tell you he went to a birthday celebration.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
And I think he had, that day, I think he had three.  For him that particular day, because it was a celebration he just kind of had to skirt it a little bit.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
But now we back to okay, back to the two.

DOCTOR X697
Okay good.

SECOND PERSON X697
And he's been doing good.  He's real interested in trying.

DOCTOR X697
Good.

SECOND PERSON X697
I know that he's really been trying.  He is not happy.

DOCTOR X697
I can tell.  I can tell his attitude with it.

SECOND PERSON X697
But he's really been trying.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
You know I worry but he's really been doing good and I know it's hard.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
You know but my problem is to try to keep him here and keep him happy.

DOCTOR X697
Uh-huh.  That's good, that's really good.  Otherwise anything but you know I just, we just saw him you know a month ago.  Everything looks good since then.  Blood pressure you know @@@ initially it was a little high it was 151/55 but they rechecked it 134/63 and then I read they wrote on here did not take blood pressure medicine this morning is that true?

SECOND PERSON X697
Yes he did.

PATIENT X697
Did I?

SECOND PERSON X697
Yes.

PATIENT X697
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
He took it.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

PATIENT X697
That's that little bitty pill?

SECOND PERSON X697
Yeah where's the blue pill?

PATIENT X697
I think I must left it outside.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay, yes the pills are in there.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
They are in there.

PATIENT X697
So I did take all my pills.

DOCTOR X697
Yeah I mean 134/63.

SECOND PERSON X697
It's really good.

DOCTOR X697
And maybe he set it up.

SECOND PERSON X697
And then I make him take his afternoon, it’s a little bitty pill is the tamsulosin that I give him @@@.

DOCTOR X697
Okay. Yeah so that's an important one, not to miss that @@@ you know so.

SECOND PERSON X697
Yeah.

DOCTOR X697
Uh okay do you want to sit up here for me?  Lean back here.  I'll try not to splash on it.

SECOND PERSON X697
It's temporary.

DOCTOR X697
Okay breathe normally for me alright.  Okay.  Nice deep breath for me in and out through your mouth for me.  Okay again, one more okay good.  Okay any pain down here anywhere?

PATIENT X697
Not yet no.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  Any swelling?

SECOND PERSON X697
No that's fine.

DOCTOR X697
Okay.  Great.  Uh let me go talk to DOCTOR, I'll be back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  20:25  DOCTOR IN:  28:58)

DOCTOR X697
Okay so a couple of things.  So I saw you have an appointment coming up in January with the Endocrine, right January 3rd.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
But we'll check the thyroid levels, this way before that, I mean we only check about six weeks or so after adjusting the dose or restarting the dose so.

SECOND PERSON X697
@@@ dose that they gave him right.

DOCTOR X697
Well no cause they started him again on November 19th when he was admitted.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
So this puts us at about a month so six weeks will kind of be the end of this month, end of December.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
Um so we'll check it.  That appointment's on the 3rd at 2:30 p.m.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
So you guys could come in the morning and get that drawn so that'll give it enough time to get the tests back or maybe the day before or is that.

PATIENT X697
Probably that morning.

DOCTOR X697
Kind of hard.

SECOND PERSON X697
Maybe in the morning.

DOCTOR X697
Maybe just that same day.  Just come a couple of hours before your appointment so you have time to kind of run to the Lab.

PATIENT X697
What's that appointment?

DOCTOR X697
I think that one for 2:30 um.

PATIENT X697
@@@.

DOCTOR X697
So that way you know just come in the morning, get the blood test done.  Cause that way you're gonna see that you know the thyroid specialist eventually so they can look at the numbers and if they need to adjust the dose then they can decide.  Um the CT scan I think we'll go ahead and do in February cause they said about three months.  So I'll put it in the computer now and then I want to see you back in about three months.  Does that sound okay?  So just before the appointment with me just come in and get the CT scan done and if the cyst has grown, if we need to you know.

SECOND PERSON X697
You'll see it then.

DOCTOR X697
Yeah exactly.  So we'll have some answers before next time.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
Um otherwise I think everything else is okay cause you know everything we talked about last time um so I think those are kind of our big issues to focus on now and make sure the thyroid levels are responding you know appropriately and that cyst on the kidney has not grown.  So is that okay?

PATIENT X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
Okay so I'll put those in the computer so just the day of the Endocrine appointment, come in a little bit early to get your blood drawn and you guys know where to do that right by the entrance and then you'll schedule the appointment with me, I think they'll send you something in the mail and have you go and before that appointment I'll put the CT scan order in already so you can just come in a couple days before and get the CT scan done.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
So that sound good?

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

DOCTOR X697
Any questions?

PATIENT X697
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X697
Okay great.  So we'll see you back in three months and I'm glad to see you're doing better okay.  Just take that to the front desk.

PATIENT X697
Okay and they give me all the appointments again huh?

DOCTOR X697
Yeah the only appointment we're really scheduling is with me because the Endocrine's already scheduled um and I'll put in you know for the blood tests and CT scan, I just put that in the computer.

SECOND PERSON X697
Uh-huh.  What they do is when they give him another appointment they run them all again which is fine.

DOCTOR X697
Oh okay.

SECOND PERSON X697
They just keep them in running order which is fine; you don't have to keep this one here and that one there.

DOCTOR X697
You've kind of got everything.

SECOND PERSON X697
Everything is put into order.  So it's better.

DOCTOR X697
It's a great system in this place here huh.

SECOND PERSON X697
It is.  It's a little hard to get to them but it's really good now.

DOCTOR X697
Yeah, good.  Yeah I'm glad.  Well alright then we will see you back in a couple months and of course if anything comes, you know if anything happens sooner.

SECOND PERSON X697
I know.

DOCTOR X697
Come back.

SECOND PERSON X697
I know that too.

DOCTOR X697
Before that.  Yeah if you can't get an appointment here the ER or Urgent Care.

SECOND PERSON X697
Yes.

DOCTOR X697
But you know.

SECOND PERSON X697
Okay.

PATIENT X697
Okay doc.

SECOND PERSON X697
Alright thank you.

DOCTOR X697
Alright.  Have a good day.  It's good to see you again.

PATIENT X697
Alright, that'll do it.

SECOND PERSON X697
Did you get all your Christmas shopping done?

DOCTOR X697
Not yet, not yet.

SECOND PERSON X697
You've got to get it done.

DOCTOR X697
Yeah right.

SECOND PERSON X697

PATIENT X697
You waiting around.  Yeah @@@ went to the mall.

SECOND PERSON X697

DOCTOR X697

PATIENT LEAVES:  32:22

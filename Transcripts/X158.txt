Yes it is.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
He told me it was itchy.

PATIENT X158
It's itchy.  Actually it's burning and painful.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
It's burning and painful.

PATIENT X158
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
The back is the area that looks kind of like the stomach.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
It's not shingles.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
But even if they've healed, like they.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Have you tried um hydrocortisone cream on the back here?

FIRST DOCTOR X158
The main one is the neck and these ones right here are as itchy as much as the neck ones right?

PATIENT X158
They all burn.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Let me see @@@.  @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Yeah.  @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Have you seen the dermatologist?

PATIENT X158
No.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
You've been really scratching here?

PATIENT X158
Yeah @@@.  Itches and burns so bad.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Yeah.

PATIENT X158
Ooh.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
How much, have you been scratching constantly at the stomach?

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Does it look red do you think?

FIRST DOCTOR X158
It looks red here.  Cause it looks like he's scratching right here.  We're going to put your legs up, hold up.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
How long has it been here?

PATIENT X158
About for three weeks.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
You're more tender now?

PATIENT X158
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
@@@ tender.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Let me see here.  Do you put hydrocortisone on this area?  You don't put hydrocortisone anywhere?  Where do you put the hydrocortisone?

PATIENT X158
I put it on my belly.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Here right?

PATIENT X158
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
The other one you're putting Nystatin on.

PATIENT X158
Yes.  Try to keep it dry.

(Doctors are talking between themselves)

SECOND DOCTOR X158
So you put clotrimazole on here and Nystatin on here and it did not work?

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Or just the Nystatin.

PATIENT X158
I just put the @@@ on it.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Did you put the clotrimazole?

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Yes historically he has @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Oh for the same thing or something for different?

PATIENT X158
I just put @@@ this keeps going through.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
But the clotrimazole, where did you put that?

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Historically.  You've had two medications.

PATIENT X158
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
One the Nystatin historically but then you also had another one that was a cream.

PATIENT X158
Yeah the cream.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
@@@.

PATIENT X158
Yeah I stopped putting the cream.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Why?

PATIENT X158
It kept it too moist and it kept it itchy.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Did it make it better?

PATIENT X158
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
No.  I don't think this is fungal.  I think it's something totally different.  I think we should try a little topical steroid and get him in to see Dermatology because they may need to biopsy this.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
@@@ for dermatitis from this.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
This kind of treat him like that.

PATIENT X158
And there's just a lot of fluid that's been coming out of it.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
So what I would do is I would give him like @@@ cream 1%.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Apply that twice a day and right in the small of your back, is it itchy?

PATIENT X158
It's burning and itchy.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Burning and itchy.

PATIENT X158
Oh burning yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Burning.  It's been right at his belt line right?

PATIENT X158
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Oh.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
@@@ that's where it is. @@@ in his pants line too and a little bit higher.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
So let's, what so, even if it's diffuse if you're putting the medicine on it, I think it should have gotten better.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
So I'm want to, @@@ so if you've only been putting the steroids @@@ and does your back get better with the steroids @@@?

PATIENT X158
Just a little bit.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Okay, let's put, I'm going to give you some different steroids for here and on your back twice a day.  I want to get you into Dermatology.

PATIENT X158
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
And ask them.  Now the problem that I see is that if it becomes infected.  Now see some of these lesions that are open and weeping and what happens is that bacteria comes in and causes infection.  Do you know what that feels like?  It will be stinky, fevers, chills.

PATIENT X158
That's what I'm getting, fevers.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
@@@.  You're getting fevers, how high?

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Well he's not; he says he feels like his skin feels hot.

PATIENT X158
I just get very hot and it's like I get hot all over.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Yeah hot all over.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Let's um, yeah let's just try.  Looks like you're allergic to something.  I don't know what it is.

PATIENT X158

FIRST DOCTOR X158
You're not; you said you're just using Dove soap which is not new.

PATIENT X158
No.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
You didn't add and you don't have any new detergents you said in your household either, nothing new that's come in contact with you.

PATIENT X158
Nothing I could think of.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
And you didn't switch combs; you didn't switch baths, nothing that corresponds to the timing of this?

PATIENT X158
Uh I switched one of the bedrooms to the basement.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Is there anything different with what you used, the bedding, the sheets that corresponds to the change?

PATIENT X158
I'm using different sheets and different blankets.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
I don't think it would be sheet care or those blankets could even be a little.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Yeah.  Okay.

PATIENT X158
I'm going to investigate to see if something is different down there.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Do you think it you moved down there at the same time that this popped up?

PATIENT X158
No.

FIRST DOCTOR X158
Okay let me uh help you up.  Just 1%.

PATIENT X158

SECOND DOCTOR X158
And what did they look like when they were first on your back; did they look like a pustule?

FIRST DOCTOR X158

PATIENT X158
Well they come and seem like they just came and disappeared and over here they seem like they new.

SECOND DOCTOR X158
Oh.  Is this something different?  Was this a different rash?

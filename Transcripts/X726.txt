DOCTOR X726
What's that?

PATIENT X726
They hear everything.  You're being recorded.

DOCTOR X726
Okay, that's fine.  Alright, so how are you been doing since the last time I saw you?

PATIENT X726
Okay.  I'm doing fine.  I'm about to have surgery.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah I saw you, you saw a lot of doctors since the last time I saw you.

PATIENT X726
You got that so.  I'm getting to see you to set all that in motion.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  What do you mean?

PATIENT X726
Uh I have to get my primary care doctor to go take an x-ray.

DOCTOR X726
Okay for the, for the neurosurgeons?

PATIENT X726
Right.

DOCTOR X726
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X726
So whatever's the case but they wanted me to have this before the surgery, presurgery stuff that they.  I mean they got to do that part but they wanted me to have, it's usually I'm here whatever they wanted me to do but I.

DOCTOR X726
Are they at xxx where you saw them?

PATIENT X726
Right exactly.

DOCTOR X726
Okay so that's not gonna be anything necessarily.  Let me see if I could uh.

PATIENT X726
There's something you had to do I forgot what.

DOCTOR X726
Did they want a Cardiology?

PATIENT X726
Right, there you go.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  Unfortunately I have to send you to another doctor for that.

PATIENT X726
You have to send me to another doctor for that?

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.  It's just that well this is the xxx xxx xxx right.

PATIENT X726
Right.

DOCTOR X726
So your Cardiology Clinic does things with the cardiologists unfortunately.  Is there a particular reason they wanted it?

SECOND PERSON X726
He had a heart attack.

DOCTOR X726
He had a heart attack.

PATIENT X726
Right around Christmas.

SECOND PERSON X726
On the 23rd.

PATIENT X726
I didn't come to this hospital I had you know I went to uh.

SECOND PERSON X726
To Christ's.

DOCTOR X726
Oh you were at the Christ okay.  Did they put any stent in?

PATIENT X726
No stents they gave me a thing where they go into your groin @@@.

DOCTOR X726
Oh a cardiac cath.

PATIENT X726
They did that, found no blockage, none of that.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
No.

DOCTOR X726
Why did they think you had a heart attack then?

PATIENT X726
They didn't say.  I probably was stressed out @@@.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.

PATIENT X726
I'd seen the doctors the day before that and they gave me all this stuff about this leg, that's what started all this @@@.

DOCTOR X726
Gotcha, gotcha, okay.  So you had a car, so that cath was in December right?

PATIENT X726
That was yeah, December probably 22nd.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
I got out of the hospital on Christmas.

DOCTOR X726
Okay and so the reason they did the cath was because you were having chest pain?

PATIENT X726
Right, real bad chest pain.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
And they said I had an abnormal chest.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
And there was no blood tests they couldn't do it, it hurt.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  And your cath was normal.

PATIENT X726
Right.  And that was normal, they said no damage to the heart, nothing was abnormal.

DOCTOR X726
So what it sounds like to me, it sounds like you didn't actually have a heart attack.

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X726
Um sounds like you could have, that's the reason they did it is because they were concerned that you did.

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X726
But they didn't find any evidence that you had a heart attack.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
You didn't have any heart blockages.  It could have just been chest pain from something else.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Um also that's hard to say because you're you know you're fit.

PATIENT X726
I'm in shape.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah exactly.  Um none the less I understand why the surgeons would kind of hesitant.

PATIENT X726
Okay.  I didn't tell him that.  

DOCTOR X726
Why you didn't tell then, I don't know where.

PATIENT X726
I didn't tell him about the heart thing, DOCTOR.  I didn't even tell him that.  I don't know where he knew anything about it.

DOCTOR X726
Let me see.

PATIENT X726
Oh it might be in the @@@.

SECOND PERSON X726
In their notes.  Yeah it's in there.

PATIENT X726
Yeah I told them.  I told the EMG they were in there.

DOCTOR X726
Okay so you just, I see it.  Yeah they didn't say they wanted a Cardiology clearance.  They just said preop medical clearance.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Oh yeah so since you had, actually you don't need to see your cardiologist necessarily because since you had that test that's the ultimate definite test for you know your heart disease.

PATIENT X726
Right.

DOCTOR X726
And you had it and it was normal so.

PATIENT X726
Sent me home and I don't have to.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah so I think that's fine.  Um we're up here that let's just make sure all your other medicines are well optimized here.  

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Your blood pressure looks good.  Your heart rate looks good.  Are you taking all of your medicines?

PATIENT X726
Except the gem something.

DOCTOR X726
Gemfibrozil?

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X726
Why is that?

PATIENT X726
Uh yeah I think this is for cholesterol right?

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.

PATIENT X726
I got real scared of cholesterol medicines since I had that.

DOCTOR X726
Right.

PATIENT X726
@@@ before.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.

PATIENT X726
And if somebody said cholesterol medicine I, that was the worst feeling, I was having those cramps.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.

PATIENT X726
@@@ that day.

DOCTOR X726
I just had some but this medicine, this is why, cause I knew about it that's why I started you on a different type of medicine.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Totally different class.  It doesn't have the same type.  Sometimes the only side effects you really have is kind of a weird taste.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Um some people get a little bit of a stomach upset.

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X726
But you don't, you don't get those side effects like you got from the statin drugs like the Lipitor, things like that.

PATIENT X726
Right the cramps.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah you don't get those kinds of side effects.

PATIENT X726
Okay well I'll take it.

DOCTOR X726
But you haven't taken it at all huh?

PATIENT X726
I wasn't no.

DOCTOR X726
You don't okay.

PATIENT X726
Okay.  I tell you that, that's the worst feeling I've ever had in my life.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah I get that, I understand okay.  

PATIENT X726
But I will start that so, if you say that.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah that's why I hope I mean I probably didn't explain it to you as well last time.  But that's why yeah; you know you should never get that other statin because you've had.

PATIENT X726
Right.

DOCTOR X726
A bad side effect before.  Are you having any, do you have any chest pain at all or anything like that since you had it that one time?

PATIENT X726
No.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  Any shortness of breath?

PATIENT X726
No.

DOCTOR X726
Okay um coughing anything like that?

PATIENT X726
No.

DOCTOR X726
Okay and your dizziness I understand is about the weakness.  The weakness is about the same?

PATIENT X726
Oh the weakness oh yeah that's about the same.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
Yeah that's in my legs and stuff there.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
And that's why I'm having surgery so it possibly don't get any worse.

DOCTOR X726
Right.

PATIENT X726
They talking two different things that could be the cause of it but if I don't @@@ possibly to stop it, it's just gonna get worse regardless so they say the decompression will stop it from getting any worse.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
If that, indeed is the cause and not the neuropathy.

DOCTOR X726
Right exactly, exactly.  They feel, the way I understand it, they feel that it would be better if you had the surgery.

PATIENT X726
Right.

DOCTOR X726
And it might stop the progress of it.

PATIENT X726
Right.

DOCTOR X726
That's what they're saying.

PATIENT X726
Yeah.

DOCTOR X726
Which is their reason for it.

PATIENT X726
It is.

DOCTOR X726
It could possibly do but you also the fact that it might not.

PATIENT X726
Not be I know yeah but I got to.

DOCTOR X726
There is the risk of surgery.

PATIENT X726
Yeah.

DOCTOR X726
Um okay.  So I was just looking through your medicines.  You do have an albuterol inhaler ordered.

PATIENT X726
Right.

DOCTOR X726
How often do you use that?

PATIENT X726
Hmm maybe once a week.

DOCTOR X726
Once a week okay.  Who gave that to you?

PATIENT X726
Uh I think you might have.

DOCTOR X726
Uh no, I think it was the doctor before me.

PATIENT X726
Okay right.

DOCTOR X726
Okay and uh.

PATIENT X726
I know I take it when I need it.

DOCTOR X726
Were you wheezing?

PATIENT X726
No just something like that.

DOCTOR X726
That's okay.  Did you ever have, have you ever had lung tests done or anything like that?

PATIENT X726
I think I had something for it, @@@.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  How far can you walk before you get, I know you have this pain and everything.

PATIENT X726
@@@ I don't get out of breath.  It's not getting out of breath walking.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
It's just @@@.

DOCTOR X726
Were you a smoker in the past?

PATIENT X726
Some years ago.

DOCTOR X726
How long did you smoke for?  How many years?

PATIENT X726
Okay 20 years ago @@@.

SECOND PERSON X726
41.

PATIENT X726
So I started smoking at 18.

DOCTOR X726
So you smoked for 25 years.

PATIENT X726
Yes.

DOCTOR X726
Okay so I think, I looked back and I couldn't find any lung function tests at all.

PATIENT X726
No.

DOCTOR X726
I think it's reasonable to maybe repeat those.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
But you only use that inhaler once or twice a week you said.

PATIENT X726
Right.  I just want to make sure I've got it.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
Just to be safe, make sure I have it.

DOCTOR X726
That's fine.  So we can do those lung function tests later.  You don't have to have them before your surgery or anything like that.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
I don't think it's a crushing issue.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Um and then you're doing okay with your cholesterol medicine?

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X726
The @@@.

PATIENT X726
Yes.

DOCTOR X726
@@@ and limiting your salt okay.

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.  Just @@@ at the end of the year, he had a pinch.  You better hurry up.

DOCTOR X726
Understandable.  Understandable.  Alright.  And now the one that @@@ this day, you said your test was like Friday?

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X726
Okay well you might have to, can, do you think you can get those records from Christ?

PATIENT X726
I think so.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
But you probably could get them before I could.

DOCTOR X726
From Christ.  Okay we could try to.

PATIENT X726
But they got them, when I went them they got all my records from here like in the middle of the night almost.

DOCTOR X726
Right, right, maybe because they faxed them over.  Okay.

PATIENT X726
If you want to do it that way I don't know.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah I think, well we don't actually need them cause I can document it and that's fine for now because the surgeons.

PATIENT X726
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X726
Will want to see them.  Do you have like a pre-appointment with them or anything?

PATIENT X726
Not yet when I see you.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.

PATIENT X726
Then I call her today and then she'll make all the preop things.

DOCTOR X726
Okay so yeah I think what I would do is try to get it from them, just so you have them.  We don't need them here, we're fine.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
But as far as they need them but they should be able to give it to you without a problem.

PATIENT X726
Okay I'll get it.

DOCTOR X726
Just say you had a negative test and things like that.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
And that'll make it, that'll make it easier for everybody.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Okay so they're not asking you like why.

PATIENT X726
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X726
What the results were and things like that.  Any other problems at all today?

PATIENT X726
Uh like itching.  I have dry skin but man I just break out itching all over.  I get hot and itchy all over.

DOCTOR X726
Hmm.

PATIENT X726
Um once a week isn't it and I got dry skin cream but it's not doing it, I mean it itches and it's driving me crazy.

DOCTOR X726
Hmm.  Have you ever had that before?

PATIENT X726
Not like that.  It's been, it's been doing it for a while now but I've never asked about it or said anything about it, I just thought it was dry skin or the detergent that I was using.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.

PATIENT X726
You know those kind of things.

DOCTOR X726
Any rashes at all anywhere?

PATIENT X726
I don't know if you call this a rash, it be almost like that.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah I think that's probably from scratching.

PATIENT X726
Yeah that's what I think.

DOCTOR X726
Do you think you have some dry skin maybe?

PATIENT X726
Yeah I do have dry skin and I have medicine for it but that itches sometime.  I do put a cream on it and it stops it.

DOCTOR X726
Do you put it on every day?

PATIENT X726
No.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  I think what I would try first before we do anything else is try to use it every day.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Even if you're not itchy it'll kind of help you with the itchiness.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  Just know you need it every day.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
And then.

PATIENT X726
I'll be very ashy if I don't use it every day, you can write, I could take my finger and I could write on my whole leg.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah I mean the dry skin probably that's what happens it kind of feeds itself.

PATIENT X726
Okay.

DOCTOR X726
Okay.  Let's have you sit up here, I'll take a look at you.

PATIENT X726
There we go.  

DOCTOR X726
Any bowel or bladder or incontinence symptoms?

PATIENT X726
No.

DOCTOR X726
Okay I know that probably everybody asks you that.

PATIENT X726
Everybody asks because that's the first doctor told me what I'm having now could cause that.

DOCTOR X726
Right I understand @@@.

PATIENT X726
@@@ after the surgery like big time.

DOCTOR X726
Yeah.

PATIENT X726
@@@.  I don't want that.  I take everything else but I don't want that.

DOCTOR X726
Deep breath.  Any leg swelling at all or anything like that?

PATIENT X726
No they're not swollen.

DOCTOR X726
You have a seat there.  

PATIENT X726

DOCTOR X726

DOCTOR X726
Okay.

PATIENT X726
It's going to be kind of bang bang to get it through.  It was scheduled for last month until we discovered about the neurosurgeon relooked at my leg and said now what's going on here so we eventually decided to do the EMG and stuff.

DOCTOR X726

DOCTOR X726
Yeah so I'll put it in my note the one we have, like I said call over at Christ to get those cath records.

PATIENT X726

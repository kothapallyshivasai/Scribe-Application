DOCTOR X664
Uh-huh.  Let me pull it up and see what it showed up here.  @@@.  Okay so you had a CAT scan done because you @@@ no that was good.  Then they thought maybe you had um an echo that looked a little abnormal so that's why they got the MRA and that was normal.

PATIENT X664
Oh you know what I haven't even taken it for, for a long time.  You know what I mean, I mean I can take it for a while and then I didn't take it for a while.

Get crazy and red and I looked you know, @@@ more gross and ugly.

DOCTOR X664
@@@, the Naproxen and then the Xanax.  Okay so we'll get you start off with kind, okay so we can definitely put you back on the cholesterol medicine for sure.  That'll be an easy one for us to order, @@@.  Uh do you think that the Cymbalta was helping?

PATIENT X664
Uh yeah you know what after I'd been on it, yeah because I was having so many aches and pains I mean I just things were popping and just hurting you know for now reason, I didn't understand it you know but that seemed to help but.

DOCTOR X664
And you were taking @@@

PATIENT X664
Yeah I've been off that for quite a while too.

DOCTOR X664
That uh, at the VA, because of our formulary, they might have been @@@ to see it.  Let's @@@ we will obviously put in a referral for you to go see them and then let's see here.  Well we can put you back on the lisinopril instead of this combination pill for sure.

PATIENT X664
Is that one for the pressures or?

DOCTOR X664
No the blood pressure, the guy you saw the other day put you on a different blood pressure medicine but we can switch you back on your same home blood pressure medicine and then yeah the Actos caused, the Actos 2 um, it looks like we put in a special request for but that's totally fine so we'll put that in uh Pharmacy non-formulary request.  Yeah of 15 mg by mouth 30 pills with 3 refills by mail.  Diabetes saw previous recommend lisinopril.  Okay, good.  So we're gonna try to get the ball rolling here on the Actos and do you have a glucometer at home?

PATIENT X664
Yeah.

DOCTOR X664
Okay good.

PATIENT X664
Um so I can check my blood sugars.

DOCTOR X664
Okay so we'll put in for the @@@.  So let's see what we have here under.

PATIENT X664
Yeah they gave me one.

DOCTOR X664
Do you know precision provider do you think cause I'm only allowed to refer precision @@@.

PATIENT X664
Uh it's one of those television software uh, they went ahead and gave me yeah I had trouble with it.

DOCTOR X664
But yeah I'll put in an order for these strips and if they're the wrong ones.

PATIENT X664
I'll just send it back.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah you send them back.

PATIENT X664
Yeah.

DOCTOR X664
And then we can have the pharmacist help you figure out what.

PATIENT X664
Yeah I know there's one all around you don't have to calibrate and @@@ so I got it empty.

DOCTOR X664
Alright I'll.

PATIENT X664
They get @@@.

DOCTOR X664
Let me see if they have @@@ on our formulary here too and I'll just in a special request for that also.  Okay everything @@@.

PATIENT X664
And I take @@@ units but I feel it didn't make it.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah.  Just get a @@@.  Let's see if they have that or I'll just put in a non-formulary.  Yeah, well let me see if I can put in.  @@@ another medication in the same.

PATIENT X664
Category.

DOCTOR X664
@@@ yeah so let's see if we did, no I think it'll let you in, so let's see what else is @@@ itself @@@.  So how, is your like, so have you been taking the penicillin since you were last seen?

PATIENT X664
Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah I'm taking it every day.  Yeah with what they gave me I mean I've been doing it every day, taking everything.  I mean I've been feeling better but I'm still in pain, you know @@@.

DOCTOR X664
Okay.

PATIENT X664
And my head feels, but it feels like @@@ cause every time I try to move it I get, it takes time to get to the same place you know.

DOCTOR X664
Now have you ever been on any um like the more so basically you're on a fancy version of sulfa urea which are medicines that help bring down blood sugar.  Have you ever been on like glyburide or glipizide before?  So I think I might just have you try one of those instead cause it's cheaper though okay.

PATIENT X664
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR X664
So the main side effect of any medicine is it's gonna lower your blood sugars.  It could make the blood sugars go too low so if you find yourself getting woozy.

PATIENT X664
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

DOCTOR X664
Dizzy, stop taking and we'll just have you come in.  And it looks like you have hepatitis C.

PATIENT X664
Yeah.

DOCTOR X664
How long has that been the case for?

PATIENT X664
And this was something new too.

DOCTOR X664
Have you ever had any complications as far as you can tell?  

PATIENT X664
@@@ no.

DOCTOR X664
Have you ever seen a liver specialist?

PATIENT X664
No, no.  But that was one of the reasons I didn't want to take that Tylenol.

DOCTOR X664
Oh that makes sense yeah.

PATIENT X664
Yeah I mean @@@ yeah.  I read up on that stuff and everything and you know I, even I have friends that had cancer, he died you know so he gave me like six tablets of morphine because I was having so much pain.

DOCTOR X664
Oh.

PATIENT X664
So that's how I hurt my back and then I hurt my back again you know so I @@@ and I got a disk that doesn't want to @@@.  You know I tried everything you know.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah.

PATIENT X664
So I went through the drinking route and that made me sicker.  I said you know screw everything.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah.

PATIENT X664
But what she's putting in I've been doing pretty good.

DOCTOR X664
Okay and so I'll put in for that and then the request for Actos.  I will put in the request for the Cymbalta but the worse that'll happen is that they'll say no.

PATIENT X664
Yeah.

DOCTOR X664
You're going to get in to see the @@@ so I'll put everything in just so they know, that's fine uh so Cymbalta 60 mg and now.

PATIENT X664
Oh um.

DOCTOR X664
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X664
I've been having, for the past year, I think two years I've been having like a tickle in my throat and I've been coughing a lot within the past year and it's getting worse and worse.  I worked with asbestos for about 18 years.

DOCTOR X664
Hmm.

PATIENT X664
And like @@@ I don't smoke cigarettes you know and I don't know where this cough is coming from.

DOCTOR X664
How long has it been there for?

PATIENT X664
It's been getting real bad within the past couple months I mean like uh, hard time breathing, I have a gravely voice.

DOCTOR X664
Oh.

PATIENT X664
Coughing you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT X664
@@@ in my throat.

DOCTOR X664
Okay we'll do some checking on that today so dry cough and how many months would you say this has been going on for?

PATIENT X664
Uh a good four months I would say.  It's been getting worse and worse to the point now I'm coughing day and night you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X664
Is there anything specific that's triggering this cough?

PATIENT X664
No.

DOCTOR X664
@@@.

PATIENT X664
No, I mean it just seems like it's this dry cough, sometimes it's in the middle of the night, during the day.

DOCTOR X664
@@@.

PATIENT X664
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X664
Okay.

PATIENT X664
That's causing me to get up four or five times a night just to cough you know what I mean.  I @@@.

DOCTOR X664
Any problems with um acid reflux or heartburn?

PATIENT X664
Not, you know what that was the first thing I took, Zantac.

DOCTOR X664
Oh Zantac yeah.

PATIENT X664
I took that, that seemed to help a little bit but no it still stayed there.

DOCTOR X664
Uh no history of reflux.

PATIENT X664
Oh no I had that.

DOCTOR X664
Okay.

PATIENT X664
It didn't really @@@ but I haven't had that for 20-30 years.

DOCTOR X664
Okay tried taking Zantac but cough is not improved.  And any issues with seasonal allergies?

PATIENT X664
No, none of that.

DOCTOR X664
Okay.  Or feeling like a kind of a postnasal drip down the back of your throat?

PATIENT X664
No.

DOCTOR X664
Okay.

PATIENT X664
That's the only reason I'm @@@.

DOCTOR X664
Okay well one thing you are on lisinopril and all medications in that class can cause people to cough so we could try switching the lisinopril to another medication that works similarly that is less likely to cause a cough.

PATIENT X664
But you see the thing is I was taking the lisinopril before and then the cough.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah but people can get it even then.  Oh no we're still gonna check out @@@ certainly uh.

PATIENT X664
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR X664
So we can and that's for cough.

PATIENT X664
It might be, it's @@@.

DOCTOR X664
Okay.  The gravely voice also uh is a little bit.

PATIENT X664
It's a tickle.  It @@@, it's kind of up here then it's down here.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah.  We'll get a chest x-ray to see what's going on uh.  @@@ we'll get that done today so we'll see if anything is super obvious then we can make a decision about right away and then okay.  So we talked about your cough and them um diabetes how's that going?

PATIENT X664
That seems like it's going okay.  You know I mean, I'm not really high, I've been in maybe @@@ 180s, 210s, something like that you know @@@.

DOCTOR X664
What about first thing in the morning when you test it?

PATIENT X664
Yeah, yeah in the morning you know it'll be 160, 180 you know.  Then you know after I eat and take the pills, you know it'll go up some more or something, then it'll come down some more.  Like I kept it @@@.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah.

PATIENT X664
You know cause when I eat it stays between 180 and like 220 yeah.

DOCTOR X664
Okay cause it looks like looking at your labs we got an A1c which was are all of your blood sugars you know the previous three months and your numbers on your labs were good.  So whatever you've been doing.

PATIENT X664
Okay.

DOCTOR X664
Between July and April it was right, @@@.

PATIENT X664
Okay.

DOCTOR X664
Uh and then your cholesterol looks good.  Your on the meds for cholesterol so we'll keep that going and then let's see for the hep C we've gotta get you some labs uh, just particularly for the hep C every year we like to check the marker for liver cancer, it's just a blood test and we'll get an ultrasound of your liver to make sure that everything looks okay.

PATIENT X664
Okay.

DOCTOR X664
So you can probably get these done today um and you're liver function tests were pretty good so.  Yeah we usually check that once a year just to make sure everything looks good so we'll get that put in.  So @@@ get this done today and then we can forward the  ultrasound that they will contact you about.  They know we're gonna see you on that.  @@@ lab we can get that sent to @@@.

Have you tried taking anything for them that helps?

PATIENT X664

Well like yeah I just thought of @@@.

DOCTOR X664
Yeah.

PATIENT X664
But yeah maybe, maybe it doesn't happen so.

DOCTOR X664
So why don't we try cause maybe it's just stress.  You know maybe it's like some sort of a @@@ muscle spasm going on in your shoulder here.  It could be something @@@ you should be able to take some anti-inflammatories and we'll see if that doe the trick.  So let me put in for that.  Let me do a quick look and I feel like here there's some kind of a @@@ tip of the iceberg @@@ order for you so um @@@ we'll have you come back in not too long uh to make sure everything is kind of on the right step.

DOCTOR X533
PATIENT.

PATIENT X533 
Yo.

DOCTOR X533
How's it going today?

PATIENT X533
Hi.  Good afternoon, hi.  So that's who I am.

DOCTOR X533
Alright I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT X533
DOCTOR.  Um this is the correct list?

DOCTOR X533
I don't think I have you on here.

PATIENT X533
Okay I mean how can I get in contact if I like you again for the next time?

DOCTOR X533
Um let's see what I can find.

PATIENT X533
Okay.

DOCTOR X533
Uh. 

PATIENT X533
I think they messed up on the medications last time so we need to double check it.

DOCTOR X533
Okay.  @@@.  @@@.  It looks like the last time when you came in DOCTOR saw you because of the, first off in general if you come back to the Blue Clinic on Tuesday afternoons it'll be me from now on okay.

PATIENT X533
Yeah but if don't come back on Tuesday I can request you right?

DOCTOR X533
Uh.  

PATIENT X533
I couldn't remember 90 days who you are.

DOCTOR X533
I mean yeah exactly.  It would be nice if I had kind of a normal day, given out @@@ you don't have to get refills @@@.

PATIENT X533
There's nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that at all isn't it?

DOCTOR X533
But uh, no so the last clinic @@@ all residents from UIC here, my clinic is just Tuesday afternoons but if Tuesday afternoons work for you and that's when you can come in.

PATIENT X533
@@@ that right you know then I can say DOCTOR on Tuesday.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly.

PATIENT X533
Okay uh you know I'd like to have an appointment on Tuesday.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
So they'll give me a time we're getting along okay.  We're starting a doctor and patient relationship, other than seeing somebody different every time you come in.

DOCTOR X533
Good.

PATIENT X533
It's kind of like tough.  It's like going to a shoe store and you know the shoes that you like and you know that they fit good but then you go to another shoe store and they don't have them, so what do I do, oh you go back to the original one.  Just uh alright.

DOCTOR X533
Alright so how have you been sir?  

PATIENT X533
Feeling pretty good uh.  Been a little bit more active so because of the heat and that I've been kind of keeping it low key, doing uh bicycle riding, doing some walking, doing the flea markets, doing the garage sales okay and keeping myself active.  You know I'm unemployed right now and uh basically I think uh keeping myself in motion.  Coming here today though got me a little, my blood pressure's a little bit high because of the questions they asked me.  I had to go to the people down the hallway here and they asked me questions that I didn't expect them to ask, no they asked but then I came here and they asked the same questions again but uh and they needed to know just basically if you have a will, who they would contact and all that and you know to me that doesn't add up.  I only have to have one person once I leave here.

DOCTOR X533
Correct.

PATIENT X533
Okay.  I'm just wondering whether @@@ okay but otherwise everything else @@@ for some reason here, it's a very important factor.

DOCTOR X533
Okay.

PATIENT X533
Because they don't know what to do with me after I'm gone.

DOCTOR X533
Well it's not that, it's not just that.  I mean there's more before you do that uh.  I think one of the big things is we want to know if something were to happen what you would want and not at the end but before that.

PATIENT X533
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X533
Uh.

PATIENT X533
I see what the technicality is.

DOCTOR X533
It's nothing, I mean some patients want everything done.  They want, no matter what, they would rather be alive on a ventilator than not um and so it's not a decision you have to make right this second.

PATIENT X533
Right.

DOCTOR X533
It's nothing that's urgent um.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
You're a very healthy 61-year-old that just.

PATIENT X533
62, it's actually 2, next month.

DOCTOR X533
Next month yeah so a little of the high blood pressure that's been controlled.  A little bit of diabetes that you've been doing good.  There's no obvious problems that the diabetes has caused for you.  That's been pretty well controlled.  Uh so there's nothing that, we're not saying this because we're looking here and we're going oh man we better the directive soon because.

PATIENT X533
Asked twice in one day, I'm kind of like you know.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
But then once again I'm gonna consider what they had to say to me today.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly.

PATIENT X533
Now I might have to have another decision or make another decision next time I come in.

DOCTOR X533
Good.

PATIENT X533
But then once again I just wasn't prepared for all that.

DOCTOR X533
Right and it's just one of those things that we just have to open up that topic at some point.

PATIENT X533
Yeah so.

DOCTOR X533
Twice on the same day.

PATIENT X533
You know I hope not.  I hope we can resolve.

DOCTOR X533
But uh so yeah it's just something to keep in mind.  It's not anything.  We didn't pick you out of the crowd and.

PATIENT X533
I know that.  I know, I know, I know.

DOCTOR X533
@@@.  But uh but so since March you've been feeling pretty well.

PATIENT X533
Yeah, no problems.  Every thing’s booking along.

DOCTOR X533
Good.

PATIENT X533
And basically, hoping to find a job and.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
I've been very active on that.

DOCTOR X533
Good.

PATIENT X533
I've been actually been going out and contacting @@@.  You know what the problem is, is the people who've been very responsive with their thinking and being responsible for who they are and the thing is when you get a reply back no you're not qualified, we, you're specifically gonna keep you in mind, okay you're getting some type of response.  It's the ones that I send out.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Did it get lost in cyberspace?

DOCTOR X533
Right, you don't know yeah.

PATIENT X533
I mean.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah it's like.

PATIENT X533
Yeah or.

DOCTOR X533
Either that or did it just, was there just some mix-up and you need to send it again or yeah.

PATIENT X533
Like this is the reason why too in relationships between doctors and patients should always be on a regular basis.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Because then this way here you feel comfortable, you know where you're going, you know what to expect.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly.

PATIENT X533
Uh seeing only once before, like you said and uh okay I know who you are but I've forgotten how you work.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly.

PATIENT X533
Cause it's been six months.

DOCTOR X533
Yep.

PATIENT X533
Okay and the thing is that now that I'm beginning to have a little bit deeper understanding about you and I feel pretty comfortable and I'm kind of relaxed now, we can concentrate on who you are okay, alright.  So um the medication that's in question.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
Is this one.  Okay.

DOCTOR X533
Okay.

PATIENT X533
I found when I took one of these big ones that I take twice a day right.  Okay I should take two of these too every time I take one, so that's four a day.

DOCTOR X533
Take two of them by mouth every morning; let's see if that's what it says uh.

PATIENT X533
But that's what written out but the last time.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
I mean let's go back farther in our record and take a look at that and how many there were before.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
It should be, it should be 360 for 90 days.

DOCTOR X533
Correct.

PATIENT X533
Or 120 for a month.

DOCTOR X533
No yeah so you've usually been taking um one in the morning and one at night or two in the morning and two at night?

PATIENT X533
Two in the morning and two at night because I take two every time I take one of these big boys.

DOCTOR X533
Okay.

PATIENT X533
And that's for the.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah it's your doctors just like the old notes and that.

PATIENT X533
I mean.

DOCTOR X533
Let's see if that's twice a day, yeah you've had it twice a day.

PATIENT X533
Yeah, two tablets twice a day, that's four.  So I take two in the morning, two at night when I take the big boy 2000 mg, the horse pills.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah that's kind of a fat pill.  Uh you weren't having any episodes of low blood sugars right?

PATIENT X533
Uh sometimes if I don't eat right on time.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
Or you know what I mean, I might go for maybe an hour, hour and a half.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Then it does go down quite a bit.  It goes down to about 70 but then once you get, I mean I never, I'm always, you feel it you know.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
You get busy, you know then you sit there and say wait a minute; we got to do something now, now okay.  So uh just basically yeah but then that's because I'm not paying attention to my daily procedure.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly.

PATIENT X533
Okay.

DOCTOR X533
Okay, so that's the only thing I'd be concerned if you're having those low blood sugars that maybe they went down to the lower dose but you know we can get, it should be two pills twice a day like you've always taken.

PATIENT X533
Yeah, yeah okay.

DOCTOR X533
And there's no reason to change it because like I said everything has been going well.

PATIENT X533
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X533
Uh so I'll refill that and I'll send you that too out.

PATIENT X533
And I had my teeth examined and everything since the last time I was here and uh we had another little problem but they looked into it pretty deeply the last time I was here and we found out it's really not a problem.

DOCTOR X533
What was that?

PATIENT X533
That was the uh.

DOCTOR X533
The @@@?

PATIENT X533
Yeah and the one where I was having problems with @@@ drip from okay and for some reason uh it all got back to the idea of how much coffee I drink.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Okay and kind of like okay.

DOCTOR X533
Sometimes they over think things.

PATIENT X533
Right, right, you know and I'm kind of like okay.  I cut down on coffee, guess what, no more problems.  No more @@@ drip.  So it took a little bit and we had to drink a lot of water and we put the pressure tester and all that other stuff and as far as they were concerned everything looked good and he focused in on the coffee.

DOCTOR X533
Good.  Oh yeah, easy fix then.

PATIENT X533
Yes it was.

DOCTOR X533
That's always nice.

PATIENT X533
Well even when it happens, first of all it's embarrassing.  Second of all you smell like that for the rest of the day.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Okay and the is you know you got to find out what's really going on.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X533
Okay and sure enough, so all I want is the medication, now we have it all set right?

DOCTOR X533
Yeah um the refill on all of those yeah.

PATIENT X533
Yeah well you know and the thing is since I'm doing so well, will you write a refill?

DOCTOR X533
Yeah, yeah, we'll get it refilled now.  Yeah um.

PATIENT X533
One time and then this way here I'll come back in so I'll leave this six month.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
Period where I won't have to come in okay.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
And then I will come in and most likely we'll probably take another blood test and the whole deal, you know.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah that makes sense it's uh.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
Go in the Lab.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
Okay so let's see what your cholesterol and see when it was done, September so yeah we don't have to check it until next time.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah that'll be fine.  We just check it every one to two years but generally we'll check it every year since you're on a cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT X533
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X533
Um to make sure it's continuing to work but otherwise.

PATIENT X533
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X533
Everything else looks good.  Your blood pressure, I think you've got it a little bit elevated but that could be stress, that could be something else.

PATIENT X533
Well, yeah I told you what I, you know cause normally I don't get to answer these questions and uh well, see here, I got @@@ so anyway.  Nice person.  Interesting, it's nice for her to @@@.

DOCTOR X533
What can I say though, oh, alright.  So you'd like these all sent to you or do you want to pick them up today.

PATIENT X533
Uh I think we can have them sent to me and that'd be at my @@@ address which is ADDRESS.  Cause I can't send it to my house you know why don't you?  They get picked up.

DOCTOR X533
Alright.

PATIENT X533
Yeah, it's what I have to do.  This is where I want it sent to.

DOCTOR X533
To the temporary one, yeah.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.  Because if they send it to the house, believe it or not this guy's probably the mailman.  Yeah and there's nothing you can do about it as long as you can stay within uh 50 feet, they come @@@.

DOCTOR X533
Hmm.

PATIENT X533
It's in my handbook.

DOCTOR X533
That's a little scary.

PATIENT X533
So the thing is I send it to this guy and it's not a problem.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
He's my auto mechanic so; he's a pretty decent guy.

DOCTOR X533
Glyburide uh.  

PATIENT X533
Yeah and uh will it cost me anything for another pill cutter?  Okay, let's try to get another one of those, yeah.  That's another thing cutting pills in half but I guess that saved a lot of money.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah and that's what we do here like in my other clinic over at the University of Illinois we rarely do that.  It's always like if you're going from 10 to 20 or from 20 to 10 you don't cut the 20s in half you just give them 10 mg so but here yeah it saves them money.

PATIENT X533
I can understand it saves almost a million.

DOCTOR X533
Really.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
I know it's a lot because there are very few medicines that we don't have people split up.  Have a seat up here.

PATIENT X533
Alright okay.

DOCTOR X533
I'll have you take deep breaths in and out.  Okay and lay back.

PATIENT X533
Okay.

DOCTOR X533
And uh, so no fevers, chills, chest pain, belly pain?

PATIENT X533
No, no.

DOCTOR X533
Nothing like that.

PATIENT X533
Nothing like that at all.

DOCTOR X533
No swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X533
No.  Everything else is fine.

DOCTOR X533
Good.

PATIENT X533
Anatomy stuff.

DOCTOR X533
Good okay.

PATIENT X533
No the reason why I had the feet cut checked out, I guess they wanted sensitivity cause I was growing a big callus.

DOCTOR X533
Okay.

PATIENT X533
And the problem was is that I couldn't feel anything, you understand on that side of the foot and he gave me a pair of inserts to put in and it made a big difference.

DOCTOR X533
It did?  Good.

PATIENT X533
Yep.  That callus went away and I got full complete feeling back on that side.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Yeah it's just a matter of you know tidying and tuning.

DOCTOR X533
They fixed it yeah.

PATIENT X533
Yeah somehow they fit and they.

DOCTOR X533
You corrected it.

PATIENT X533
Yeah and the thing is @@@ right off so the shoes.  I'd say that's another thing, stay away from the coffee, don't buy cheap shoes.  Okay.

DOCTOR X533
@@@.

PATIENT X533
No.  I'm on a tight budget, oh yeah you know being unemployed it's kind of hard.  Tell you what I had these made um online okay and I want you to go over there and it's made by @@@ or something like that.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
And you get 500 for 15, its ten dollars to have them made and five bucks to have them shipped and you get them the next day.

DOCTOR X533
Really.

PATIENT X533
Yep for 500.

DOCTOR X533
You put on the.

PATIENT X533
Yeah, all that, keep it.

DOCTOR X533
@@@.

PATIENT X533
This one year and I haven't done that, what's that place where they sell packing paper and all that other stuff, that was $29.95 for 350.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
That was a little too high and I like this, these come out good but then once again go on the internet and they can do everything.

DOCTOR X533
Oh everything.

PATIENT X533
Yeah what's that, Vista yeah I think it was Vista.  You see them advertised on TV okay and they make 500 cards for ten bucks okay and this is how it comes.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah alright.  I have some at home, I just have to bring them @@@.

PATIENT X533
Oh could be.

DOCTOR X533
I keep forgetting to bring them.

PATIENT X533
Sounds good, @@@.  I mean.

DOCTOR X533
We'll see, @@@.

PATIENT X533
No I mean being a doctor you know.

DOCTOR X533
Right yeah.  So let me talk with.

PATIENT X533
Okay.

DOCTOR X533
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X533
Sure.

DOCTOR X533
He's my attending right now and we'll get you out of here in just a bit.

PATIENT X533
Okay, alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  52:55  DOCTOR IN:  73:43)

DOCTOR X533
Alright, sorry about that.

PATIENT X533
Alright no problem, I understand he's probably pretty busy too.  I want you to print your name on here too before you leave.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Are we gonna double check our quantities again?

DOCTOR X533
Yeah I'll just run it through one more time.

PATIENT X533
Okay.

DOCTOR X533
And see you back here in six months.

PATIENT X533
Okay.  Oh you're gonna do that okay.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X533
Come up again okay.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
Do you like that Vista; yeah I think its xxx xxx or Vista Pal.  You'll find it on the internet.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533
Print your business card for ten bucks.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah.

PATIENT X533
And it's really good you can do everything on the computer.  So we're gonna check the quantities of these again and.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah I'll just make sure @@@.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
I gave you one refill on everything so I'm gonna give you a 90 day supply and one refill so.

PATIENT X533
Yeah, alright, give me six months.

DOCTOR X533
I'll see you back in six months.

PATIENT X533
Right.

DOCTOR X533
Uh otherwise we'll not need any blood work or anything till then.

PATIENT X533
Okay.  Now the thing is when I go for a refill I just call it in?

DOCTOR X533
Yep.

PATIENT X533
Just call it in.

DOCTOR X533
Uh yeah as far as I know, I don't know.

PATIENT X533
I don't know the procedure here that I kind of like, they told me they have a new procedure here going.

DOCTOR X533
Really.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
Alright, yeah I'm not sure besides calling it in to get refills I'm not sure.  If you need, like there's no refills available and you need them you can always talk with them and I don't know if you have the clinic number.

PATIENT X533
Yeah I got the clinic number.  I got that yeah.

DOCTOR X533
And um they can just let them know my name and they can get a hold of me and I can put in for a refill.

PATIENT X533
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X533
Like if you need them.

PATIENT X533
See.

DOCTOR X533
Just say something got stolen and.

PATIENT X533
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR X533
In the mail uh we can always just put them in again and send them to the right place.

PATIENT X533
Now you know @@@.  See once again I didn't know that.  The only thing I had to do is.

DOCTOR X533
I mean now that.

PATIENT X533
Drop your name you know.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly, now that you're in the clinic I mean we've been seeing each other, I mean this is only your second time but you're in my clinic and as long as you want me to be I'm going to be your primary doctor.

PATIENT X533
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X533
So we don't have to go through all the rig-a-ma-roll if um just something happens with your meds.

PATIENT X533
Well that's important.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah these aren’t medications that I'm concerned that you're abusing or anything like that.

PATIENT X533
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR X533
It's something that, whatever if you lose them.

PATIENT X533
Right well I've got some; I need the diabetic ones for sure.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly and they can get a hold of me or get a hold of the nurse and they can get a hold of me.

PATIENT X533
Okay.

DOCTOR X533
And we can get it all taken care of.  Alright.

PATIENT X533
Alright.

DOCTOR X533
Everything else looks good though.  We'll see you back here in about six months.

PATIENT X533
Okay.

DOCTOR X533
And recheck everything.

PATIENT X533
Excellent.  Very good sir.

DOCTOR X533
Good to see you.

PATIENT X533
Excellent.  Well it feels good that we had this little talk and we're getting to know each other even better and now I know a little bit more about the procedure.

DOCTOR X533
Exactly.

PATIENT X533
And uh the only thing I have to really make sure is before I leave here is talk to somebody about the refill and make sure I follow the directions.

DOCTOR X533
Yeah, I don't know who would be good.  I mean you can try to get in touch, I mean you can go talk to the Pharmacy people.  Tell them I know.

PATIENT X533
Yeah.

DOCTOR X533
Do you know her?

PATIENT X533
No I don't know her.

DOCTOR X533
She could help you with it.

PATIENT X533
Talking with the Pharmacy people right now is like whoa, you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X533
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X533

Doctor talks with another person regarding prescriptions)

DOCTOR X300  
Hello PATIENT.

PATIENT X300
Hello.  

DOCTOR X300
How are things going?

PATIENT X300
Fine.

DOCTOR X300
Fine okay.  Well my name is DOCTOR.

PATIENT X300
Hi.

DOCTOR X300
Uh I'm going to be your primary care physician and I was just, I think I was expecting you in July but you didn't come.

PATIENT X300
Yeah I totally forgot the appointment.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah and then uh, it looks like you had @@@ scheduled @@@.

PATIENT X300
Oh, I have, that's all scheduled.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay, alright so all I have here for PATIENT uh, it looks like the main issue right now is high cholesterol and you had a surgery of uh your ankle.

PATIENT X300
Yep.

DOCTOR X300
Left ankle and then I think that's about it of what we have in the chart so far.  You don't have much issues going on?  Okay and then you come here for yearly check-ups.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
How's your ankle doing?

PATIENT X300
It's doing fine.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.

PATIENT X300
Uh there's nothing.

DOCTOR X300
Why did you get a surgery for it, do you know?

PATIENT X300
Yeah um I basically broke my ankle back in '88.

DOCTOR X300
Oh in 1988 and you had surgery for how many different times?

PATIENT X300
@@@.

DOCTOR X300
@@@ when was the last time?

PATIENT X300
January 31st in 2011.

DOCTOR X300
Okay and uh and your feeling is it's not getting any better?

PATIENT X300
@@@.

DOCTOR X300
Uh do you take any pain medication for that?

PATIENT X300
Oh I was on Vicodin and I had, but it was only if I need it and I ran out.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.

PATIENT X300
And I just never came back for it.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  Um but you're doing fine without that or do you want more?

PATIENT X300
There's some days I'd like to have.

DOCTOR X300
Like to have.  Vicodin is a little stronger, have you tried Norco?

PATIENT X300
That's all they gave me was.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.

PATIENT X300
Two 60 prescriptions of 30.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.  Oh lets try Norco then because you were taking too much Vicodin alright?

PATIENT X300
Well just when I really.

DOCTOR X300
Just when you really need it.

PATIENT X300
When I really need it.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah.

PATIENT X300
I just take one or two for a day or so, because with me driving a truck I can't, you know I can't one now and then go drive.

DOCTOR X300
Right.

PATIENT X300
Cause you know it puts you to sleep.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah have you tried Norco or no?

PATIENT X300
Oh I know what it is.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.  Maybe we can try that.  Uh and the Naproxen you take that pain medication too?

PATIENT X300
I'm out of that.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay and then you take this two times a day?

PATIENT X300
Um pretty much.

DOCTOR X300
Or only when you need this?

PATIENT X300
I didn't even realize it was expired.

DOCTOR X300
Oh so you don't even use it then?

PATIENT X300
Well I use it but it's just as I need it.

DOCTOR X300
As you need it okay.  That's a good way to use, so you don't have to schedule this um, it's just use it like you're using right now because there's always risks in these medications and you know it makes you dizzy, the Vicodin makes you dizzy and Norco can hurt your kidneys so it's better if you don’t need it, don't take it okay um.

PATIENT X300
So what's the cholesterol at?

DOCTOR X300
Let's see cholesterol, you had it today right?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
I haven't looked at it yet.  I was going to see what's new going on.

PATIENT X300
@@@.

DOCTOR X300
@@@ so let's see 136.

PATIENT X300
Is that high?

DOCTOR X300
So let's see, so what you have your age is, how old are you?

PATIENT X300
48.

DOCTOR X300
48 so you're young and um 136 @@@.  You don't have hypertension right?

PATIENT X300
No.

DOCTOR X300
So 136 is not too bad actually.  Um I think for your goal it should be um so you're 48 and uh, do you smoke?

PATIENT X300
No.

DOCTOR X300
Ever?

PATIENT X300
No.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  So since you haven't smoke, your goal would be 160 for the LDL.

PATIENT X300
So I'm under.

DOCTOR X300
You're under yep so this will be fine for that.

PATIENT X300
So I just cut the breads out and starches and I be alright.

DOCTOR X300
What?

PATIENT X300
So I just cut the potatoes out.

DOCTOR X300
Wait a minute, so it's your diet you're watching now right?

PATIENT X300
I'm trying.

DOCTOR X300
It's not the breads actually.

PATIENT X300
Oh.

DOCTOR X300
It's the um like uh red meat, uh cholesterol, what else do eat, hamburgers?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.  We eat red meat.

DOCTOR X300
If you eat meat, there's a lot of cholesterol um, what else, what else, cheese, butter that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Those are high in cholesterol I'd say.  Um otherwise if you basically if you eat like a healthy diet and you take out the @@@ okay, vegetables, fruits, that's kind of stuff.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Lower cholesterol so I want you to eat those kinds of stuff.  Um so you're watching your diet?

PATIENT X300
Yes.

DOCTOR X300
That's good and uh you're a exercising?

PATIENT X300
Not as much as I should but.

DOCTOR X300
Not as much as you should okay.

PATIENT X300
No.

DOCTOR X300
So you know it's hard when you have a job and all.  I can't exercise either so.

PATIENT X300
Well my job is just @@@ you never know when you're gonna work so it's just like now.

DOCTOR X300
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X300
They could call me and I'd have to be at work in two hours.

DOCTOR X300
Oh really.

PATIENT X300
I don't have a set schedule.

DOCTOR X300
You're like on call all the time?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
That's tough.

PATIENT X300
Yeah so.

DOCTOR X300
And do they call you at night too?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.  They call me any time of the day every half hour, @@@.

DOCTOR X300
How long do you have to work after that?

PATIENT X300
14.

DOCTOR X300
When you don't get a call do you work @@@?

PATIENT X300
Up to 14 hours and then we'll get 10 hours off and then they call you again.

DOCTOR X300
Oh so you don't, you can't predict when you're working the next time?

PATIENT X300
Nope.

DOCTOR X300
Wow, that's a tough job.

PATIENT X300
Then after we do six days we get 2 1/2 days off.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  So that's on that cycle where you get six days and 2 1/2 days off.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.  Cause like right now, this week here, is where we got messed up because I got robbed on Sunday, I tried to replace all my cards, I went to work for one day and then I didn't want to miss this so I took a sick day so it'll be next weekend before I get off again.

DOCTOR X300

PATIENT X300

DOCTOR X300
Oh thank you so much for coming.

PATIENT X300
So.

DOCTOR X300
I see.  Soyou're, so you don't have like a protected weekend, it depends on the schedule?

PATIENT X300
It just depends on my schedule.  I try to get the weekend but a lot of times it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Thursday, Friday.

DOCTOR X300
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X300
You know.

DOCTOR X300
Okay and then you have, recently you had a sleep study done here.

PATIENT X300

DOCTOR X300
And then you have the CPAP and you're using that right now?

PATIENT X300

DOCTOR X300
Do you sleep better with that?

PATIENT X300

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  Okay.  Um so for today, so I didn't see any shots given to you uh in the computer.

DOCTOR X300

DOCTOR X300

PATIENT X300
I don't know I just don't.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  You don't think that it's worth it?

PATIENT X300
No.

DOCTOR X300
It's free.

PATIENT X300
I know I just you know.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  I come from other country and in my country you have to pay $100 for.

PATIENT X300
Where?

DOCTOR X300
I come from Japan.

PATIENT X300
I lived in xxx and Hokkaido.

DOCTOR X300
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X300
I got lost in xxx for a day.

DOCTOR X300
Oh really.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah then we have the American base there @@@.

PATIENT X300
Uh we did the walk up xxx.

DOCTOR X300
Oh you did that, oh that's good, I want to go do that.

PATIENT X300
Did you do that?

DOCTOR X300
Oh no, no, no I can't do that.

PATIENT X300
I got my walking stick at home so.

DOCTOR X300
Did you go up into the @@@?

PATIENT X300
Yeah we were in the Marines, so they got a little base there.

DOCTOR X300
Oh.

PATIENT X300
@@@.

DOCTOR X300
So it's a part of your @@@?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Wow.

PATIENT X300
What part of Japan are you from?

DOCTOR X300
Uh I'm from uh @@@ in north central, in north central uh.

PATIENT X300
@@@

DOCTOR X300
@@@.

PATIENT X300
@@@ parking garage where the cars go like this.

DOCTOR X300
Oh yeah, that's all the time, that's all the time.

PATIENT X300
Well it's the first you know.

DOCTOR X300
Because you know you have land here and we have very limited land so we have to yeah.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
And then the way we park, even if you don't have @@@ we have the cars like, our car you have to park like this you know so you have to, cause space is very limited so you can't park like this if the wall is here, you have to park like this all the time.

PATIENT X300
Oh I mean yeah, xxx when I was there, other than they didn't have no room to park.

DOCTOR X300
Right, right, so that's how it is okay.  So and the other uh shot I can give you is something called Tdap, this is something to prevent tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria.

PATIENT X300
I just had a tetanus shot.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah I know you had that in 2006.

PATIENT X300
No I had it in 2008, I stepped on a nail.

DOCTOR X300
You stepped on a nail okay.

PATIENT X300
Cause I couldn't remember if I had one.

DOCTOR X300
Uh so in 2008 I think you got a tetanus shot um because you stepped on a nail.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Um this one has tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, which is whooping cough.  Um sometimes you know uh it's not so popular right now but once you get it it's you have to cough a lot, you're uncomfortable, so if you can prevent it with a shot, I think you can just get a shot, so everybody below 65 we kind of have to recommend that to you so if you're interested we can give it to you.

PATIENT X300
Oh I'll get it next time.

DOCTOR X300
Next time okay.

PATIENT X300
Yeah. So what's up with the @@@?  Because my friend's got kind of like a cough like all the time, he just coughs.

DOCTOR X300
Uh I mean that's very common so I can't really tell.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
A small cough, I would say it's probably just like asthma or it probably came from a.

PATIENT X300
He smokes too so.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah smoking obviously can cause that.

PATIENT X300
We watched the movie @@@.

DOCTOR X300
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X300
Have you seen that yet?

DOCTOR X300
Invasion?

PATIENT X300
About the spread of a virus.

DOCTOR X300
Oh I haven't seen that yet.

PATIENT X300
Oh we watched it last night and then everybody in the movie who started to get sick had that little (cough, cough) and she's like oh my God I got a cold.

DOCTOR X300
Oh.

PATIENT X300
@@@.

DOCTOR X300
That's a bad influence.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Oh.

PATIENT X300
It's kind of just like, did you ever seen the movie Outbreak?

DOCTOR X300
Uh actually no, so yeah.

PATIENT X300
It's about the Ebola.

DOCTOR X300
Ebola oh I see.

PATIENT X300
You know how that spreads and everything and.

DOCTOR X300
Wow.  Okay I need to discuss about an Advanced Directive.

PATIENT X300
Who?

DOCTOR X300
Advanced Directives like um something like Power of Attorney.

PATIENT X300
I have that.

DOCTOR X300
You do have that?

PATIENT X300
Yeah at home yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.

PATIENT X300
Well I have a no resuscitate.

DOCTOR X300
Oh you have no resuscitate, you want to do a Do Not Resuscitate?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
And why is that?

PATIENT X300
Uh I watched my mom and dad die and they kept trying and trying and trying and was nothing and.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.  Okay so if you can read this um and then you can call the number.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
And give the physical papers here so that everybody would know, they'll put it in your chart and uh.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Then everyone will know that.  So the last time uh you had a fall before?

PATIENT X300
Yeah it was from my left ankle.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.  Did you just get @@@ in there?

PATIENT X300
Well, just when I step on it the ankle comes up towards me.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.

PATIENT X300
And it gives out for a second and I just fall over.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.  Do you take any medication other than from the VA?

PATIENT X300
Aspirin.

DOCTOR X300
Aspirin, baby aspirin 81 mg or is it for the pain?

PATIENT X300
It's just uh.

DOCTOR X300
Do you know why you take aspirin?

PATIENT X300
Yeah it's just for the pain; I took it when I ran out of.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.

PATIENT X300
Either Advil or Tylenol.

DOCTOR X300
Advil, Tylenol, okay.  And you don't want @@@ right?

PATIENT X300
@@@, sleep last night.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  So and your blood pressure looks okay.  Any symptoms coming on?

PATIENT X300
No.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  @@@ cold.  How's your weight?

PATIENT X300
I'm heavy.

DOCTOR X300
You're heavy.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Oh but you were losing weight the time before, last year it was 230 and now it's 210.  So that's good.

PATIENT X300
It could be better.

DOCTOR X300
It could be better.  So losing weight is always better with other things.  Because it can prevent a lot of things um, maybe you've heard about diabetes, um hypertension.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
And those things, once you start having it, progresses and uh it lasts @@@ taken to the hospital but those @@@ going to be miserable and the hypertension and diabetes progress so you know it's better to steer people away from that from the first step so that you know you don't have to worry about that @@@ on your life.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
So now you're fairly young so you're not worrying too much about that but it's always good to keep your lifestyle in good shape as far as weight, diet, exercise, those things so I would recommend that.  Um and then uh so finally can I see your feet and listen to your heart?

PATIENT X300
Sure.  You want the shoes off or?

DOCTOR X300
Yeah can you take your shoes off?

PATIENT X300
Both or just one?

DOCTOR X300
Um just your shoes and socks would be fine @@@.  Do you want to pick up your medications today or?

PATIENT X300
No they can mail them.

DOCTOR X300
Can mail it okay.  So I'll give you something called Norco if you don't mind and uh every four hour tab with it @@@.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
And we @@@ do that one and 90 day supply of those.  Probably if you had 120 pills, it will last for 90 days right?

PATIENT X300
Yeah we should go longer probably.

DOCTOR X300
Longer yeah and @@@ here.

PATIENT X300
What it is like, is it like Vicodin or what?

DOCTOR X300
It's generally the same.  The same thing is in it um something called um, has a narcotic, older than narcotic and a combination of acetaminophen @@@.  It's a painkiller you usually take when you have pain or something.  It can help improve pain, so Vicodin is also a combination but the narcotics they're using is slightly different so Vicodin is a little stronger than the Norco.  But I was thinking it you've never tried Norco before right?

PATIENT X300
No, so it's a little less Vicodin but a little more aspirin kind of?

DOCTOR X300
Oh let's see so it's a little bit less Vicodin and aspirin @@@ pain okay.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Alright so I'll give you that.

PATIENT X300
It's always good when you have less.

DOCTOR X300
Okay, yeah.

PATIENT X300
You know.

DOCTOR X300
And uh we'll give you the Naproxen, how much are you taking?

PATIENT X300
Oh I don't remember.

DOCTOR X300
Uh 500 mg two times a day so I'll renew for one year as well.  So you take this only when you need it right?

PATIENT X300
That's all I take it yeah.

DOCTOR X300
So I think 120 pills will be okay and uh if you need a refill then let me know.  Okay so I'll examine you.  @@@ back?

PATIENT X300
Yes.

DOCTOR X300
Where's the pain?

PATIENT X300
Right in the @@@.

DOCTOR X300
Here?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.  Where it comes up, that's where it is.

DOCTOR X300
You  have pain here?

PATIENT X300
And up through there.

DOCTOR X300
You have a little bit of swelling here too.  Is it always like that?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Oh like you have some fluid there?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  @@@ okay you still want @@@?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Let me take a listen to your heart sir?  Deep breath for me please.  Take a deep breath, breathe out, once more, breathe out, once more.  Breathe out, once more, breathe out.  Good.  Open your eyes.  @@@.  Stick out your tongue ah.

PATIENT X300
Ah.

DOCTOR X300
Move your tongue, good.  Okay.  So I think that's about it.  So you're doing well generally.  The only recommendation from me is that you can lose a little more weight um and I know that you have irregular hours.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
So those things can cause your blood pressure to go high or get it to go high so sleep as much as possible and increase that and @@@.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
So that you'll feel refreshed.  I think it was good that you got the CPAP cause that will help you sleep better.

PATIENT X300
Oh yeah I notice a big difference using it.

DOCTOR X300
Oh okay.  So you're not interested in prostate now.

PATIENT X300
No.

DOCTOR X300
And other things you don't need cause you're still young so and I think that's it for this trip and that's all I have.

PATIENT X300
So how's the iron?

DOCTOR X300
You have water?

PATIENT X300
No how was the INR cause a couple years ago I had a little high iron.

DOCTOR X300
High iron?

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Uh I haven't checked the iron.

PATIENT X300
Well @@@.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.

PATIENT X300
The VA they had me have an ultrasound and said I might have a fatty liver but.

DOCTOR X300
You had an iron study, you had fatty liver on the ultrasound?

PATIENT X300
Well that's what they said but that's been years ago.

DOCTOR X300
Okay so I don't see an iron study for that.  We haven't done iron studies here okay.  So I can recheck that, I'll call the Lab and see if they can add on to the labs we did for you this morning uh and see if we can, if we can't add it maybe you want to check it again.

PATIENT X300
Yeah I'll come back and take it.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah whenever you come back we'll check it then. (Doctor called Lab)  Well they will have iron studies with the lab this morning so I'll check the results and let you know if there's anything going on.  I think they were worried about something called hemochromatosis @@@.

PATIENT X300
Why is that?

DOCTOR X300
I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure so I think they checked an ultrasound and they were finding your iron might be a little high.

PATIENT X300
Right.

DOCTOR X300
And that is something called hemochromatosis which is a disease that causes the iron to get stored excessively, in a normal person it's not good with getting it out so you have a high level of iron so the iron was @@@ usually goes into the liver, to the pancreas and it can change the color of the skin and people get @@@.  It's called @@@.  So your skin gets a bronze color and then @@@ completely so you don't have that as much and uh if they didn't say anything further then I'm not too worried about it.

PATIENT X300
Yeah they never said.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah so I just wanted to check it to see if anything has progressed with that and uh if there is any abnormal results I'll let you know.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  Um so I need to talk to my supervisor and then I'll come back very soon okay.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  66:28  DOCTOR IN:  71:21)

DOCTOR X300
Okay sir.  So the plan remains the same.

PATIENT X300
Yeah.

DOCTOR X300
Um I'll let you know as soon as I have the lab results.  Uh so when would you like to see me next time?

PATIENT X300
How long should I go I mean?

DOCTOR X300
Uh I think for you, everything is pretty stable, so a year should fine.  But if you wanted to see me earlier you an always schedule so it's up to you.

PATIENT X300
Oh yeah a year is fine.

DOCTOR X300
A year is fine okay.

PATIENT X300
So my cholesterol is 138?

DOCTOR X300
Uh yeah it's 136.

PATIENT X300
And the high side is?

DOCTOR X300
Your goal is 160.

PATIENT X300
Oh so I want to stay below 160?

DOCTOR X300
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Below 160.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Uh so this is not the total cholesterol, this is the bad cholesterol.

PATIENT X300
It's the bad.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
So in total cholesterol, good cholesterol and bad cholesterol are totally included so we did look at the bad cholesterol which is called LDL and that level is for you the goal is less than 160.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
Okay.  So this goal is different in each person.

PATIENT X300
You go by age?

DOCTOR X300
Um we go by age and we go by other things that you have.  If you have like diabetes, you need more tighter control.

PATIENT X300
Oh.

DOCTOR X300
If you've ever had a heart attack, uh that takes more tighter control.

PATIENT X300
Right.

DOCTOR X300
So things like that.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
So if you develop some medical problems then your goal is becoming lower but for now your only risk factor right now is just age.  You're older than 45 and this is counted as more risk factor.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300
And that's it.  You don't have hypertension and you don't have other factors.

PATIENT X300
Alright what is hypertension?

DOCTOR X300
Oh high blood pressure.

PATIENT X300
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X300
It's hypertension.

PATIENT X300
Oh I didn't know what it was.

DOCTOR X300
You know so.

PATIENT X300
Yeah cause I don't have it, it was all normal.

DOCTOR X300
Yeah, a good thing.  Okay sir, so I have nothing to offer you today.

PATIENT X300
Yeah that's fine.

DOCTOR X300
You're in good and I will just order the medication for you and they can mail it to you.

PATIENT X300
Okay.

DOCTOR X300

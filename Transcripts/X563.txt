DOCTOR X563
Um.

PATIENT X563
Cause my blood pressure's been okay and when I first ran out I started having headaches but then after the headaches went away everything was okay.

DOCTOR X563
So you have to take it because you have CHF right?  Is that correct?

PATIENT X563
Who?

DOCTOR X563
You do.  Are you taking the hydralazine, you should be taking it with the hydralazine.

PATIENT X563
Well.

DOCTOR X563
Cause they're both it's like a pill that goes with the hydralazine.

PATIENT X563
I know.

DOCTOR X563
Are you still taking the hydralazine?

PATIENT X563
Yes but I haven't been taking the other thing for two months, you can just take the other pill, I don't want to be off and on.

DOCTOR X563
No that's why it's a problem that you stopped it yeah.  Cause no one took you off from it, you just ran out right?

PATIENT X563
Yes it ran out and nobody wouldn't ever refill it back until I came here.  I don't see this doctor in this clinic for like six months and the medication runs out before that time and I got to come back in here and refill it cause.

DOCTOR X563
Alright well we've got to make sure that you have refills.  So can I refill that?

PATIENT X563

PATIENT X563
Okay wait a minute, wait a minute.

DOCTOR X563
@@@.

PATIENT X563
I don't want to die.

DOCTOR X563
Well it's a medication that's to be taken with the hydralazine for your CHF.

PATIENT X563
But, but.

DOCTOR X563
For your heart failure.

PATIENT X563
Right but since I haven't took it in.

DOCTOR X563
Yeah but it's not gonna make a difference in two months, it's the long term effects.

PATIENT X563
I know but when I stopped taking it I had headaches for about a month.  Now the headaches went away so if I get back on it the headaches gonna come back on me until it you know I take it for a while cause it get back into the system?

DOCTOR X563
Well were you having headaches while you took it or?

PATIENT X563
No, soon as I stopped taking it.

DOCTOR X563
Or were you having headaches after?

PATIENT X563
Soon as I ran out.

DOCTOR X563
Okay.

PATIENT X563
I started having headaches, almost every day.  I was taking Tylenol for it and then after about a month I got it where it started going away.

DOCTOR X563
Alright.  I'm gonna go ahead and renew it.  Cause if you don't want to take it.

PATIENT X563
I mean, uh uh you the doctor now if you say take it I'm gonna take it cause I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm just taking things that I have.

DOCTOR X563
Alright.  Well I don't want it, if it's causing you headaches that.

PATIENT X563
No I said.  When I ran out it gave me headaches, not while taking it.

DOCTOR X563
Well do you want me to renew it or not?

PATIENT X563
Now why you keep @@@ up?  @@@.

DOCTOR X563
Why should I have a renewal on medicine if you're not gonna take it?

PATIENT X563
Oh if you say I have to take it, I will take it.

DOCTOR X563
You should take it with your CHF.  So I'll order it.  Your CHF has been pretty controlled so if you feel like you're doing well without it you could just keep monitoring it.

PATIENT X563
Okay keep monitoring.

DOCTOR X563
Um.

PATIENT X563
Cause I'm trying to get the.

DOCTOR X563
Are you using the capsaicin stuff, the cream?

PATIENT X563
For my feet?

DOCTOR X563
It's wherever you have pain.

PATIENT X563
No I ain't, you can stop that too.

DOCTOR X563
Alright.

PATIENT X563
Uh.

DOCTOR X563
Um what about the calcium and vitamin D, are you taking that?

PATIENT X563
Uh that pill once a month?

DOCTOR X563
No twice a day.  Are you still taking it or not?

PATIENT X563
No.

DOCTOR X563
Calcium and vitamin D are you taking it?

PATIENT X563
Oh calcium yeah I'm taking that.

DOCTOR X563
Okay I'll renew that.  Um and then what about aspirin?  Baby aspirin, are you taking that?

PATIENT X563
Yes.

DOCTOR X563
You should take that okay good.  And the insulin?

PATIENT X563
Right.

DOCTOR X563
We might have to change that so I'm gonna leave that for now; we'll work on that later.  Are you taking the simvastatin for the cholesterol?

PATIENT X563
I ran out of that.

DOCTOR X563
Alright well you need to start taking that again.

PATIENT X563
Yes.

DOCTOR X563
I'll renew that.  

PATIENT X563
So you got to what's that renew it or refill it.

DOCTOR X563
Yeah.

PATIENT X563

DOCTOR X563
Um the @@@, you're @@@ on that right?

PATIENT X563
Yes.

DOCTOR X563
Uh are you still taking the Lasix?

PATIENT X563
That's the water pill.

DOCTOR X563
Yeah and you're taking that.

PATIENT X563
I ran out of that.

DOCTOR X563
Okay.  I'll renew that.  

PATIENT X563
And I got a question for you.

DOCTOR X563
What, you can ask it.

PATIENT X563
Okay.  The reason why I don't want to get back on that what isosorbide.

DOCTOR X563
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X563
Because I can't take Viagra with that.

DOCTOR X563
Right you definitely cannot.

PATIENT X563
Right so that's why I don't want to get back on it cause I want to get back, I can't get Viagra.

DOCTOR X563
Well you still can't get back on Viagra because it's dangerous for your heart to use that but definitely not when your taking that medication.  What about hydralazine?

PATIENT X563
I'm taking that.

DOCTOR X563
Okay.  The reason why I don't want to put you back on the Viagra to be honest is that if you were to have a heart attack and you needed nitrates that'd be really dangerous.  Um are you taking the metoprolol still?

PATIENT X563
Yeah.  So they say I don't need to have sex and that's it.

DOCTOR X563
Well I don't want to tell you don't have sex.

PATIENT X563
Yeah @@@ I can't even get that @@@ to work.  One of the pills, one of them come.

DOCTOR X563
And you can't have sex without it?

PATIENT X563
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X563
Well I'll talk to DOCTOR I just with all the medications that you're taking, probably that's probably one of the reasons too.

PATIENT X563
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X563
Let me talk to DOCTOR.  Okay I think that we got through all your medications enough so we're in a good place now.

PATIENT X563
Okay.

DOCTOR X563
Alright, I'll sign all of this.

PATIENT X563
I had blood work would that let you know if I need the insulin, I mean not the insulin, the anemia shot or do I have to wait till I go back upstairs.

DOCTOR X563
We put in your medicines but I think your blood work was fine actually that's why I don't want to um.

PATIENT X563
Okay.

DOCTOR X563
Let me look.  I'll look at it but I remember I was glancing at it before and I think it looked fine.

PATIENT X563
And the less shots I take that's cool with me.  Oh, I need some, I used to get this nasal spray.  It's uh.

DOCTOR X563
Yeah why do you need the nasal spray?

PATIENT X563
Cause I get, my nose shuts off at night, it closes.  I can't hardly breathe.  I used to get it but then I ran out and never refilled it uh I forgot the name of it.  It was @@@, something like that.  When the bottle say to use by such and such I throwed it away.  I should have kept it.  I forgot the name of it.

DOCTOR X563
Was it flunisolide, looks like they're sending, would like some more?

PATIENT X563
No it just squirt like that, squeeze it up there, it's like a solution uh.

DOCTOR X563
Yeah I think that's flunisolide @@@.

PATIENT X563
It's the name like BC.

DOCTOR X563
Hmm, I don't know that doesn't sound familiar but I'll give you something.  We'll be fine; you take two sprays up your nose with that.

PATIENT X563
What's the name of that?

DOCTOR X563
Flunisolide it's the thing that you put up your nose.  I think it'll help you.

PATIENT X563
Okay.  You can mail that to me.

DOCTOR X563
Okay.  Alright.  And what else, oh your @@@ were sent to you.

PATIENT X563
Oh since I take it Saturday night once a day it works out pretty good.

DOCTOR X563
When did you start taking this at night?  That was a while ago right?

PATIENT X563
Yeah.

DOCTOR X563
So the problem is, is what has it been?

PATIENT X563
It's been, if I go to sleep with my sugar at 200 I can last till 6 o'clock in the morning but if I go less than 200 about 1 o'clock if I don't eat a half a sandwich or something at night at about 1 or 12 o'clock, by 6 in the morning in the morning it be about 40 something.

DOCTOR X563
Okay.

PATIENT X563
So since I keep it at 200 I wake up it be a decent thing in the morning, like 90 to 108, 102.

DOCTOR X563
How much are you taking?

PATIENT X563
Uh I think 12 units.

DOCTOR X563
Okay.

PATIENT X563
But it varies from 12 to 14 I think.

DOCTOR X563
Do you ever feel when your sugar goes low?

PATIENT X563
Nope.  Except if I'm walking I might just fall down I know it get me.

DOCTOR X563
So do you take any um, any insulin with food with your.

PATIENT X563
With food.

DOCTOR X563
What food, with your meals?

PATIENT X563
Oh uh I takes it at bedtime.  This is after dinner.

DOCTOR X563
Oh so you don't take it ever with the meals?

PATIENT X563
No this one.

DOCTOR X563
But if you're um.

PATIENT X563
This is 10 o'clock at night before I go to bed so I done ate dinner and everything.

DOCTOR X563
So um do you take your finger stick, how often do you check your glucose during the day?

PATIENT X563
Twice.

DOCTOR X563
So once in the morning and once at night?

PATIENT X563
Yep.

DOCTOR X563
What about in the midday?

PATIENT X563
No I ain’t punching myself that many times, that's why I only have one shot.  I get.

DOCTOR X563
Would you be willing to take more than one shot?

PATIENT X563
No.  So what I do is I just eat lunch anyway, you know what I'm saying.  Cause I know it usually, it be, go down between that time, between 7 in the morning and 12 I know it's about time to eat so I then ate so there wasn't no reason to take it.  But do you want me to go back to it?

DOCTOR X563
Well I just wanted you to see, cause it's weird that your sugars are down so low at night.  I was hoping that we could get you to check your sugar maybe three or four times a day for the next couple weeks and then we can adjust it.

PATIENT X563
Adjust it again?

DOCTOR X563
Yeah.

PATIENT X563
But you know, one of those things is you gotta stick yourself.

DOCTOR X563
Well, one other @@@.

PATIENT X563
They have one, it's on TV it says put it on your arm and wait till your blood strip.

DOCTOR X563

PATIENT X563
Yeah.

DOCTOR X563
It's still doing it?

PATIENT X563
No every, I get it when I go back in there.

DOCTOR X563
Okay.

PATIENT X563
When I be constipated I got to go back in there and strain.

DOCTOR X563
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X563
But then after I get that first excuse me poop out, I'll be okay.

DOCTOR X563
Alright so what I want you to do, seriously, is do you think for two weeks you could take @@@ and check your blood sugars three or four times a day and then come back in and see our pharmacist to adjust your insulin?

PATIENT X563
Are you gonna give me an appointment to come back in and see the pharmacist?

DOCTOR X563
Yeah.

PATIENT X563
Okay.

DOCTOR X563
In two weeks.  Would you do it, just for two weeks?

PATIENT X563

DOCTOR X563
I know it's a pain in the butt but I just get worried that your sugar goes so low and I want to see what it's kind of doing throughout the day.

PATIENT X563
Alright.

DOCTOR X563
And then we can adjust the insulin as needed.

PATIENT X563

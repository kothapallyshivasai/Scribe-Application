As far as your afib flutter, okay you had an ICD placed uh very good and okay your rhythm and rate were strong.  Did they ever do what they call cardioversion for you?  Meaning uh give you a medication to put your heart back in a normal rhythm or give you a shock to your heart to put it back into normal rhythm?

As far as the okay, so we have, let me just bring you up in here.  You have another medication that has expired so I need to, there we go.  Active and recently expired, there we go.  So you're taking Bumex, that's your water pill right?  Um three times daily and then one tablet twice daily okay.  And they've got you on carvedilol okay.  How much carvedilol are you taking?

That's the weatherman for you.

DOCTOR X438
Yeah.  @@@ looked up though.  Okay.  No they're not.

PATIENT X438
No but I just went in at 7:30 this morning and you know I talked to DOCTOR.  I generally get a chest x-ray every year.  I don't remember the conversation she and I had about the chest x-rays.  I @@@ deem it necessary.

DOCTOR X438
Uh.

PATIENT X438
But one of the reasons I get a chest x-ray every year, other than the fact that I smoke, @@@ anyway but I'm a retired chemist.

DOCTOR X438
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X438
And I work around some pretty uh carcinogenic and toxic chemicals, plus I was exposed to Agent Orange.

DOCTOR X438
Are you having any symptoms?  Any coughs or shortness of breath?

PATIENT X438
No.

DOCTOR X438
No.

PATIENT X438
You know I really don't have any.  Is it on that side or this side?

DOCTOR X438
Oh a lump?

PATIENT X438
No not that.  There's a discoloration in the skin.

DOCTOR X438
You know it's barely noticeable. 

PATIENT X438
@@@.  And they had that Agent Orange mainly on the ground and this whole part of my face broke out and I noticed it.

DOCTOR X438
No. 

PATIENT X438
Maybe that's an individual thing.

DOCTOR X438
I don't think so.

PATIENT X438 
Or something, KF or whatever I don't know.  It's not giving me any problem.

DOCTOR X438
Okay.

PATIENT X438
I just happen to notice it.

DOCTOR X438
It's been there since you were young then?  Since you were in Vietnam?

PATIENT X438
Yeah.

DOCTOR X438

PATIENT X438
But uh you know I didn't get the chest x-ray, what was the determination?  Do you think it's necessary this year or?

SECOND DOCTOR X438

PATIENT X438
Well, it's just a nervous habit.

FIRST DOCTOR X438

FIRST DOCTOR X438
You're absolutely right with that, just having something in your hands and.

PATIENT X438

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Oh really, when was that?

PATIENT X438
About five years ago.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
The pain is gone since?

PATIENT X438
Oh yeah.  Let me ask you a question, it ain't got nothing to do with me.

DOCTOR X438
Sure.

PATIENT X438
Usually when you have cancer, carcinoma.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X438
How long does it take that to grow?

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Depending on what cancer it is.

PATIENT X438
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Um do you have a specific cancer in mind that?

PATIENT X438
Uh spine.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Spine like bone cancer or what?  It kind of depends on the type of cancer.  Cause some cancers are really aggressive right so you can have them grow really fast.

PATIENT X438
Yeah like lung cancer spreads to the.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Right.

PATIENT X438
Somewhere else.  No I was just asking cause of my sister.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
It does seem like colon cancer that can start out with something like a polyp.

PATIENT X438
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Real little and @@@ and so it kind of really depends on the actual.

PATIENT X438
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Cancer.  @@@.

PATIENT X438
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Spinal symptoms?

PATIENT X438

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Oh so was it just diagnosed?

PATIENT X438
Well yeah they just found it lately.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
What kind of cancer?

PATIENT X438
Well they said she had a mass on her spine uh her liver, @@@ it's just you know metastasizing all over now.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Really.  How old is she?

PATIENT X438
77.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
@@@.

PATIENT X438
@@@ quite a few times @@@.  First of the year, before they used to give um @@@ instead of the one time, different forms of cancer and that's a waste of meds or maybe I just.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Um.

PATIENT X438
Like if it was a lung cancer, you know coughing problems, blood or whatever.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Yeah, that could.

PATIENT X438
Colon cancer you know there's blood in the stool.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
@@@.

PATIENT X438
There's still @@@ no sudden warning signs.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Like @@@.  Is that what you mean?

PATIENT X438
Well it used to be fucking media thing.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Yeah wouldn't say it was a media.

PATIENT X438
Right that's what I'm saying.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
You're absolutely right except it's not that we um, that's sort of definitely @@@.

PATIENT X438
But generally when you got through uh physical metamorphosis that means that if you know, it's gotten to the point you know I don't want to say what you would call it.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
Right when you have symptoms probably.

PATIENT X438
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR X438
But unfortunately they send, tell me there are some studies to see where it is beneficial to people @@@ having symptoms.

PATIENT X438
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X438
So certain studies we do @@@.

PATIENT X438
Yeah, it's mainly just the fear @@@.

DOCTOR X438
Right.  But you haven't had one in a while but sometimes when people get older they opt not to have it anymore.

PATIENT X438

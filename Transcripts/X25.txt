PATIENT X25
When I do do the exercises I take, it's usually a half hour.

DOCTOR X25
Half hour, how often are you doing it?

PATIENT X25
Uh I used to do it every day and now I do it about twice a week.

DOCTOR X25
Okay.  I'm not happy with that.  Every day is much better.  I know it's hard sometimes but ideally I would say at least four times a week.

PATIENT X25
Well since I've been unemployed, you know uh my schedule has changed, now I'm driving my daughter to school every day and uh, to classes and uh, so what I do in the morning, instead of getting up and doing my exercising, then take a shower and leaving I'm getting up, taking a shower and dashing out the door to run my daughter to classes you know.

DOCTOR X25
I gotcha.  Are you saying, I know pressures and everything.

PATIENT X25
Yeah.

DOCTOR X25
But I still want you to exercise alright.

PATIENT X25
Okay.  You know @@@ started walking two miles.

DOCTOR X25
Okay.

PATIENT X25
I like walking you know.

DOCTOR X25
And walking outside is kind of usually not easy.  @@@.

PATIENT X25
No nothing, nothing.  @@@ Just so you know I've been putting my mother-in-law before she passed away two years ago now, she had, she was in her late 80s, she had a fungus on her feet.

DOCTOR X25
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X25
And uh she was using an iodine soak you know.

DOCTOR X25
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X25
And so I started using it, @@@.  Iodine.

DOCTOR X25
Is it helping a bit?

PATIENT X25
Well it seems to be @@@ a little bit.  It looks bad but it could be worse.

DOCTOR X25
@@@.

PATIENT X25
@@@.

DOCTOR X25
@@@.

PATIENT X25
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X25

DOCTOR X25
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X25
Really.

DOCTOR X25
Yeah.

PATIENT X25
Okay.

DOCTOR X25
If that doesn't work @@@.

PATIENT X25
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X25
I would just use that probably until we see if it's not working, takes about 14 days to work up, alright.

PATIENT X25
Okay, oh every day?

DOCTOR X25
Yes.

PATIENT X25
Okay.

DOCTOR X25
Use it exactly as the directions on the box.

PATIENT X25
Okay, alright, works for rash, okay.  Let me take my shirt off so I can show you.

DOCTOR X25
You know so many people walk in here.

PATIENT X25
Okay.

DOCTOR X25
@@@.

PATIENT X25
No @@@.  It gets real noticeable when I itch it and once in a while, @@@ gets really noticeable and then it spreads out @@@ and uh to my crotch uh, @@@ right there and if I keep myself powdered.

DOCTOR X25
Okay.

PATIENT X25
It's usually okay but um, I mean I'd never had it until I was in Vietnam.  I came back and when I came back from Vietnam I mean while I was there I got it.

DOCTOR X25
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X25
And when I came back I went to the, you know I'm not @@@ what it is.  I've never, you know I've never seen anything like it alright.

DOCTOR X25
@@@ skin tags.

PATIENT X25
@@@ longer.  @@@.  Hold your hand.  @@@.

DOCTOR X25
@@@.  Like down here.

PATIENT X25
It gets real pronounced.

DOCTOR X25
Okay.

PATIENT X25
It gets real pronounced and if I sweat a lot then it gets tender and it moves you know.

DOCTOR X25
Well I think that's a lot of skin irritation from sweat, like something.  If it's in the arm pits and the groins, you actually do sweat there @@@.

PATIENT X25
Yeah I know @@@.

DOCTOR X25
@@@.

PATIENT X25
@@@ I mean cause I never had it until then it came.

DOCTOR X25
Yeah I know when, you know went to Vietnam.  So a lot of you guys @@@.

PATIENT X25
@@@.

DOCTOR X25
@@@ right.

PATIENT X25
Should I put my shirt on?

DOCTOR X25
Yes.

PATIENT X25
Okay.

DOCTOR X25
Um so you know I think.

PATIENT X25
You don't know.

DOCTOR X25
I mean what I would recommend right now is you continue keeping yourself you know @@@ dry uh and then but it's just, it's not something like @@@ from now.  I could have you see the dermatologist I just don't know if they can actually treat it, other than just keeping this up with good hygiene.

PATIENT X25
Well, when my.  Here's the book.

DOCTOR X25
Okay.

PATIENT X25
Uh, I get more of it.

DOCTOR X25
Right, no I understand.

PATIENT X25
In the areas that I don't even you know, @@@ and uh then when I came back I was living with my folks for a while.

DOCTOR X25
Yeah.

PATIENT X25
My ma used my towel and she got the rash.

DOCTOR X25
Okay.

PATIENT X25
I says well I'll find out you know, all these years you know, she still has it too now you know.  @@@.  That's the only reason I'm mentioning it you know.

DOCTOR X25
Okay.  You should tell her to have her talk to the doctors and see if they can come up with anything new okay and the same way @@@ okay.

PATIENT X25
Oh sure.

DOCTOR X25

DOCTOR X25

PATIENT X25
I mean the VA doctors, like I said, disregarded it.

DOCTOR X25
No we'll check it out.

PATIENT X25
And then uh and then my regular doctors uh said well the one doctor said he thought it was ring worm and I says it's not ring worm and then he looked at it closer and he says no you're right it's not, it's some kind of fungus or rather some kind of rash and then uh my doctor that I had most recently said you know, he told me to come to the VA but I think I'm you know, I was turned down by you guys, I'm not going to come here again you know.  At that time, I wasn't signed up you know.

DOCTOR X25
No no problem.

PATIENT X25
I didn't want to bother you guys with that kind of you know uh thing since it was turned down but geez I you know.  Now that I'm in it, I figured well maybe you should take a look at it because it.

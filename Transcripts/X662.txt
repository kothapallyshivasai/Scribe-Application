DOCTOR X662
I'm just pulling you up here in the computer and I can't see when the last time we saw you here in the Unit.

PATIENT X662
Last week.

DOCTOR X662
Oh you were talking to the pharmacist.

PATIENT X662

DOCTOR X662
So I see you were in the hospital recently.

PATIENT X662
Yeah.

DOCTOR X662
Is that correct?

PATIENT X662
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X662
Let me sort through this to make sure to see what's here.  You were in because of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting okay.

PATIENT X662
They said gastro something; anyway it was probably messed up.  Right.

DOCTOR X662
You know I'm reading through what they wrote here and let's see, looks like they gave you some.  Well essentially things just kind of got better.

PATIENT X662
Yes.

DOCTOR X662
Without doing anything.  That's probably the gist of it.

PATIENT X662
Yes.

DOCTOR X662
I mean just a little bit of tincture of time.

PATIENT X662
Right.

DOCTOR X662
They said that got.

PATIENT X662
Once I started eating solid cause I couldn't hold nothing down for a minute and they were giving me a stomach pill and all kind of stuff but like you said eventually it came where.

DOCTOR X662
@@@ got better.  

PATIENT X662
But you know doc I'm still concerned about this blood clot in this right leg lower calf.  That's why I'm on the blood thinner.

DOCTOR X662
That's a fact so uh we need more blood work.  You have that.  When did that show up?

PATIENT X662
Um about let's see uh January, February, March, January yeah.

DOCTOR X662
In both legs?

PATIENT X662
Yes.

DOCTOR X662
Alright okay.  That can happen, why did you get them?

PATIENT X662
They just popped up.  You know I had fell, you know initially I fell on my elbow and my knee.

DOCTOR X662
Yeah.

PATIENT X662
And I guess that caused it for some reason you know.

DOCTOR X662
Were you not walking around or?

PATIENT X662
No I mean I could step up on the curb and my foot slipped back down and I lost my balance and I fell and the next thing I know two days later my leg swell up you know.

DOCTOR X662
Okay.  Trauma can sometimes cause these actually.

PATIENT X662
Yeah.

DOCTOR X662
Yeah.  Did they ever say you had clots in your lungs or just the legs?

PATIENT X662
No just in the leg.  Ooh if it get up that far I might be a nobody.

DOCTOR X662
That's actually true.

PATIENT X662
Yeah.

DOCTOR X662
So you have been on Coumadin since.

PATIENT X662
For the leg.

DOCTOR X662
October of 2010 does that sound about right?

PATIENT X662
Yes.

DOCTOR X662
Now.

PATIENT X662
I was on Warfarin too; I mean they had me on.

DOCTOR X662
You're still on that right though.

PATIENT X662
Yeah well no they took me off the Warfarin, I'm just on the uh injections; the, I can't even pronounce it.  The what.

DOCTOR X662
Um the dalteparin or?

PATIENT X662

DOCTOR X662
You're not taking the Levitra from okay.  Is that where you were just going to be continued to take?

PATIENT X662

DOCTOR X662

PATIENT X662
Exactly.

DOCTOR X662
Okay so.

PATIENT X662
Fluctuating up and down, up and down.

DOCTOR X662
Yeah.

PATIENT X662
Change in my diet and all that.  And then somehow they say I'm borderline diabetic.  Now all this is starting to occur after the fact of these blood clots.

DOCTOR X662
I don't think I would attribute that to blood clots.

PATIENT X662
Well I was just saying generally you know.

DOCTOR X662

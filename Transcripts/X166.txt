DOCTOR X166
Good to see you again. 

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
It's been a while.

PATIENT X166
Yeah it has.

DOCTOR X166
I think I met you one time right?

PATIENT X166
Yeah once or twice.

DOCTOR X166
Back in like @@@.  How have things been?  I saw you were recently in the hospital for a day or so.

PATIENT X166
Yeah I was having uh respiratory problems.  I was short of breath and I'd run my medication out and with the heat that we were having at 10 o'clock. 

DOCTOR X166
I think you called August 6th.

PATIENT X166
It was on the 7th I think.

DOCTOR X166
For a refill.

PATIENT X166
It might have been yeah either the 6th or 7th is when I came in.

DOCTOR X166
Yeah and no essentially that same day you went into the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X166
Yeah, yeah it was that day.

DOCTOR X166
Hmm.  Next time call earlier.

PATIENT X166
Oh yeah, that's right.

DOCTOR X166
Why didn't you call earlier?

PATIENT X166
I really just lost track of it.  Cause I'd been pretty much surviving on my back-up.

DOCTOR X166
What's your back-up?  The albuterol or?

PATIENT X166
That one I've got listed.  Proventil.

DOCTOR X166
Okay.  Yeah the albuterol.  Um how many times a week have you been using the albuterol?

PATIENT X166
Um two, maybe three times a week.  Not so much now that the weather is cooling off again.

DOCTOR X166
Okay.  Two or, say it again once or twice a week?

PATIENT X166
Twice.

DOCTOR X166
Twice a week.

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
What's your current asthma medication regimen?

PATIENT X166
Uh it's, if I saw it I'd know it.  I can't think of it off the.  It's the thing that counts uh, does this look like.

DOCTOR X166
Mometasone okay so you're taking that.  How often are you using that?

PATIENT X166
Once a day.

DOCTOR X166
Okay and then what about, are you using any like nasal spray or anything like that?

PATIENT X166
I got a nasal spray that I use from time to time but it's not, it's not a regular day to day thing.

DOCTOR X166
Okay and you haven't seen the pulmonary doctors in a while right?

PATIENT X166
Right.

DOCTOR X166
Were you using a medicine called, let's see, flunisolide, the nasal spray is flunisolide right and you're using mometasone.  What about formoterol?  Were you ever on that medicine?

PATIENT X166
Not that I can remember.

DOCTOR X166
And your breathing since you've been discharged in August?

PATIENT X166
Right.

DOCTOR X166
Kind of using albuterol twice a week and your mometasone once a day.

PATIENT X166
Once a day yeah.

DOCTOR X166
And um no coughing, shortness of breath or anything?  Good.  What was the trigger?  Like what brought you in?

PATIENT X166
Well I think it was the humidity and the heat and I cut my own grass and I do stuff around the house so uh.  You know whatever house-like allergies there might be but I don't necessarily, I'm not necessarily affected by.

DOCTOR X166
Okay.

PATIENT X166
But the combination of the heat.

DOCTOR X166
Running out of your meds.

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
Where do you get the albuterol from?  You don't have that listed in our medicine regimen.

PATIENT X166
No when in remission.  I get it here.

DOCTOR X166
You get it from here?

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
Mometasone.

PATIENT X166
That's what I get.  Right.

DOCTOR X166
And you have enough of these at home?

PATIENT X166
Uh and I had another one in 2000.

DOCTOR X166
Make sure that gets on your medicine list.  Um how have other things been going?

PATIENT X166
Everything's been going, oh I was wondering if I could get a reinstatement on that @@@ that I'm getting.

DOCTOR X166
Sure.

PATIENT X166
On a monthly basis.

DOCTOR X166
So you saw that, I think it's @@@ to some of your testosterone levels, your free testosterone levels came back a little low which could be contributing to your erectile dysfunction.

PATIENT X166
That could have been it.

DOCTOR X166
How is your mood and are you like you know.

PATIENT X166
My mood.

DOCTOR X166
Your libido, like you're feeling.

PATIENT X166
Oh I feel good.

DOCTOR X166
Okay.

PATIENT X166
That may be a little low too cause I haven't been, you know like I said I haven't had that medication at all and uh, I haven't been as active as I was so.

DOCTOR X166
Well you know it might be worth treating it then, so we can just put like a @@@ might consider a patch but uh a testosterone patch, that can help replace the testosterone.  It's actually quite common you know and @@@.  If you have a deficiency but uh, yeah like yours was, your free testosterone was 0.9 and 1.5 is the lower end of normal.  Yours is definitely low.  One thing we could do is repeat it and see where you are today and then consider putting you on that.

PATIENT X166
Yeah I would repeat it and see where we're at with it after.  It's been a while since I had that vardenafil.

DOCTOR X166
How many times are you have sexual intercourse?

PATIENT X166
Uh well more like once a month.

DOCTOR X166
Once a month?  Okay.

PATIENT X166
Currently.  

DOCTOR X166
Um okay so the last time you were here we measured your prostate-specific antigen, the PSA.

PATIENT X166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X166
A blood test that kind of measures the growth of your prostate um and it can be used for screening for colon cancer or prostate cancer but it has some downfalls um.  @@@ false positives.

PATIENT X166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X166
@@@.  But then yours has elevated from 06-07 it went up kind of quickly but then from September of 07 to January 09 it was more of the same.  I definitely want to repeat that.

PATIENT X166
Yeah I think in April is when I had the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR X166
Yeah you had the colonoscopy in April of 09.  That showed one small polyp.

PATIENT X166
Yeah they removed that.

DOCTOR X166
They removed it.  It was a tubular adenoma which is a benign growth but it's actually not entirely benign in the sense that it could have potential to develop into a malignancy but that takes many years.  That's why they do a colonoscopy to @@@ with it.

PATIENT X166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X166
They're recommending getting a repeat colonoscopy in five to seven years.  I prefer to get it in five so you want to remain healthy.

PATIENT X166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X166
We want to make sure we don't miss anything.  Um, are you having any like urinary symptoms like a weak stream, dribbling stream?

PATIENT X166
Sometimes weak.

DOCTOR X166
Sometimes weak.

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
How many times a night are you going to the bathroom?

PATIENT X166
Uh generally I'm waking up once a night.

DOCTOR X166
Once night, not to bad.  What about intermittency where you start and stop when urinating?

PATIENT X166
Maybe once.

DOCTOR X166
Once in a while?

PATIENT X166
Once in a while.

DOCTOR X166
So we'll get that repeat colonoscopy in 2012.  Looks like you're up-to-date on all your shots.  The flu shot is coming like in a week or so.

PATIENT X166
Okay.

DOCTOR X166
So make sure you come and get that.

PATIENT X166
I'll come and get it.

DOCTOR X166
Um.

PATIENT X166
I had the pneumonia I think a couple years ago, shot.

DOCTOR X166
Are you able to come back to get some fasting blood work because I want to check.

PATIENT X166
Sure.

DOCTOR X166
Your cholesterol, I want to check your prostate antigen, I want to check some screening for diabetes.

PATIENT X166
Actually I have, I could do it today if you want.

DOCTOR X166
Are you fasting?

PATIENT X166
I haven't had anything since 6 or 7 last night.

DOCTOR X166
Coffee?

PATIENT X166
Nothing.

DOCTOR X166
Okay let's do it, let's do it today then.  Um I want to check a few things.  So if that testosterone comes back low I'll find out today or tomorrow, would you consider going on the testosterone patch?  It's a patch you wear on your arm, it has to be removed and changed once a day but you know it might give you energy.  It might give you more libido.

PATIENT X166
Sure.

DOCTOR X166
It might help with erectile dysfunction.

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
Now remember next time, even if your asthma's under great control, next time you run out of your medicines.

PATIENT X166
Then just get it.

DOCTOR X166
Oh you know a week ahead of time call.

PATIENT X166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X166
And it helps keep track of everyone and I hadn't seen you in a long time.

PATIENT X166
Yeah so, it'd been quite a while.

DOCTOR X166
Um which one did you run out of, was it the mometasone or the albuterol?

PATIENT X166
It was the one that uh, I think it’s mometasone.  The albuterol I had.

DOCTOR X166
Okay so I see it's on the list yeah.  Do you get any chest pain or pressure when you exert yourself?  Okay.  @@@.  Take some deep breaths in and out.  Appetite's good.

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
Any change in your weight up or down?

PATIENT X166
No.  I'm still at 150.

DOCTOR X166
Swelling in your feet or legs?

PATIENT X166
No swelling problems, no swelling.

DOCTOR X166
Sleeping okay?

PATIENT X166
Yeah.

DOCTOR X166
Bleeding or bruising anywhere? 

PATIENT X166
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X166
Moving your bowels?

PATIENT X166
@@@ yeah.

DOCTOR X166
@@@.  Okay good.  Alright let me go talk to DOCTOR or one of the other supervising doctors and I'll be back shortly okay.

PATIENT X166
Okay.

DOCTOR X166
Get some blood work done today.  I want to have you come back, you know things are going okay now but of course if things change we'll see you sooner.

PATIENT X166
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X166
But maybe six months okay?

PATIENT X166
That's fine.

DOCTOR X166
And I'll stay in touch.  I'll give you a phone call about the testosterone and.

PATIENT X166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X166
The other blood work if it's abnormal.

PATIENT X166
Okay.

DOCTOR X166
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  42:36  DOCTOR IN:  49:48)

DOCTOR X166
So everything is the exact same as I talked about. 

PATIENT X166
Okay.

DOCTOR X166
With running your tests.  I just read your labs when we checked them.

PATIENT X166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X166
Your percent free, I'm just telling you why I can figure it but the percent free testosterone for you was low but that doesn't really mean anything cause your total testosterone and your total free testosterone were high.

PATIENT X166
Oh good.

DOCTOR X166
So not adequate.

PATIENT X166
Good.

DOCTOR X166
So we don't need to recheck the testosterone today.

PATIENT X166
Okay good enough.

DOCTOR X166
I'll just give you the refills on the medicines.  Um and I'll see you back in six months okay.

PATIENT X166
Okay.

DOCTOR X166
You can go just across the way to get labs done okay.

PATIENT X166
Sure.

DOCTOR X166
And I'll send it up to the Lab. 

PATIENT X166
So now where do I need to go for that?

DOCTOR X166
Right here.

PATIENT X166
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X166
@@@.

PATIENT X166

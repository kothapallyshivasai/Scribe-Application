PATIENT X389
I mean and I don't understand it either.  But like I said I've been, I take my medicine every day, same time every day.

DOCTOR X389

When I get up in the morning before I go to work and I try to eat something at home and I try to eat like oatmeal or something like that with it before I go to work and even after that you know I can get to work and you know be there like an hour or two and check my blood pressure and it'll still be high.  

DOCTOR X389

DOCTOR X389
Um and you were hospitalized once over the summer?

PATIENT X389
I believe I was in there twice.  I believe I was in there twice.  And then the hospital that I work in I was there for a day.  Like I had a, I went to the health nurse to have my blood pressure checked, it was high.

DOCTOR X389
When you were admitted at the time right?

PATIENT X389
Right they admitted me.  I was only there for a day.  Just the one, they released me that Monday around 6 o'clock that evening.  And again that was even after I had taken my blood pressure medicine.

DOCTOR X389
And you take your blood pressure at home right?

PATIENT X389
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X389
What is it at home?

PATIENT X389
Basically like the same thing like she just, like I got here you know 150 something over 100 or.

DOCTOR X389

DOCTOR X389

PATIENT X389

DOCTOR X389
Sure.  So you're on the metformin and glipizide right?

PATIENT X389
Yes.

DOCTOR X389
Alright.  Are you exercising at all?

PATIENT X389
A little bit, probably not as much as I can.  @@@.

DOCTOR X389
@@@.  

PATIENT X389
Yeah.

DOCTOR X389
Yeah it's a little cold back here but.

PATIENT X389
@@@.

DOCTOR X389
Same it's like 150 but your diastolic is high, it's over 100.  How about some deep breaths for me.  Big deep breaths.  Well you know I mean you're not really overweight.  I mean everyone else is @@@ we'd bring it up and everyone @@@ at least I don't know and you're young.  Can you lie back for me?  Any belly pain? 

PATIENT X389
No.

DOCTOR X389
Lift up your leg for me.

PATIENT X389
Like that?

DOCTOR X389
Yep.  Okay now this way good okay.  You can go ahead and sit up.  Okay I'll be right back.  Do you mind if I just go talk with my attending?  

DOCTOR OUT:  47:40  DOCTOR IN:  66:02

DOCTOR X389
So we need to figure out what to do to make sure there's nothing else going on with your blood pressure okay.  I want to check a bunch of tests.  Do you think um sometimes when you're, when the arteries going to the kidney are small that can cause that.  Sometimes different levels of hormones can cause it um.  So the most accurate way to do some of this stuff is to get actually a 24 hour urine collection.  Do you think you could do that?

PATIENT X389
Yeah.

DOCTOR X389
Okay.  The other thing I want to get is um well I'm gonna increase what you're on right now, the amlodipine I'm gonna increase to 10.  And then we need to get some labs today are you okay with that?

PATIENT X389
Yeah.

DOCTOR X389
Okay.

PATIENT X389
And then I'm gonna get um a, we'll get some urine tests today and then we'll @@@.  And the other thing the only way I really see if your renal arteries are smaller is to get a CAT scan.

DOCTOR X389
Uh-huh.  So I'm gonna order that.  Okay and then just make sure all these labs are put in.  And just we have to ask you, you don't use any drugs, no cocaine or anything like that?

PATIENT X389
No.

DOCTOR X389
You can get these labs today and then I think you could follow up with the pharmacist.  I'm gonna put in another order but you can, sometimes if you can't see me you know.

PATIENT X389
Yeah.

DOCTOR X389
Um if you can't see me you can see her and she can manage this stuff really well and I think it's important cause your blood pressure is so high and you're so young that can really have consequences.  Um so I think you should definitely follow up with her.  She should call you uh but I think the last time I don't think you showed up for the appointment.  So do follow up with her and then the other thing is um, you saw the eye doctor um, alright.  So for now what we'll do is I'm increasing your amlodipine to 10 mg and I'm gonna have that mailed to you.  I'm increasing your metoprolol to take a full tablet instead of a half tablet.

PATIENT X389
Okay.

DOCTOR X389
So 200 mg daily, this is gonna be 10 mg daily and then I would have those labs done today and then I also ordered a CAT scan.

PATIENT X389
Okay.

DOCTOR X389
Okay.  So come back and see me in three months um.  I would see the pharmacist in between.

PATIENT X389
Can't they make an appointment out here?

DOCTOR X389
Yeah.

PATIENT X389
Okay.

DOCTOR X389
CT scan and then labs today okay.

PATIENT X389
The CT today also or?

DOCTOR X389
No, no, no you can come back to get that.  I just say you need to get the labs today so I can look at them.

PATIENT X389
Okay.

DOCTOR X389
Okay.

PATIENT X389
Now this, the metoprolol so starting tomorrow morning just take 200?

DOCTOR X389
Yeah.

PATIENT X389
Just take a whole tablet.

DOCTOR X389
Yeah.

PATIENT X389
Okay can you uh have that sent?

DOCTOR X389
Everything's already being sent.

PATIENT X389
Okay.

DOCTOR X389
Yep.  And then the 24 hour urine, they'll tell you how to do that.  You'll have to send it back.

PATIENT X389
Okay.  So when I do that.

DOCTOR X389
Yeah depending on when you want to do it, they'll explain that.

PATIENT X389
Okay.

DOCTOR X389
Okay.

PATIENT X389
Alright.

DOCTOR X389
Alright.  And obviously if you have problems, you have a headache or dizziness @@@.  Okay.

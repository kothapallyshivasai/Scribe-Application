DOCTOR X565
You haven't seen anything okay.  And it's weird that it'll be just in one spot too.  But that's where you scratch it.  Did that start after you were scratching, there was nothing there that started to itch and then you were scratching?

PATIENT X565
Yeah there wasn't nothing here, it was like this.

DOCTOR X565
Okay and then it started to itch.

PATIENT X565
Yeah.

DOCTOR X565
And then you started scratching and then that came on.

PATIENT X565
Yeah that came but I was bleeding.

DOCTOR X565
So there might have been from scratching then from that?

PATIENT X565
Yeah, it was bleeding you know.  It don't itch right now.  But see @@@ there one time I didn't get any relief and the doctor gave me some allergy pills and then I I went and it was okay.  And then it came back again a real fit.

DOCTOR X565
When were you were seen for this?

PATIENT X565
Huh?

DOCTOR X565
When were you seen for this?

PATIENT X565
About a couple of months ago.  Two or three months, I can't remember.  Cause then it don't itch now.

DOCTOR X565
Okay here we go.  Did the medication help then?

PATIENT X565
Yes it did.

DOCTOR X565
Cause we're gonna give you probably something to help with your allergies anyway for the nose and it sounds like what they call allergic rhinitis where you just get a runny nose and it drips back and then one of the most common causes of cough, especially at night when you're on your back and it just kind of drips back and irritates the throat.

PATIENT X565
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X565
So I think that's why you're having a cough.

PATIENT X565
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X565
So I think we'll probably give you some of this now it'll be, I'll give you enough for a month and then a couple refills, we'll see how you're doing.

PATIENT X565
Okay.

DOCTOR X565
With that uh okay.  But doing good otherwise though?

PATIENT X565

DOCTOR X514
How are you sir? 

PATIENT X514
Finally got back, they had me all over the place.

DOCTOR X514
I know I saw you saw DOCTOR the last time you were here.

PATIENT X514
@@@ you or something.  They put me there.  No I didn't called @@@.  

DOCTOR X514
@@@ so have a seat.  Oh so how you doing?

PATIENT X514
Uh, like usual, you know.  Once you lose the @@@ you get the magnifying glass @@@.

DOCTOR X514
Alright so, how is the diabetes?

PATIENT X514
I don't have to worry about it, @@@ it's under control.

DOCTOR X514
Right.  How often do you check your sugar?

PATIENT X514
Well usually about once every three days.  Sometimes I'll go two weeks and if it's in danger or something's a little higher than I think it ought to be.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
Uh during different times, I've done it so much I know just what it should be at different times of the day.  I used to test it three times.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
I'll go ahead and do it each day one time.

DOCTOR X514
Okay.  What have you been getting recently?

PATIENT X514
It's usually between; it's higher now than it has been before but not much.  Uh it used to be between 80 something.  When I go on the starvation and get up in the morning, it used to be about 78, not over 87 but now it's usually between 87 and 100 and it kind of varies a little more.

DOCTOR X514
Okay.  Your uh, your hemoglobin A1c, the last one, was 5.8 that's perfect um.  

PATIENT X514
I know that uh.

DOCTOR X514
Great number.

PATIENT X514
Yes.

DOCTOR X514
You do have a little bit of protein in your urine.

PATIENT X514
Uh my deterioration, I had that before.

DOCTOR X514
Right.

PATIENT X514
But very little.  They're on the outside a bit?

DOCTOR X514
Yeah it's still very little um and we have you on the ACE inhibitor, the lisinopril so that's gonna slow that down as much as possible um.  Your creatinine, the measure of your kidney function is stable.

PATIENT X514
Yeah.

DOCTOR X514
So you know I think we're.

PATIENT X514
High or low or in the normal?

DOCTOR X514
Its 0.8, normal range.

PATIENT X514
It's.

DOCTOR X514
I'm good with that.  They told you about your prostate biopsy as well?

PATIENT X514
Yeah but I had a mother die and I was gone but uh you now I check it when I get on the website, I know about that.

DOCTOR X514
They put you on.

PATIENT X514
All 12 of them were negative.  I don't know if that means anything.  Just the minute they take the test you walk out the door and things change but uh.

DOCTOR X514
Right and uh so you know when they go in there and do that biopsy they essentially just stab it 12 times.

PATIENT X514
Yeah.

DOCTOR X514
To see if they can get something so you know they could have missed something but it's unlikely that they missed any significant prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer is usually a very slow growing thing so even if you had prostate cancer um you know it would be very unlikely that you have a highly malignant tumor.  So I would say following with the GU Clinic is probably the best thing.

PATIENT X514
We want to find out what's made the PSA go up.

DOCTOR X514
Right and there are a lot of things that can make the PSA go up.  How many times do you pee at night?

PATIENT X514
When sleeping?  Never.

DOCTOR X514
Never.  You can sleep through the whole night?

PATIENT X514
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X514
Okay.  When you go to the bathroom can you start right away or do you have to wait?

PATIENT X514
No I'm fine now.

DOCTOR X514
Fine.

PATIENT X514
But I had, so I told the other doctor about it, she got me on, I requested the uh.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
Uh what the heck is that clinic?

DOCTOR X514
The Urology Clinic.

PATIENT X514
Yeah the Urology Clinic.

DOCTOR X514
Right, right, right.

PATIENT X514
And they put me on the and that's the last @@@ thing, peak and flow.

DOCTOR X514
Right.  

PATIENT X514
It's much better now.

DOCTOR X514
It could have, the elevation in your PSA could have all just been from prostate enlargement.  That could explain every bit of it.  The PSA.

PATIENT X514
But it's not that enlarged.

DOCTOR X514
Right, but the PSA is not um a perfect test.  It is not specific for prostate malignancy in any way so if your prostate is enlarged it can cause an elevation in your PSA and it could be totally normal so I think we should just 100% follow this and I don't think.  The only curative therapy would be to have your prostate removed and I don't think that's probably something we were looking for at this point.  Um August is when your next colonoscopy is right.

PATIENT X514
That's right I need a consult.

DOCTOR X514
Right.  You don't need a consult you just need your labs here.

PATIENT X514
Uh NAME called me.

DOCTOR X514
They said you need a consult?

PATIENT X514
I have to probably get a consult.

DOCTOR X514
I'll put it in, I'll put it in there and I'll write it on here.

PATIENT X514
Yeah want the order so but I mean.

DOCTOR X514
Right, right.  You need your.

PATIENT X514
Get that one @@@.

DOCTOR X514
12 months.  

PATIENT X514
Should I go up to the @@@ Clinic in the hospital?

DOCTOR X514
Right, right, right.  Um and how's the knee?

PATIENT X514
Oh it's been fine.

DOCTOR X514
Everything fine, no problems?

PATIENT X514
Yeah, yeah. 

DOCTOR X514
Both of them doing well?

PATIENT X514
They're all fine.

DOCTOR X514
Good, good.

PATIENT X514
Unless they want to fuse this, like they wanted to do my wrist, how's that.

DOCTOR X514
Your ankle?  I mean it looks good to me.  Are you still doing the martial arts?

PATIENT X514
Oh hell yes.  I was worn out @@@ week now.

DOCTOR X514
Yeah your heart rate I remember your heart rate from last time.

PATIENT X514
@@@ fall.

DOCTOR X514
Probably a sign of good health as opposed to a sign of anything bad.

PATIENT X514
Well when we're old all things are going bad you know.

DOCTOR X514
No.

PATIENT X514
@@@ I want to do, I wish she'd stop calling, I actually want to the @@@ and I says no, no, no, it's on the right hemisphere, so I said we'll do a right @@@.  Well I had no idea of the potential for the genetics.  

DOCTOR X514
Did you see them at UIT?

PATIENT X514
Uh yeah and they kind of, you have to do that whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'll think about it.

DOCTOR X514
Did you get your genetic testing done?

PATIENT X514
No I never did it.

DOCTOR X514
Okay.

PATIENT X514
Not cause I didn't go up, I told them what I had but, nobody sits there and tells me what I'm gonna do.  It's not an exact science.

DOCTOR X514
Right, right.  And that's, I mean that's fair enough that obviously your decision.  That's not a small surgery so.

PATIENT X514
I know, you know I didn't want all 12 of them to be normal and.

DOCTOR X514
Fine we'll have you see the gastroenterologist again and I guess they'll take another look and you know we can go from there.

PATIENT X514
@@@.

DOCTOR X514
Right uh do you need refills of any medications?

PATIENT X514
Just be sure to check the uh, the uh, the uh oh man let me get the thought, yeah the new stuff they're giving me uh the ACE inhibitor.

DOCTOR X514
You have two refills left.

PATIENT X514
Oh I do have refills on the bottles?

DOCTOR X514
Yeah.

PATIENT X514
I never looked.

DOCTOR X514
Yeah.

PATIENT X514
Cause I @@@.  It seems to be working.  The only thing that's kind of embarrassing that I'm dealing with is I'm still getting blood though when I have sex, you know from the.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
Deal cause.

DOCTOR X514
When did that start?

PATIENT X514
Beg pardon?

DOCTOR X514
When did it start?

PATIENT X514
Oh man it didn't start till about three days or something like that after I got home.

DOCTOR X514
After the biopsy?

PATIENT X514
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X514
And has it improved?

PATIENT X514
Hmm I don't know uh.  My partner wouldn't be too happy.  @@@.

DOCTOR X514
But I mean is the amount of blood getting more or less?

PATIENT X514
Yeah it's getting much larger like it's starting to clot you know.

DOCTOR X514
Okay.

PATIENT X514
Something like that but I thought it was about two or three weeks sometimes a lot so.

DOCTOR X514
Right.

PATIENT X514
I wanted to let you know about it.

DOCTOR X514
Yeah and that's, no that's good and have you seen the urologist since then?

PATIENT X514
No.

DOCTOR X514
No okay.  You may, I mean obviously you know it happened after the biopsy, it's.

PATIENT X514
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X514
It's due to the biopsy.

PATIENT X514
Yeah.

DOCTOR X514
And your biopsy was how long ago?

PATIENT X514
Oh man I can't remember.

DOCTOR X514
It was in April on the 27th.

PATIENT X514
Yeah I knew it wasn't too long.

DOCTOR X514
So we're looking at about 30 days ago, no 20 days ago.  I would give it some time.  If it doesn't clear up, you need to be seen by the urologist.

PATIENT X514
If it gets worse I'll holler.

DOCTOR X514
If it gets worse you need to come in.

PATIENT X514
Yeah.

DOCTOR X514
If it doesn't clear up in a week or two you need to be seen by the urologist okay.

PATIENT X514
Guess what I got.  I winked at him and I said hey @@@, I love these new procedures I haven't seen them.  When I was in school I didn't have what they got now.  Give me uh a sonar picture of.

DOCTOR X514
Oh your prostate.

PATIENT X514
I got two of me, I gave him a @@@.

DOCTOR X514
Could you see anything?

PATIENT X514
No.

DOCTOR X514
Sometimes those ultrasounds are hard to read.

PATIENT X514
No, they're very easy, very distinct and clear.  I cleaned out @@@ so I could see all that.

DOCTOR X514
Alright.

PATIENT X514
There is something else I need to ask you.  I think everything's alright um.  Sometimes the alpha blocker works good, other times it hesitates and then with the flow.  I normally @@@.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
But I'll always have the bladder completely empty anyway.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
After I urinate, except it took longer and I wanted to jump on that, no that works so.

DOCTOR X514
Good.

PATIENT X514
Uh sometimes it'll cut down sometimes it'll be alright.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
The majority is better you know but I don't think there's anything else.

DOCTOR X514
Sounds good.  Let me take a listen to you real quick.  Deep breath.  Cough for me.  How much are you smoking?

PATIENT X514
No more than @@@.  I had one in November and then one in December.  Normally a pack will last me a month or more.  Probably about three a week, when I was down now but I just got back on Monday.

DOCTOR X514
So right now a pack will last you a month?

PATIENT X514
Oh yeah for a long time.  I've been smoking about three weeks.  You know when I was down, my mom died in November and my brother and I had been smoking about three cigarettes a week.

DOCTOR X514
Okay.

PATIENT X514
But more, I mean you can't do that with martial arts obviously.

DOCTOR X514
Alright.

PATIENT X514
Hard truth on the right, no wheezing or rales would be good in the lung right?

DOCTOR X514
Heart sounds great.  I think the most important thing is the fact that you live with a heart rate of 47.

PATIENT X514
So I'll live longer.

DOCTOR X514
Exactly.  That's a sign of good heart health in someone your age.

PATIENT X514
How about breathing control, its natural now, I feel normal.

DOCTOR X514
Pardon me?

PATIENT X514
Breathing control.

DOCTOR X514
Breathing control.

PATIENT X514
Through martial arts.

DOCTOR X514
Oh.

PATIENT X514
It just normally drops everything.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
So I don't know.

DOCTOR X514
It's working for you.

PATIENT X514
I don't know if that's cheating my health or not you know.

DOCTOR X514
I think it's probably helping more than anything alright.

PATIENT X514
Yeah.

DOCTOR X514
Let me go talk to uh DOCTOR and we'll get you moving alright.  Good to see you again.

PATIENT X514
When you're not here.

DOCTOR X514
Well he wasn't here earlier.  I don't know if he's going to be in later today or not.  He's a busy guy.  He has a lot of meetings.  

PATIENT X514
@@@.

DOCTOR X514
He does, he uh is one of the deans at the medical college so he's involved in a lot.

PATIENT X514
He took the other one.

DOCTOR X514
@@@ right.

PATIENT X514
He always had it.

DOCTOR X514
Um he used to be really high up cause he's a dual board certified in medicine and pediatrics.  He used to be one of the big guys in the Pediatric Department but now he's kind of transitioned to one of the deans of the whole medical school so.  He's always moving onward and upward.

PATIENT X514
Sort of DOCTOR.  Looks like @@@ about COPD @@@.

DOCTOR X514
Pardon me?

PATIENT X514
You heard the COPD a little more didn't you.

DOCTOR X514
So you can't really hear it more um.  You are wheezing a little and you can kind of hear when you cough that it's hard for you to get stuff up and that's from your COPD.  That'll probably never get better.  There's only two things that make people with COPD live longer.  One is oxygen if they need it, home oxygen when it gets bad and the other is quitting smoking so.  We can treat your symptoms with all of our medications but the only things that really work.

PATIENT X514
It's been a long time since I had a pulmonary test but uh you know.

DOCTOR X514
Yeah um I don't think we need to retest it and here's why.  All of the martial arts and stuff that you do, if you aren't complaining of shortness of breath then your COPD is controlled alright.

PATIENT X514
Okay so I have no problem.

DOCTOR X514
Yeah.  I think the best thing would be for you to quit smoking so.  The most you can do for that.  Have you seen the Smoking Cessation Clinic here?

PATIENT X514
I just don't do that stuff.

DOCTOR X514
Yeah.

PATIENT X514
I initiate it.  Even with hypnosis I'm good at it.  I don't want to do that anymore, I'm tired you know.

DOCTOR X514
Right.  It's just an option.

PATIENT X514
Most of the time when I smoke three or four cigarettes is because I'm on the computer and sit there and burn them and I look over and say I ain't got a cigarettes so I light another one and burn it rather than smoke it.

DOCTOR X514
Okay, alright.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X514
Thank you.

DOCTOR X514
Yep.

(DOCTOR OUT: 17:31  DOCTOR IN: 30:20)

PATIENT X514
You still have a year left right?

DOCTOR X514
I have just over two years left.

PATIENT X514
Good so.

DOCTOR X514
Yeah hopefully you should be able to see me every time you come in.

PATIENT X514
And what I was going to ask you was if you uh see any changes in my uh lab work, let me know up or down.

DOCTOR X514
I certainly will.

PATIENT X514
And if you know anything I can do to improve what I'm doing uh let me know and I'll jump right on it.

DOCTOR X514
So.

PATIENT X514
I need to ask you know.

DOCTOR X514
The um, the things to be concerned about right now are the diabetes and your kidneys.  So your glucose control is great, probably some of the best of any of my patients and the most important thing with the progression of diabetic kidney disease is blood pressure control.  Your blood pressure is very well controlled so I'm not concerned at all right now.

PATIENT X514
@@@.

DOCTOR X514
Your diabetic kidney disease will progress.  There's nothing we can do to stop it from progressing but you are, 64.

PATIENT X514
64 last June.

DOCTOR X514
In June.

PATIENT X514
Yep.

DOCTOR X514
This will likely progress slowly enough that you will die of something else before you know we need to do dialysis or something.

PATIENT X514
Well when I first found out, I had nobody in the family with diabetes so that's Agent Orange that.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X514
And it come up on a normal blood test and when I got home the Emergency Room called me and said you got a blood sugar level of 900 get in here, I don't know how you're even walking and I found out about it.  Well uh after I found that out I was able to you know I eat, whatever most people @@@ to what they eat, I just want it somewhere in the range, @@@.  Uh you know most people don't know that that's how they tell the deterioration of the kidneys is that flow change.

DOCTOR X514
Uh-huh.  Alright so you can come back and see me in four months.  We'll get your scope done in August and I don't think either of these appointments need to be scheduled today.  They'll send you the letter for both of them.

PATIENT X514
Later on.

DOCTOR X514
You should be getting a letter before too long for the optometrist.

PATIENT X514
Good, good, good.

DOCTOR X514
End of June is when you I think was when your last one was so you need to see them once a year so that'll be when your next one is.

PATIENT X514
Now let me, they do this @@@ from now.

DOCTOR X514
Right.

PATIENT X514
If the appointment is in for a year I have no idea when you're gonna have it.  I mean we got to change that.  Thank you so much.

DOCTOR X514
You're welcome.

PATIENT X514
You I'm really happy to be your patient.

DOCTOR X514
Thank you.  You're one of my favorite patients.  You're doing well under the circumstances.

PATIENT X514
Cause when I walk out this door, it ain't gonna happen you know.

DOCTOR X514
Let's hope it doesn't.

PATIENT X514
The ringing is only just for the minute they @@@.

DOCTOR X514
Take care sir.

PATIENT X514
This goes to the desk.

DOCTOR X514
Actually you don't have to take it to anyone because they'll mail you both of those.  You can only schedule appointments that are within the next 30 days at the desk so both of those will be scheduled and they'll mail you a letter.

PATIENT X514
They'll reschedule and send them to me.  Thank you very much.

DOCTOR X514
You're welcome, thank you.

PATIENT X514
Glad you gave me a copy of this, it's real precious.

DOCTOR X514
You're welcome.

PATIENT X514
Thank you.

DOCTOR X514
Yep, take care.

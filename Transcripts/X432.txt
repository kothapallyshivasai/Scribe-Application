It's just; we just want to get that blood pressure under better control, that's all it is.  It's one of those things you don't feel it when it's high but you know over time it can cause problems.

PATIENT X432
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X432
Okay.  So we'll start back that amlodipine again.  I think last month um the doctor you saw last month wanted to start that uh and I agree with it since the blood pressure's still high.  I think it would be a good thing to start that so, it's just a once a day small pill okay.

PATIENT X432
Okay.

DOCTOR X432
Is there anything else bothering you today?

PATIENT X432
No, the only problem that I really have that won't go away.  See I got arthritis and it was over here in my legs and never operate.  I always get pain @@@.  And that goes from right here all the way down to the ankle and that really bother me, came on @@@.

PATIENT X432
I do not.

DOCTOR X432
Okay.  Your bottle was empty.

PATIENT X432
Yeah.

DOCTOR X432
Okay.  So why don't we refill that when you go to the Pharmacy okay cause that really helps with the nerve pain.

PATIENT X432
Feel free to.

DOCTOR X432
Okay not a problem.

PATIENT X432
It bothers me night and day.

DOCTOR X432

PATIENT X432
And then one day they is cold.

DOCTOR X432

PATIENT X432
No no sore.

DOCTOR X432
Okay.

PATIENT X432

DOCTOR X432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X432
And one time they said they was too tight.

DOCTOR X432

DOCTOR X432
Yeah.  Do you see the Podiatry, the foot doctor?

PATIENT X432

DOCTOR X432

PATIENT X432
I check it.  The last time I checked it was the other day or later on Wednesday.  When I last checked it, it was on Monday morning.

DOCTOR X432
Okay.

PATIENT X432
Well what I mean I guess I can feel it if my sugars run a bit low or high.

DOCTOR X432
Okay.

PATIENT X432
And I put a little watch on that.

DOCTOR X432
Well your labs are showing the same thing, that your sugars have been pretty well controlled.

PATIENT X432

DOCTOR X432
So as long as you're staying in that range of around 100 to 120 in the mornings.

PATIENT X432

DOCTOR X432
Before you eat that's good.

PATIENT X432
They run around 132.

DOCTOR X432

DOCTOR X432
That's not too bad, we can work with that.  Okay.  I'm going to go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X432
Alright.  But you know the only thing, the only thing some big problem I got is some teeth.  They made three sets from here.

PATIENT X432
And they don't work out.  And you go to the doctor to get you a set @@@ and so but since it high.

DOCTOR X432

PATIENT X432
Don't cover it there.

DOCTOR X432

PATIENT X432
Yes.

DOCTOR X432

PATIENT X432
They used to having me going to surgery, I go to xxx and so when I got my leg broke on the bus they had the you know they @@@ until I got straightened out so when I got through, when I got through with that they had to call me back and start over here.  We'll just have to see where they go.

DOCTOR X432
Okay.  Okay.  Let me ask DOCTOR about the false teeth and check on those.

PATIENT X432
Uh I told DOCTOR about the teeth thing so she said well there wasn't too much she could do about it. 

DOCTOR X432
Yeah.

PATIENT X432
Told me to go down to the University on uh.

DOCTOR X432
Oh right, the dentist school at the University of Illinois.

PATIENT X432
University yeah.

DOCTOR X432
That's where we recommend people over there for dentistry actually.  A lot of times the VA doesn't cover very much dental work unless you're very service-connected and most people don't have that much service connection to cover all their dental work so there's a dental school down there that works at a pretty reasonable rate.

PATIENT X432
Oh I see.

DOCTOR X432
We can give you the information for that again today, want to try that?

PATIENT X432
I sure enough need it.  That's what I'm telling you, that's why I lost weight cause I haven't eaten.  I can't chew my food.

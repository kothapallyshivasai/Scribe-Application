PATIENT X93
I don't know @@@.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah standing but you @@@ in June I don't know is this right, in June of 2000 well you were 172.

PATIENT X93
When I came here, I came here in June.

DOCTOR X93
Cause you were working.

PATIENT X93
No I wasn't.  I came here from xxx xxx cause I was dying and they sent me for treatment.

DOCTOR X93
Here from alcohol.

PATIENT X93
Alcohol.

DOCTOR X93
Is that why your weight was so low cause you weren't eating?

PATIENT X93
Oh it was no.  I drink and I did not eat nothing for weeks.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah look at how much your weight went up.  Your weight went up from you were 172 and then you went up to 215 and then you kind of were stable so hopefully when you start working again your weight will come down.

PATIENT X93
Cause I need to work over there @@@.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah.

PATIENT X93
There are 25 acres.

DOCTOR X93
Well that's fantastic so I'm very happy that.  So how long can you stay in xxx xxx for?

PATIENT X93
Two years.

DOCTOR X93
Oh great so you have some time to get some money built up, get an apartment, two years.  Do you mind if I take a look at you?

PATIENT X93
Okay.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah let me take a peak.  I'm gonna wash my hands.  

PATIENT X93
Now I want to see, I don't know if it was you or the other doctor.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah.

PATIENT X93
Cause I have, my feet were sweating big time.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X93
And he said that was cause I was taking the high blood pressure pills and he gave me some water pills and they helped.

DOCTOR X93
I don't know how are your feet?

PATIENT X93
I take a few and I continue to @@@.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah.

PATIENT X93
And to be honest with you, he gave me like a 25 mg pill to have me take half pills.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah, right.

PATIENT X93
I've been taking the whole pill.

DOCTOR X93
Okay fine.

PATIENT X93
@@@.

DOCTOR X93
Well your blood pressure, it's not for your blood pressure control.  Your blood pressure's good.

PATIENT X93
Well the only thing that I am always concerned, being my concern is besides the high blood pressure is the @@@.

DOCTOR X93
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X93
I know, when I came to the states.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah.

PATIENT X93
I used to have 120, 145.

DOCTOR X93
So that can be due to the alcohol.  People that have alcohol they can go into withdrawals or when they're drinking can get heart rates that are fast and I know that you were drinking and not drinking and your body was probably.  Did you used to get the shakes a lot?

PATIENT X93
I know, it's gone.

DOCTOR X93
Okay.

PATIENT X93
But when you see me, when I came here uh.

DOCTOR X93
You were clean when I saw you in November.

PATIENT X93
I was.

DOCTOR X93
Yeah you told me.

PATIENT X93
I was clean from drugs.

DOCTOR X93
You told me you would drink a little bit in xxx xxx, that's why you left.

PATIENT X93
Uh that was bullshit, I was drinking lots.

DOCTOR X93
Oh I knew.  Don't worry, @@@ its okay.  Keep breathing.

PATIENT X93
As a matter of fact when you see me in the last time in November I was stop drinking for one day and I was shaking, my hand was shaking cause I was.

DOCTOR X93
Well I was trying to figure out why you left xxx xxx, you came all the way up here just to see me, I didn't think I was that important so I was trying to figure out why you came here and left your family and I know you say that you can get a better job here so I think that that's fantastic but I know also you said that.  You go to the bathroom okay?  Well you told me that if you stayed around xxx xxx you'd get in trouble.  You know you told me you were hanging out with the wrong guys and that.  

PATIENT X93
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X93
Your legs look good, they look real good.  There's no swelling at all.  Um so I think you're doing fantastic.  I'm very glad that uh you were able to get a job and you were able to get somewhere to live.  I applaud you for stopping alcohol and drugs.  I think that whatever you have to do to stay away from it do it.  I think that your health will get better as you start working more.  You will feel more motivated.  You'll have a real reason to get up in the morning and after a while you'll feel more empowered and you'll have more money and you can get an apartment and then you know hopefully you can get back with your family and get everything the way you want it again.

PATIENT X93
Yeah.  I'm applying for some job here in the hospital.

DOCTOR X93
Good.  Apply for everything you know we can do for you.

PATIENT X93
Yeah I get that job for @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X93
Hey anything, any extra money is helpful.  It'll help you get back on your feet and help you get out of here.  And just keep the colonoscopy appointment.  Uh I don't think we're gonna change any medications today and it looks like you have DOCTOR in May, early May he's gonna see you.  So let me go, I'll talk to my boss but I like the way everything's going.  I'm going to see you in the summer.

PATIENT X93

So what happened?

PATIENT X736
Well they never called me and he didn't get no appointment.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
I called out there, several times.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Because I figured that's what, see this numbness is still in my finger, both of them.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And uh I can live with that.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
But you know when it come to my prostate and the sleep apnea now that's something to be really concerned about.

DOCTOR X736
Okay what about the sleep apnea concerns you so much, tell me?

PATIENT X736
Because I uh, this new concern developing here now I wake up and I'll be coughing.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know not gasping for air.  I'm not short; you know I don't feel like I'm short of breath.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
But I spits up and stuff.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Now I'm laying awake.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know.

DOCTOR X736
Are you wearing the mask?

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
I just got a new one.  I get one every three months.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And uh but I'm having a problem.  Here is my problem with that mask, trying to make those adjustments with the straps.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Because I can't feel them.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
See, I can't feel it, you know some of them go like this and you put.  The one I got just come across here.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
I mean well except this one comes across like that.

DOCTOR X736
Is that one of the small ones.

PATIENT X736
Yeah the small one.

DOCTOR X736
Is that the one you're using?

PATIENT X736
And I had a full face one.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
When I first started.

DOCTOR X736
Oh okay.

PATIENT X736
But look like the rubber uh began to get soft.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know it wasn't fitting properly.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And by me with this numbness I can't make that adjustment with those straps.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
So I figured they might be coming out with something new.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
I got the newer type I think.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Right now.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.

PATIENT X736
But uh that's very important with that @@@, because my oxygen you know I don't get it.

DOCTOR X736
Right.

PATIENT X736
I'm getting it but.

DOCTOR X736
Right.  No it's great you're using it because if you have sleep apnea you have to use the mask.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Whether it's the nose mask or the face mask, you know this is fine, it works.

PATIENT X736
I sleep in it every night.

DOCTOR X736
It works very well.  Yeah uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
I put it on every night.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.

PATIENT X736
Because I had a lot of my friends, associates, they just laugh at it.  I don't want to get like that.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Which it may require their life to change.

DOCTOR X736
So you have to give it some time okay.  Give it some time of consistent use and it gets better.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
People say that once they start using it.

PATIENT X736
They don't want to stop.

DOCTOR X736
They don't want to stop.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
But it takes some time to get used to sleeping like that.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
See I get that feedback from those guys and that's where I want to be.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.  You will be, just give it some time cause it takes some time to make the every night adjustment.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
You know for the mask and for you to get comfortable with it.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
Uh what other concerns to you have of sleep apnea, regarding sleep apnea?

PATIENT X736
Well uh it was that my prostate like I said and I haven't had a complete physical.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Since my other doctor left.

DOCTOR X736
Okay what do you mean, what do you mean?

PATIENT X736
You know they check you for sugar and uh all that.

DOCTOR X736
For blood work yeah.  We had ordered some blood work.

PATIENT X736
I ain't had none of that I.

DOCTOR X736
No.

PATIENT X736
I ain't had nothing like that and that's what you know uh, I don't think the prostate test maybe twice a year or something maybe or once.

DOCTOR X736
Okay so in February we had ordered some blood tests the routine physical tests.  You know things that we check every year; you know cholesterol and prostate number and things like that um.

PATIENT X736
But I never got the results.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah well I don't think it was drawn cause it's still pending it says so maybe today after this appointment.  Have you eaten anything this morning?

PATIENT X736

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  So you can just go to the Lab and get all these blood tests done.

PATIENT X736
Please I be glad to get that.

DOCTOR X736

PATIENT X736
Yeah.  You think they could check me for sugar?

DOCTOR X736

PATIENT X736

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736

Cause I have a tremendous appetite.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736

PATIENT X736
You know I take that tablet that you give me uh, that little brown round one.

DOCTOR X736

DOCTOR X736
Oh no you're not.  You're doing everything right.  The only couple of things I need you to do is follow up with the neurosurgeon.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Because you have pretty bad arthritis in your neck.

PATIENT X736
Yeah I do.

DOCTOR X736
Impinging on some of the nerves okay.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
I don't know if the shaking is because of that.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
So I think that Neurology had seen you and they wanted you to go see the neurosurgeons and just talk to them.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
It doesn't mean you're committed to surgery.  You talk to them and find out what they have to offer.

PATIENT X736
That's what I will do.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.  So that's at the xxx VA okay.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
The other thing um and you need to go back and see the neurologist.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Not the urologist, not the prostate doctors, the neurologist.  He is the doctor that actually initially referred you to xxx okay.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
But this time we need to talk to them about the balance and also the shaking and see if they have anything else to offer okay.

PATIENT X736
Okay.

DOCTOR X736
Um we'll check some of the lab work um and let me talk to DOCTOR and see what we can do about sleeping.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
If there's anything else okay.

PATIENT X736
Yeah well she knows me, but I'm saying cause she and I talk and uh I'm just concerned.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Doctor you know about me, you know I know I'm getting old but I'll do what I have to do.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736

DOCTOR X736

PATIENT X736

You know at my age what am I gonna do about it.

DOCTOR X736

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

Um let's see some of the ways we can help you.  So I want you to know I hear your concerns.  I understand if you're not sleeping well then other things affect it.

PATIENT X736
Yeah that really bother me that sleep.  And those tablets that I have those supposed to make me rest a little better?

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
But I ain't got no more.

DOCTOR X736
When you had them were you taking them?

PATIENT X736
Well um not consistently uh.  She didn't, when they give them to me it was something just to aid, it wasn't nothing I don't think, they didn't tell me to continuously take them.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
But I know I'm out of them and uh it wasn't a harsh type of a tablet that would put you into a deep sleep or nothing like that.

DOCTOR X736
Uh uh.

PATIENT X736
And uh and I but I just want, if I could just go to you know get numb you know.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And I feel the sleep coming on.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
That's when I say my prayers cause I know when I get through saying my prayers I should be.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know ready cause I love to sleep.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
I really do.  I put all those years in the steel mill but that's all I did.  I worked, come home, ate, went to bed you know something like that but it was a pattern and everything was normal then.  You know you regular things happened, you went to work, you stayed eight hours and come home uh did some stuff you know and then you eat your supper.

DOCTOR X736
When did you stop working?

PATIENT X736
Uh I been retired now about three years.

DOCTOR X736
Three okay.

PATIENT X736
But I put 30 years in the steel mill.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know and then uh I worked awfully hard.  I been working 50 years.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.  Long time huh.

PATIENT X736
Yeah 50 years I been, you know I worked.

DOCTOR X736
Now um when did the sleep problem start for you the first time?

PATIENT X736
The sleep problem started actually a couple years ago doc.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Really but it didn't bother me then because I just thought I had a couple of cools too much or something and uh and I'd fallen asleep and then I got you know drink beers sometimes on Friday evening.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Then uh I'd get into bed but I'd wake right up.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
So.

DOCTOR X736
How much do you drink now?

PATIENT X736
Well uh, see like I not today like I said like Fridays, you go to a retirement party or something; I drink three cans of beer.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And then a shot or two of champagne.  Not regularly, I mean this ain't nothing you know.  I'm not a regular drinker now.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know and usually when I drink beer is with I'm gonna be with someone.

DOCTOR X736
So on average how much do you drink every day?

PATIENT X736
Nothing.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
Water is more, that's what I drink.  See I have to have a taste for it.  You have to have a taste for certain things.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.

PATIENT X736
I don't have a taste, but like a person that smoke they have a taste for that cigarette, but I ain't got the taste for that alcohol.  I never drank no Jack Daniels or stuff like that.

DOCTOR X736
So when you drink, maybe you drink once or twice a week, something like that?

PATIENT X736
I'm gonna say three.

DOCTOR X736
Three times a week.

PATIENT X736
I'll say that, but that's not.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
And about three cans of beer on each.

DOCTOR X736
Each time.

PATIENT X736
Yeah because I'm gonna to a funeral this Thursday.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And after he passed they brought me up here.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
After the meal you know.  But I have to have that; I have to develop that taste.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
@@@ you know, so I'm not concerned about drinking but if I do I know just I'd better go with it.

DOCTOR X736
How about smoking, do you smoke?

PATIENT X736
Never smoked.

DOCTOR X736
No okay and any drug use?

PATIENT X736
Huh?

DOCTOR X736
Any drug use?

PATIENT X736
No.  I have smoked some weed.

DOCTOR X736
In the past or?

PATIENT X736
Uh about a year, about half a year, something like that.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
You know uh at a retirement party, uh and I @@@ when I was 76 but you know it doesn't bother me none, I don't guess.  Now I worry about this kicker, but that was just the weed so, that was it.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  And so just the one time you tried it.

PATIENT X736
Oh no it's more than that but I'd say once a month.

DOCTOR X736
Okay and you're still smoking once a month?

PATIENT X736
Yeah not regularly but I mean it'll balance out in a year's time.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
Maybe once a month.

DOCTOR X736
Okay so occasionally.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X736
And it ain't nothing I can't quit.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
Cause if you tell me @@@ I'd say that's it.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
You see it's like that.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
With me, nothing I can do I can't stop because I'm concerned about my health.

DOCTOR X736
Let me ask you this, what's keeping you from stopping?

PATIENT X736
Huh?

DOCTOR X736
What's keeping you from stopping?

PATIENT X736
Nothing.

DOCTOR X736
Nothing, okay.

PATIENT X736
Uh uh, nothing.

DOCTOR X736
I just you know marijuana is illegal.  I'm sure if it helps you a whole lot.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
Um so you might as well stop right?

PATIENT X736
I can stop right now.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.

PATIENT X736
Ain't no big deal.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.

PATIENT X736
Who cares about it, it ain't that I got to have it.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.  So I think.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
You smoke it once in a while like that.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Okay hmm.

PATIENT X736
It's that heavy stuff, crack and all that is what.  I don't even go on that one but I'm concerned and you know I haven't done that since the Army.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.

PATIENT X736
And uh occasionally you know when I was young and stuff but I never started and then you hear rumors that you know you smoke a little pot and it'll help your eyesight and this and that and got me wearing glasses so you know.

DOCTOR X736
It helps, you know in California it's legalized.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
For glaucoma.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
But I didn't see over here that you have documented glaucoma.

PATIENT X736
No.

DOCTOR X736
It doesn't help vision as such.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
But if somebody has glaucoma then it can help the glaucoma.

PATIENT X736
But uh I don't have to have it.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And I don't look for it.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Or nothing like that uh and that's not a whole donut.  I'm talking about maybe three or four kilos.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  Okay, alright.

PATIENT X736
You know.

DOCTOR X736
Now let me ask you about your heart a little bit more.  When you walk around, let say if you walk a flight of stairs or walk a couple blocks do you feel any pain?

PATIENT X736
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X736
No okay.

PATIENT X736
See when I work out in my gym on the treadmill.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And stuff you know I don't feel tired, sometimes I work up a sweat but I gauge myself.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And the personal trainer she's right there.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.  And you don't feel any heart racing.

PATIENT X736
Palpitating no.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  Pain?

PATIENT X736
No.

DOCTOR X736
Pressure in your chest?  No.

PATIENT X736
No.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  Any um, I know you sweat because you're working out.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
But what about just going up a flight of stairs and something do you feel like.

PATIENT X736
No sweat.  No sweating or nothing.  The only thing right now probably going up my steps now and coming down them I hurt in my legs.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know right in here.  You know I got varicose veins true enough uh if I'm carrying something I do feel kind of weak in the legs I go you know but this wasn't nothing compared to this.  Sometimes you know my sleep apnea but um my balance, like I say when I talked to him or whatever I was gonna discuss that with him.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
But uh that's about it.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
You know uh I don't have no problem eating uh something like I don't have to have coffee.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Uh but I will drink a cup of tea or something uh.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Every night in the evening because in my class they told me don't drink nothing with caffeine after six.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Stuff like that, I follow the rules.

DOCTOR X736
You follow everything okay, excellent.  

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
So that's all of your concerns okay.  So like I said see I have to talk to DOCTOR and see what other ideas we can come up with.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
So maybe you should try that medication again, the trazodone, to see if that might help you.  You have to take it before you go to bed.

PATIENT X736
Yeah and you want me to take that every night?

DOCTOR X736
Yeah uh-huh.  Let me talk to DOCTOR.

PATIENT X736
Yeah, you just tell her, well she's honest with me and all that.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah, sure, absolutely, absolutely.

PATIENT X736
I know she's concerned.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
About me and my health but I think if I could sleep.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
I'd be a much better person if I could sleep.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
We're gonna try to help you with sleep okay.

PATIENT X736
Okay.

DOCTOR X736
And your sleep apnea, you're using the machine.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Give it some time and you'll get used to it okay.

PATIENT X736
Okay.

DOCTOR X736
And then we'll see how things go.

PATIENT X736
Okay.  Now.

DOCTOR X736
Uh.

PATIENT X736
Can I bring, I can bring that, now cause see I want to make, no one ever fitted that mask on me.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Now the matter with me I can't grasp those straps.  This new mask they give me.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Well she adjusted it up there but I puts it on intact.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And pull it down.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know and then it rests right here.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
So I can do it like that.

DOCTOR X736
Can somebody help you with the mask?

PATIENT X736
Yeah my wife, when she's there.

DOCTOR X736
If it's hard to put it on.

PATIENT X736
It's hard by myself.

DOCTOR X736
Then you can put it on like this and strap it around.

PATIENT X736
See if I put, leave that one strap open.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And then you know.

DOCTOR X736
Just put it on.

PATIENT X736
Yeah and then use that one strap.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Kind of like this new type I got there's two straps.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
For this one.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know.

DOCTOR X736
Now do you go to the Equipment Clinic?

PATIENT X736
No that's where I got it from here.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
But nobody showed, she showed me this last time the one that I got but when I went to the class I spent the night out here for observation and they found out that I stopped breathing a couple of times and all that good stuff so after I went to pick up the equipment no one showed me how to put that thing on.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
The mask.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
And the lady who did I didn't understand her English.  She didn't, I couldn't understand what she was saying.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
So I was just stuck with something.

DOCTOR X736
Where was that lady?  Was she in the clinic?

PATIENT X736
She was in the, she was issuing the equipment.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  So maybe we need to go back with them.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
Uh cause they're the ones who would do the adjustment for you.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Okay so why don't you bring your mask back, go back to them and maybe speak with someone else.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Not that person.

PATIENT X736
Because see I, just like this behind me.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
The head, you see mine comes across the forehead.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Too.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
But my hose and that is the one that comes across the forehead.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And I love that one.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
You know but I'm getting it balled up behind the head back here.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And I think it's the thing just behind the head.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Now this one could fit if I could get mine to do that.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
You know.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah, yeah, no they can help you.  That's just the adjustment that needs to happen okay.

PATIENT X736
Yeah but sometimes.

DOCTOR X736
Just give it a little bit of time to come up with the mask that's appropriate for you.

PATIENT X736
Cause sometimes in the night you know you toss and turn and that hose and the straps twist and it's a mess.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh, yeah it's uncomfortable.

PATIENT X736
But the mask you know I think I'm getting a good enough fit during the night.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
Because I could see the water in my machine is breathing.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
And my little calendar that's a data sheet I check it.  I got to find out when I was supposed to bring it back here in three months.

DOCTOR X736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X736
So they can tell if it's effective or something like that.

DOCTOR X736
Find out yeah.

PATIENT X736
So I'm gonna do that uh when I come back.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.

PATIENT X736
I want to change here.

DOCTOR X736
So we'll work on getting that mask fitted to you appropriately and I think that'll help you sleep also.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  As far as your prostate is concerned, you know your prostate number was checked recently, within the year and it looked okay.  You didn't tell me very significant urinary complaints but we can have you see the urologist again.

PATIENT X736
Yeah.

DOCTOR X736
Do you want to doctors?

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
And then we'll take it from there.  What we'll do today is check your urine.  Okay one more time just make sure there's no blood in it.

PATIENT X736
Okay, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
And then you talked about your heart.  You know the symptoms you're telling me it seems like you have a good heart that's working pretty good okay.  Um maybe it is related to not sleeping very well with the sleep apnea symptoms okay.  Right now I'm gonna keep an eye on that.

PATIENT X736
Okay.

DOCTOR X736
Okay.  Um and then we talked about constipation.  Constipation you're gonna continue using the tablet that you're taking.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X736
The Docusate, continue eating all the foods that you are eating cause all that helps keep your stools softened you know so you can move your bowel.

PATIENT X736
Uh-huh.  I do eat a lot of yogurt too.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah uh-huh.  Alright.  Is that everything?

PATIENT X736
That's about it uh you know because I'm gonna get these tests you see, the blood work that'll tell you some stuff and I'm just concerned about my prostate but if I can, if I can sleep.

DOCTOR X736
Everything would be better.

PATIENT X736
Four full hours, three hours or four of good sleep I'd be a better person.

DOCTOR X736
Right.

PATIENT X736
I just be irritable and crabby in the morning when they.

DOCTOR X736
Yeah.

PATIENT X736
You know.

DOCTOR X736

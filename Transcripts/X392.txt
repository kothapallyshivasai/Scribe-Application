@@@.

DOCTOR X392
Um you know its okay.  I mean it's something, whether is that something you'd want to get to protect you from shingles?  Cause we could give you a shot the next time you come.  I think it we would have to get it approved and then they would give it to him next time.

PATIENT X392
Okay.

DOCTOR X392
Yeah we can give it to him next time but you'd only give it to you if you had chicken pox in the past.

SECOND PERSON X392
For the shingles ages 65 right.

DOCTOR X392
For the shingles, if he had chicken pox.

SECOND PERSON X392
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X392
This shot will prevent him from getting the shingles.

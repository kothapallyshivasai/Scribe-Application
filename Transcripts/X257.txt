DOCTOR X257
You saw them.

PATIENT X257
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X257
Two weeks ago?

PATIENT X257
Oh yeah, yeah I'm well cared for uh I had a colectomy back in June and was given uh two months of chemo.

DOCTOR X257
@@@.

PATIENT X257
That.

DOCTOR X257
Didn't go too well.

PATIENT X257
Darn near killed me.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
I didn't want to live that way uh and you know I outlasted it and I feel great and I'm only concerned with a return of the cancer and I have a colonoscopy scheduled.

DOCTOR X257
Right.

PATIENT X257
So it's under control.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.  You could not, so how's your appetite been though?

PATIENT X257
Uh good yes, very good.  And my alimentary canal, as far as I can tell is functioning very well considering I lost a third of the colon.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.  So otherwise you think you're doing fine?

PATIENT X257
Yes.  Thanks to you good folks at xxx and my wife.

DOCTOR X257

PATIENT X257
No.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

DOCTOR X257
Coughing up anything?

No.  I have a persistent cough that I think is indicative of nothing other than bad habits.

DOCTOR X257
Shortness of breath?

PATIENT X257
No.  I'm back on my bicycle and trying to get my conditioning back.

DOCTOR X257
So any symptoms of your heart?

PATIENT X257
No.

DOCTOR X257
Cause I know you had a procedure where they ablated.

PATIENT X257
Yes, yeah.  Well I didn't know I needed an ablation.

DOCTOR X257

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
But it's gone.

DOCTOR X257
You're having regular bowel movements daily?

PATIENT X257
Uh just about.  Yeah for all practical purposes I'm very regular.

DOCTOR X257
Not any, has it been loose or constipation?

PATIENT X257
Uh that concerns me.  It was uh not loose at all and suddenly it became much softer.

DOCTOR X257
When?

About six weeks ago and I have observed it and there seems to be nothing irregular.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

DOCTOR X257
Are you taking the, this is your blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT X257
No.

DOCTOR X257
You're not.  I thought they told you to take it.  Remember when Cardiology saw you, you were taking 10 of it and they wanted you to decrease to 5.

PATIENT X257
Oh wait a minute, no I take half a pill for cholesterol every night but that's not it, that's not it no.  No that's.  You know I'm not taking this and uh I think it's my negligence.  

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
Uh I need to uh.

DOCTOR X257
Let's see if there are any other ones that you're not taking.

PATIENT X257
Start it.

DOCTOR X257
You take a stool softener?

PATIENT X257
No I don't need it.

DOCTOR X257
This is probably before.  You're to take it before your colonoscopy.

PATIENT X257
Yeah.

DOCTOR X257
Yeah.

PATIENT X257
Probably yeah.

DOCTOR X257
Do you take this one?

PATIENT X257
Uh.

DOCTOR X257
It's a stool softener too.

PATIENT X257
No, no.

DOCTOR X257
It's to keep you more regular, no.

PATIENT X257
No and I don't feel I need it.

DOCTOR X257
Do you use eye drops?

DOCTOR X257
@@@.  So you're taking half a pill of this for your cholesterol.

PATIENT X257
Yes.

DOCTOR X257
So you're not taking lisinopril either.

PATIENT X257
No.

DOCTOR X257
And you're not taking any blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT X257
No.

DOCTOR X257
So DOCTOR, who saw you a couple of weeks ago.

PATIENT X257
No, well he.

DOCTOR X257
Told you to restart those medicines but you're not.

PATIENT X257
Now wait a minute DOCTOR?

DOCTOR X257
Yeah.

PATIENT X257

DOCTOR X257
You don't recall him telling you that?

PATIENT X257
No.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
Which is not to say he didn't.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
But I, you know, I need to okay uh.

DOCTOR X257
You're taking baby aspirin right?

PATIENT X257
Nope.

DOCTOR X257
Why not?

PATIENT X257
Uh, a combination of forgetfulness and negligence.  I have to take the blame for that because if I was @@@ to take it.

DOCTOR X257
Do you have the pills at home?

PATIENT X257
Yeah oh right.

DOCTOR X257
Do you have like the.

PATIENT X257
The baby aspirin?

PATIENT X257
No.  Now I need to.

DOCTOR X257

DOCTOR X257
You're taking lisinopril.

PATIENT X257
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X257

So I should be taking that stuff.  I'm seeing DOCTOR, cardiologist after this appointment.

DOCTOR X257
Uh-huh.  @@@.

PATIENT X257
Sure.

DOCTOR X257
And I think the reason why the plan @@@ for you to keep up on these medicines was to cut back on these medicines.

PATIENT X257
Uh.

DOCTOR X257
Was because during the time when you had the weight loss your blood pressure was low, you @@@.  It looks like things are much better now.

PATIENT X257
Yes.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.  Alright I need to just fill out; okay we have a series of questions the VA wants us to ask you guys okay?

PATIENT X257
Oh I'm at your disposal with great appreciation.

DOCTOR X257

DOCTOR X257
Are you fairly active at home like walking around, do you do all the walking yourself or?

PATIENT X257
No, but I do quite a bit and the only problem is that I am not regular enough but every once in a while I take a long bike ride which I really enjoy and then I sleep better.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
At night.

DOCTOR X257
Do you do your cooking at home?

PATIENT X257
My wife does, my wife.

DOCTOR X257
Uh-huh.  Are you up walking around all the time?

DOCTOR X257
You're eating like three meals a day?

PATIENT X257
Oh yes, very very good meals.

DOCTOR X257

PATIENT X257
Not enough.  As a matter of fact I'm looking for work because I was off and uh @@@.

DOCTOR X257
Hmm.

PATIENT X257
Uh but I still am rather sedentary and I get up and my back is stiff.  But that's being 79 I presume.

DOCTOR X257

Finally right?

DOCTOR X257
Oh really.  Alright so we'll give you 10 of that.  You can pick that up downstairs too.

PATIENT X257
Oh boy.  So three things.

DOCTOR X257

So you're to pick up your two medicines, your three medicines.

PATIENT X257
Yes.

DOCTOR X257
Two for your blood pressure.

PATIENT X257
Uh-huh and the ear wax.

DOCTOR X257
And the one for the ear wax.

PATIENT X257
Yeah.

DOCTOR X257
And we'll do your cholesterol check when you come back.

PATIENT X257
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X257
When you go to Podiatry.

PATIENT X257
Podiatry, I'll stop at the blood lab.

DOCTOR X257
Any questions for me at all?

PATIENT X257
Yes uh, every month.

DOCTOR X257
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X257
Or more often I have a Port-A-Cath flushed.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
Up on 9 East.

DOCTOR X257
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X257
Would it be simpler to have the cholesterol check as part of that or be more complicated?

DOCTOR X257
You could do it during that time but the thing is I'm not sure if they'll have the labels printed out for their labs.

PATIENT X257
Oh you want to do it.

DOCTOR X257
It doesn't matter as long as it's drawn.  So what we could do is.

PATIENT X257
Cause I'll be glad to do it when I come in for my podiatry.

DOCTOR X257
Well you could do it when you get the Port-A-Cath done.

PATIENT X257
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X257
When you get it flushed, ask them whether they can do your labs.

PATIENT X257
Okay for cholesterol.

DOCTOR X257
For your cholesterol.

PATIENT X257
Yes.

DOCTOR X257
If they cannot then you'll have to go see downstairs.  The main reason is I'm not sure where those labels print out from.

PATIENT X257
Uh-huh no.

DOCTOR X257
Should the labels.

PATIENT X257
Well I don't want to complicate things.

DOCTOR X257
If they don't print out, just ask them.

PATIENT X257
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X257
If they don't have the labels then you get it done downstairs.

PATIENT X257
Okay.

DOCTOR X257
Or if they can regenerate the label then it's perfectly fine.

PATIENT X257
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X257
As long as the lab is done there.

PATIENT X257
Okay.

DOCTOR X257
Okay.

PATIENT X257
Yeah.

DOCTOR X257
So take your amlodipine, take your lisinopril.

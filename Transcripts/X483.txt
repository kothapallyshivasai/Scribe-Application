DOCTOR X483
PATIENT?
 
PATIENT X483
Yes.

DOCTOR X483
How's it going?  I'm DOCTOR.  You got your reports?

PATIENT X483
Yeah shall we take a look at the EKG?

DOCTOR X483
When did you get an EKG?

PATIENT X483
Uh three weeks ago.

DOCTOR X483
Why'd you get an EKG?  Did I order that or?

PATIENT X483
Uh no another doctor ordered it uh.  I had uh; well I had a period of shortness of breath.  I'm on the Agent Orange Registry and I said I'd better get an EKG to check for ischemia cause I know that came up on me.

DOCTOR X483
You're on the what registry?

PATIENT X483
The Agent Orange Registry.

DOCTOR X483
Oh okay.

PATIENT X483
And that's a result, I was exposed to it.  I said we better check that and that EKG showed ischemia and it was very irregular and we kind of.

DOCTOR X483
Do you have chest pain?

PATIENT X483
Uh no but I know I get dizzy once in a while.  That could be from the blood pressure going up sometimes.  I got, see when I first started coming here my pressure was way up, now you got it under control but uh I been.

DOCTOR X483
So you got the chest x-rays because you're short of breath?

PATIENT X483
Uh the EKG?

DOCTOR X483
Yeah EKG.

PATIENT X483
Yeah I was concerned because it came up on me @@@ before the Agent Orange.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.

PATIENT X483
And it came up on the registry and of course I have high blood pressure so you know.

DOCTOR X483
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X483
From Vietnam so I was a little concerned about that so we said we better get an EKG.

DOCTOR X483
And what symptoms were you having?  You were feeling short of breath when you walked or just when you were resting?

PATIENT X483
Uh when I walk.

DOCTOR X483
When you walk and how long had that been going on?

PATIENT X483
Uh it's just off and on.

DOCTOR X483
How many blocks can you walk before you get short of breath or how many flights of stairs can you walk before you get short of breath?

PATIENT X483
Uh I can maybe go at least a flight.

DOCTOR X483
Is that new or old?  Has that always been the case for a while or is that like that's been here less than a week?

PATIENT X483
No it's been like this for quite a while.

DOCTOR X483
Quite a while of years?

PATIENT X483
Well uh you know since Vietnam.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  So your shortness of breath when you exert yourself is not new wouldn't you say?

PATIENT X483
No, no it's not @@@.

DOCTOR X483
So uh what did it get worst that made you say or did you just see the registry and like hey I better get my.

PATIENT X483
Oh yeah, that's basically what I did, yeah that's why I started taking a look.

DOCTOR X483
So I'm taking a look at it now.  Let me just print it out, let's see here.

PATIENT X483
And I talked to the nurse.  She said it's probably the dizziness.  I need to quit smoking.  I've tried to quit smoking 20 times and the problem when I smoke it runs my pressure up and that probably what makes me dizzy once in a while so.  It's not all the time.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah I.

PATIENT X483
So I got to quit smoking I know that.

DOCTOR X483
The best thing you can do for yourself is to quit smoking.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
How are you doing at that?

PATIENT X483
I cut it down.

DOCTOR X483
Well you were up to a pack a day the last time I saw you.

PATIENT X483
Yeah I'm at a half now.

DOCTOR X483
At half pack a day.

PATIENT X483
Yeah and if I could get it.

DOCTOR X483
You go to the Smoking Cessation Clinic?  They can help.

PATIENT X483
Yeah I'm trying to do it on my own.

DOCTOR X483
Trying to do it on your own?

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
If it don't work then I'll go to the clinic.

DOCTOR X483
Cause on Monday you don't need an appointment you just walked in.

PATIENT X483
You mean right here?

DOCTOR X483
Yeah no appointment.

PATIENT X483
Well I.

DOCTOR X483
Do you want me to give you the information to you?

PATIENT X483
Yeah, yeah I'll come up.

DOCTOR X483
You walk in, you don't need an appointment but the one on Monday they'll give you gums, patches.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
And the other one on Wednesdays is more like a group thing, kind of like working through a group thing but you can't get any of the gums or patches on that one.

PATIENT X483
But I can just walk in on Monday?

DOCTOR X483
You can just walk in.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Let me give you the information.

PATIENT X483
I've cut it down but I need to quit.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah that would definitely be the best thing you can do for your health.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Is to prevent cancer, you get lung cancer you know with smoking.  You increase your chances like 10 times and you can increase your chance of getting a heart attack or a stroke by multiple times by smoking so a lot of risk factors with the smoking definitely uh, you know.

PATIENT X483
Now I have the ischemia what was my concern, my family that cuts 
down on you, that means you're not getting oxygen to some part of your heart.  @@@.

DOCTOR X483
Ischemia just means like a heart attack.  In medical terms they call it a myocardial ischemia.

PATIENT X483
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X483
That just means you know the heart's not getting oxygen like you said.

PATIENT X483
Right.

DOCTOR X483
When your tissues don't get oxygen they start dying.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
So when your heart muscle starts dying, okay that's what we call a heart attack and obviously.

PATIENT X483
Your @@@.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.  So you get a lot of other problems besides that and the heart can sometimes recover but it can never recover fully and that's when people get what we call congestive heart failure with the heart not pumping as much as it can and they get you know a lot more deconditioned and they can't you know you may know people who can walk from this end of the room to that end of the room without ever getting short of breath.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
You know they're probably not able so that's what I'm saying like that's what happens.

PATIENT X483
Can I, can I improve on that maybe by a treadmill or something like that?  Would that help it?

DOCTOR X483
Diet, exercise, weight loss, cutting out smoking, controlling your blood pressure all those things will prevent.  These have all been studied, widely studied right and they look at people and they say what we should do, what can we do to prevent heart attacks and the thing they found is you know controlling your blood pressure.

PATIENT X483
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X483
Have your pressure in good control.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.  Quit smoking.  I got to quit smoking.

DOCTOR X483
You know controlling your cholesterol, cause cholesterol can cause heart attacks.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  Quitting smoking okay.  Age, you can't change that.  Genetics, you can't change that.

PATIENT X483
But how can Agent Orange cause that?

DOCTOR X483
Agent Orange?

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Uh.

PATIENT X483
They told me that's related?

DOCTOR X483
Uh I don't know, I actually have to look into Agent Orange, I'm not an expert on Agent Orange.

PATIENT X483
Okay.  I'm know I'm on the registry.

DOCTOR X483
But Agent Orange, so I know there are some lung uh and there's some uh.

PATIENT X483
They said high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X483
There's some cancers that can be related to Agent Orange.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Uh @@@.

PATIENT X483
Yeah right.  See I'm on the registry and there was another thing that ischemia came up on the list as one of them.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah, on the list as one of them okay.

PATIENT X483
@@@ and the description said Agent Orange you know can cause it.

DOCTOR X483
So the Urology Clinic people they're following your PSAs?

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Oh you saw them in March.

PATIENT X483
Yes he's following that.

DOCTOR X483
And we'll work on that.  How's the, your blood pressure medicines you're still taking all of them?

PATIENT X483
I been taking all of them.  Uh they told me if I could start working out maybe we can eliminate one but right now I'm taking all of them.  But it's keeping my pressure down.

DOCTOR X483
You're taking metoprolol and you're taking the hydrochlorothiazide and Losartan all those pills?

PATIENT X483
Right, yes.

DOCTOR X483
And you're taking the amlodipine?

PATIENT X483
Yes.

DOCTOR X483
Alright um yes and then you remember a low salt diet cause a low salt diet will help prevent you know, you from getting high blood pressure as well.  Um.

PATIENT X483
@@@.

DOCTOR X483
How's your mood been doing?  Do you still follow with the psychiatrist and everything?

PATIENT X483
Yeah my PTSD is getting worse.  I haven't worked in eight months.  

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.

PATIENT X483
Uh I'm under a lot of stress and like I said when I heard about this ischemia with my heart it made me worse cause you know I hadn't been sleeping but the doctor did give me some, I got some, I came in and got some pills for the stress.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
I get too, a little bit too upset but uh that's why I'm trying to work on everything.  I mean I'm on the internet and you know my family's working with me.

DOCTOR X483
No chest pain, no pressure, no palpitations um?

PATIENT X483
No.

DOCTOR X483
And no shortness of breath at rest and you have a little bit of dyspnea on the, a little bit of shortness of breath when you move.

PATIENT X483
When I exert myself.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X483
I think maybe that's from not being, not working out.

DOCTOR X483
Any of those night sweats any more or fevers or chills at night?

PATIENT X483
I still get night sweats.

DOCTOR X483
You still get night sweats?

PATIENT X483
Yes.

DOCTOR X483
And it is, uh how long have you had your night sweats for?

PATIENT X483
Since Vietnam.  I wake up.

DOCTOR X483
Vietnam.

PATIENT X483
I sleep maybe two hours then I can't sleep.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.  I know we had tried a new sleep aid on you right.  Didn't Psychiatry give you a new prescription?

PATIENT X483
I tried that.

DOCTOR X483
Is that helping or not helping anymore?

PATIENT X483
It did help because uh.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.

PATIENT X483
Before I was trying to drink beer to go to sleep.  I don't like alcohol.

DOCTOR X483
You're not drinking anymore right?

PATIENT X483
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR X483
Good.

PATIENT X483
The pills eliminated that so.

DOCTOR X483
Good.

PATIENT X483
It helps.

DOCTOR X483
Alright.  So you're still getting the night sweats a little bit.

PATIENT X483
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X483
But you think it may be related to PTSD?

PATIENT X483
I know it is.

DOCTOR X483
Okay we sent a bunch of tests off.  Those were all negative.  Just to let you know the hepatitis B, C, thyroid and it was normal.  Your blood tests look good.

PATIENT X483
Great.

DOCTOR X483
And that's all you know good news.

PATIENT X483
And those sweats all from PTSD yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.

PATIENT X483
That's something I'm have to live with.

DOCTOR X483
You get any chest pain when you exert yourself or just the shortness of breath?

PATIENT X483
Just a little shortness of breath that's all.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  And besides having this do you ever pass out?

PATIENT X483
No, no, no.  I just get a little dizzy. 

DOCTOR X483
You know is it dizzy when you stand up, like is it positional or is it even if you're laying in bed you can get this dizziness.

PATIENT X483
Uh usually standing up.

DOCTOR X483
When you're standing up.

PATIENT X483
Uh yeah you know what it is like @@@ I was in the Marine Corps.

DOCTOR X483
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X483
If you smoke.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.

PATIENT X483
And during basic training I only smoked two cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR X483
Right.

PATIENT X483
Because by not smoking regular and stuff like that, you know when you smoke a cigarette you get dizzy.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.

PATIENT X483
That's what kind of dizziness I get.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
So I say well maybe that's from smoking cigarettes.

DOCTOR X483
@@@.

PATIENT X483
Yeah that's the same dizziness I got when I was in boot camp.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.

PATIENT X483
Cause I was only smoking two cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.  @@@ deep breath in and out.  Again.  Good, again.  Good again.  Good again.  @@@.  Okay.  Do you need refills on medications today?

PATIENT X483
Uh no I think I'm okay right now.  So they did an EKG, that's something I should be really concerned about?

DOCTOR X483
Yeah I'm gonna take a look at it.

PATIENT X483
Oh, oh you @@@.

DOCTOR X483
It's in the computer but it's easier to look at uh, easier to look at it on paper.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.  All of a sudden my wife is scared to death when she saw it.  I had a copy of it and I said let me talk to the doctor.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah I'm gonna take a look at it right now.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:03  DOCTOR IN:  49:19)

DOCTOR X483
Let me get that for you.

PATIENT X483
Let me ask you something, does the high blood pressure make you sleepy all the time, a lot?

DOCTOR X483
No it shouldn't.

PATIENT X483
Cause I'm sitting up watching TV and a lot of times I get sleepy and my wife thought maybe it was the high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X483
Uh no.  Blood pressures, high blood pressures don't make you sleepy.

PATIENT X483
That's fine, it's probably.

DOCTOR X483
Sometimes medicines can do that.

PATIENT X483
It's just not sleeping at night.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
Well that's been since Vietnam.

DOCTOR X483
Have a seat up here.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:51  DOCTOR IN: 60:32)

DOCTOR X483
Alright.  @@@ no appointment needed.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
You can just walk in any time to get this.

PATIENT X483
Good.

DOCTOR X483
Alright.

PATIENT X483
How'd that EKG look to you?

DOCTOR X483
Well the EKG you got, yeah so these waves right here that are outside.

PATIENT X483
The inverted T waves.

DOCTOR X483
The waves that are going up.

PATIENT X483
An inverted T wave right.

DOCTOR X483
Inverted T waves.

PATIENT X483
T wave, yeah Q, R, S and T yeah.

DOCTOR X483
If they're reading up or someone's been telling you?

PATIENT X483
My wife just thought the emphasis.

DOCTOR X483
Okay yeah.

PATIENT X483
And she say yeah it looks like ischemia but I said let me talk to the doctor.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah.  So you have inverted T waves.  These are nonspecific, it means that it's, you know if we could say wow this means that you have, that you're having a heart attack.  Right or sometimes you're having, this could mean that people would have had like prior, maybe some damage to the heart.

PATIENT X483
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X483
They will have it and other times people will be normal and they'll have this.

PATIENT X483
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay so it's not specific.  It's not necessarily but you do have some of those inverted T's here and then the fact that your, these waves are really high, they're indicate like hypertrophy, that the muscle of the.

PATIENT X483
It's called high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X483
Right, right.

PATIENT X483
Yeah QRS complex.

DOCTOR X483
Right exactly.

PATIENT X483
So maybe it was ischemic.

DOCTOR X483
Well it's not ischemic, this doesn't necessarily mean ischemia it just means that you have high blood pressure.

PATIENT X483
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  This, these flipped T's mean that uh, you know it could mean ischemia, prior ischemia.

PATIENT X483
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
Alright.

DOCTOR X483
The fact that these waves aren't really elevated means that you're not having like a heart attack like right now or something.

PATIENT X483
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X483
But this may or may not so I think the best thing to do would be, since you got the shortness of breath when you walked is just to do a stress test.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
A treadmill stress test.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
They put some things on your chest.

PATIENT X483
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X483
Stick these on the chest, you run on a treadmill or walk on a treadmill; under stress situation and they see if your heart has any ischemia.

PATIENT X483
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
Alright.

DOCTOR X483
So we'll set that up.

PATIENT X483
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR X483
Right that's one.  The second have you ever been on cholesterol medicine?

PATIENT X483
No.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  So, are you fasting today or did you eat?

PATIENT X483
I haven't eaten anything that's why my stomach's growling.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  Well I'm gonna lay out two options for you okay.  Let me show you something.  This is your cholesterol profile.  Okay this was in January of this year, this is what we got recently last time I saw you.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
This is what it was in 2008.  LDL, LDL cholesterol is the bad cholesterol.  We want as less of that as possible okay in our body.  You are 117, that's pretty good.  I mean a normal healthy person, a young healthy person we want 160 or less.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay and uh with someone with high blood pressure, as we get older we may be like the number 130 or less so you're still at that goal.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
But in January you were 176, it's fairly high.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
For a guy that, your risk factor for heart attack are high blood pressure, your age and you're smoking.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay so those three risk factors if you put it into a calculator and with your cholesterol profile puts you at risk of having a heart attack at about 25% in the next ten years.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  So we want to lower that risk as much as possible okay.  So your goal by that calculator would be this goal should be less than 100.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
But you're above on that okay.  Your HDL that's the good cholesterol okay.  We want that at least 45 or above in males.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
So you're good there.  You have enough of the good cholesterol.  Triglycerides are okay.  Your total cholesterol number is high as well.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay which is probably @@@ that as well.  So this number is pretty high.

PATIENT X483
So I got to get that LDL down uh.

DOCTOR X483
You get the LDL down so, this one is, we could either since this number was so good and this was in 2008, I'm going to lay out the option we could either A recheck it.

PATIENT X483
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X483
And then based on what that shows we'd start you on a cholesterol medicine or we just go ahead and bite the bullet and start the cholesterol medicine today.

PATIENT X483
I would rather maybe recheck it because we cut down on a lot of the fatty; we eat a lot of fish now.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
So uh I'd rather recheck it.  It's probably once a month.

DOCTOR X483
With diet and exercise, if you optimize the diet, you can lower this by about, they say about 15%.

PATIENT X483
Without medications.

DOCTOR X483
Without medications.

PATIENT X483
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X483
Okay so you know.  If you lower this that 15%, you know you take 15% off of this, that still wouldn't take you at the goal of 100 or less.

PATIENT X483
Right.

DOCTOR X483
I just want you to understand that.

PATIENT X483
Right.

DOCTOR X483
Now if you do optimizing nutrition in your diet, I don't want you and this gets lower I don't want you and we still start you on cholesterol medicine I don't want that to disturb you or do all this work and it meant nothing.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
Right that's not true because you won't need that high of a dose of the medicine A or as you continue to exercise or if you cut out your smoking, you know your other risk factors may go away.  Smoking is a big one that you could change.  

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Your age you probably can't change right.

PATIENT X483
Right.

DOCTOR X483
You can't do anything about your age and you have to change the fact that you have high blood pressure.

PATIENT X483
Right.

DOCTOR X483
We can control it, we can't change the fact that you have it okay, we can’t change the fact that you had it, but you can change the fact that you smoke and that will change your risk okay.

PATIENT X483
Yeah I'd rather see if I can get that LDL down and have it rechecked.

DOCTOR X483
So you haven’t, you haven't ate today so would you like to have it rechecked today?

PATIENT X483
Uh I'd rather do it on the next visit cause I'd like to try to do something to get it down.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.

PATIENT X483
Uh if possible because you know that's a big jump from 117 to 176.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah it is a big.

PATIENT X483
So that's the total isn't it?

DOCTOR X483
Yeah this was in September of 08 you know.

PATIENT X483
Yeah it could've been the diet, you know if you ask me.

DOCTOR X483
I don't know if you were fasting that day either.  That shouldn't throw things off too much because if you were eating and it was real high because you're eating your triglycerides would have been high so I don't think, I think these are fairly accurate measurements.

PATIENT X483
Oh wait a minute, you know why it's up, my weight's gone up 20 pounds.  See I normally keep it at a constant weight.  I'm 20 pounds higher, I'm normally 165.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah and you're 180, you're 185.

PATIENT X483
Yeah right, right so.

DOCTOR X483
So.

PATIENT X483
It's this extra weight.

DOCTOR X483
Would you like, let me tell you this.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.

DOCTOR X483
So do you want us to hold off on starting the medicine or would you like to start a low dose of the cholesterol medicine, do your diet and exercise.

PATIENT X483
What are the side effects?

DOCTOR X483
Side effects of the cholesterol medicines it's generally a safe medicine.  You can get some muscle pain with it.

PATIENT X483
Oh, that sounds find.

DOCTOR X483
You can get some muscle pain with it.  If you get muscle pain with it you stop it and you come back and tell us.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
But that's the major side effect.

PATIENT X483
Oh okay, yeah a low dose maybe.

DOCTOR X483
You want to try a low dose?

PATIENT X483
Yes I would like to try it.

DOCTOR X483
We'll start a low dose.

PATIENT X483
Okay yeah I was worried about side effects.

DOCTOR X483
I want you to still do the diet and exercise and I want you to lose those extra pounds.

PATIENT X483
Yeah.  I mean.

DOCTOR X483
That way when we check it in six months your cholesterol may be at the goal we want it and we could maybe.

PATIENT X483
Take me off it?

DOCTOR X483
Exactly.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Alright.

PATIENT X483
Yeah I am 20 pounds over my weight so.

DOCTOR X483
Yeah and you're not going to be able to lose that weight overnight.  You know it's going to take some time so maybe the cholesterol medicine might be a good thing to start you with okay.

PATIENT X483
Uh-huh.  Yeah cause I mean if it was low, I was 20 pounds lighter so then I gained this weight and the cholesterol goes up.  That's got to be it.

DOCTOR X483
You want to pick it up today or do you want it sent to you?

PATIENT X483
Uh they can send it to me.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  So take this medicine at night okay?

PATIENT X483
Okay.  Just one time a night.

DOCTOR X483
One time a night.  The reason why we have it at night cause actually your cholesterol level goes high at night.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay while you're sleeping.  It's the natural cycle of the body so when you take it in the evening dose.  Okay it's going to give you instructions like it's a 20 mg tablet and the instructions are to break it in half so I only started you on a low dose, 10 mg okay.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Um.

PATIENT X483
So I just take one half each night.

DOCTOR X483
Each night.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
Okay.  I renewed your other blood pressure medicines which isn't a problem alright.  You're going to try to quit smoking and I'll give you the information on that.

PATIENT X483
Right.

DOCTOR X483
And uh let me order the stress test.  Now they're gonna send you out a letter telling you when to come in for the stress test okay.

PATIENT X483
Okay no problem.

DOCTOR X483
Um and you may need to stop your uh, just hold your metoprolol.

PATIENT X483
Okay.

DOCTOR X483
They'll give you instructions.

PATIENT X483

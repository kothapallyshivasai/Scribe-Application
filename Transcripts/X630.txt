PATIENT X630
How you doing doc?

DOCTOR X630 
Good to see you.  Come on back.

PATIENT X630
Yeah.

DOCTOR X630
So @@@ right in the entrance here.

PATIENT X630
Tape recorder.

DOCTOR X630
Oh tape recorder.  Why?  Who?

PATIENT X630
A lady doing research.

DOCTOR X630
Ah, for reports.

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
Okay.  I was looking at your chart @@@ and uh from, was it a car accident?

PATIENT X630
I had a car accident.  Someone hit me and now my back is messed up a little bit.

DOCTOR X630
Okay.

PATIENT X630
And uh when I came in um my blood pressure I guess was sky high so I explained some of that what I was trying to do was lose some weight and watch my diet and he said he didn't think it was smart because it's too high.

DOCTOR X630
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X630
And then after that, about a week after, my brother is active duty military.

DOCTOR X630
Oh.

PATIENT X630
Uh he had a stroke and he's younger. He's 38 years old and so when he had the stroke then I spoke with my mother and inquired more about my dad.  My dad died here in xxx Brown in 2002.

DOCTOR X630
Oh.

PATIENT X630
Massive heart attack.

DOCTOR X630
At what age?

PATIENT X630
He was 68, 69.

DOCTOR X630
Young, definitely should have been older.

PATIENT X630
Right.  So what I'm thinking is that I'm not even going to try them all anymore.  Whatever you want to do.

DOCTOR X630
I think so, no um it's true when you're in pain the blood pressure tends to get a little bit high.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Uh so but, so even through blaming the pain on the last visit for your high blood pressure.  Every other time that you've had high blood pressure with pain might be the reason and it seems a little bit higher than, well it's not as high as the blood pressure is here so that kind of extra increase might have been the cause of the problem.

PATIENT X630
Sure.

DOCTOR X630
But even today it's high.  Now uh we talked about, the last time, I mean I know you were reluctant about the blood pressure medications that you wanted to try with a little bit diet and weight change; however, in the last visit here, are you on the hydrochlorothiazide or not?

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
Have it or not?

PATIENT X630
Right I started taking it.

DOCTOR X630
Okay @@@.

PATIENT X630
I ran out and I was unaware that I was supposed to get a refill.  I was just unaware of it though.

DOCTOR X630
How long ago that you ran out?

PATIENT X630
Uh it's been about maybe five days.

DOCTOR X630
Five days so you took it for five days or you ran out five days ago?

PATIENT X630
I ran out of it five days ago right.

DOCTOR X630
Alright.  So go ahead and put the coat there.  Okay.  Um and were you able to measure the blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X630
Uh you know actually every day after I got through with my work-out at the gym.

DOCTOR X630
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X630
I went to the local CVS and they had a blood pressure machine.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah.

PATIENT X630
And it was terrible.  It was anywhere between say somewhere between 170 to 190 on the high number.

DOCTOR X630
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X630
And the lowest number today was the lowest I've seen in I don't know how long so, I'm not I guess whatever's happening I'm not doing very well with it.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah and the other thing, when it first high you were taking the blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X630
I was taking it.

DOCTOR X630
You were taking it so even with the blood pressure medication because of decreasing is not going well.  What happens usually, everything the blood pressure medication will decrease, the big number the one that we're worried about, um by maybe 20, 25 mg no more than that so if your blood pressure is at above 160 we might have to gradually, not right away, not in one day but treat it gradually.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
But eventually you might need more than one blood pressure medication and um the fact that.  How's your brother doing by the way?

PATIENT X630
Uh he has paralysis and also he has, as he was explaining to me, this affected the other side of his brain too because he has loss of memory.

DOCTOR X630
Oh.

PATIENT X630
Loss of sight and I mean he's a physical specimen. He trained with the SEALS so he's a specimen.

DOCTOR X630
Wow.

PATIENT X630
And uh you know the same something, the headaches and things like that that I was getting.

DOCTOR X630
Yes.  Yes.  Because at old, furthermore, old tests that they've done should see, there were different reasons that caused the blood pressure sometimes it could be the kidney, sometimes it could be certain hormones, none of them really told us anything to pinpoint where this high blood pressure was actually coming from.  So I agree we definitely have to think about um maybe being aggressive.  It doesn't mean that um exercise and diet are not important.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Because what happens is um usually, not all the time, but usually a lot of conditions come together meaning blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes are at least they are the number one conditions that really will cause a stroke or heart attack or so forth and um even though @@@ the exercise and diet will probably not decrease the blood pressure back to normal levels, it will be good, they will help with the blood pressure medications but they also will have the cholesterol and the risk of developing diabetes.  Right now, of course you're young, but right now you don't have, looking at the numbers.

PATIENT X630
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X630
You don't have anything.  You don't have the diagnosis of diabetes but the sugar high, that number that you are at risk of developing diabetes.  Exactly what I'm saying is in order to diagnose diabetes, what uh the actual studies, the numbers that the use you have to have one sugar when you're fasting, when you haven't eaten, 1.6, the number is 1.6 or above.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Measured to top 70, not in the same day.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
We measure it today and then measure a week from now and if it is greater than the 1.6 or above that's diabetes.  That's one of the ways we have.  The labs come back, you don't have diabetes.  That's kind of how we have to define this too so we can treat the patients but diabetes is not one of the conditions that you have it, but you didn't have it yesterday and all of a sudden now we're treating you diabetes every day, that's how it works.

PATIENT X630
Glyburide.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
So when the sugars are anywhere between 100 to 125, that's kind of the borderline that you are at risk of developing diabetes which means you don't have it yet.

PATIENT X630
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X630
By definition, you're at risk but we can do things to prevent it, to delay it, to prevent it from becoming full grown diabetes.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
So you @@@ it to be 109, so you are at that risk range, but you are at a good blood pressure and of course lose the weight.  So most of the time, exercise and diet will improve the blood pressure, will improve the risk of developing diabetes and cholesterol level.  I think we'll check one thing because I don't think we, because you've been young I'm not sure if we have a cholesterol level on you yet.  We do have a cholesterol, it is 150 and the cholesterol is the other thing.  So your cholesterol, the bad cholesterol which um I will just mentioned it, you know they are just called LDL.

PATIENT X630
LDL.

DOCTOR X630
LDL that's the bad cholesterol.  For different people there are different brackets meaning if somebody is older than 65.  If somebody 65 year old has had a heart attack, that number should be like a 70.  

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
If somebody who's young, in your case young but with no medical problems whatsoever, that number should be less than 160 and then everybody else is somewhere in between meaning that depending upon the risk factors somebody else you can have the goal of a l60, or 130 or less than 100 @@@.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
I think in your case because of the family case reason and also the blood pressure, the goal should be less than 130.

PATIENT X630
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X630
Yours is 160.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
It's high so that puts you at risk and um you can, like in the long term for stroke.

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
But usually almost never the first treatment is never to start cholesterol medication right away.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
We need to give, we need to start a medication for blood pressure, no question about it but we need should give time to @@@ to try to decrease that, to try to decrease that.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Cholesterol even more and in the long term I think we will have to use it because the benefits of having that if we don't reach the goal of the LDL level of 130 uh would be, the advantage would be great and would make the indications if I used them then they work right away, the goal is to correct that number somehow.

PATIENT X630
Well whatever you need be, I @@@.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah and I get that in but in the meantime do you have any questions.

PATIENT X630
Uh no, I have one question.

DOCTOR X630
Sure.

PATIENT X630
Well I mean I don't have to ask you now because.

DOCTOR X630
Yes.

PATIENT X630
Uh it's down in writing but this medication is not gonna stop my uh sexual prowess will it?

DOCTOR X630
No it shouldn't.  Um all medications have certain side effects.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Um and there really is no medication, even the simple pain Tylenol can have side effects.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Uh the medications that we, the strong blood pressure medications what we call cardiovascular medications that can cause decreased erections usually would be different families of blood pressure medications.  The most common ones are called beta blockers and they usually end with the letters ol meaning metoprolol, carvedilol basically there's different families and if they haven't been used for some time for blood pressure medications but we don't usually use them as a first line of treatment in somebody @@@.

PATIENT X630
Sounds good.

DOCTOR X630
The medications that you um will have been using and that we'll start is the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X630
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X630
The most common @@@ is between 50 and 60.

PATIENT X630
Right, right.

DOCTOR X630
So the only thing I would recommend is don't take it in the evening.

PATIENT X630
Right.  That's no problem.  I drink a lot of water so that's no problem.  I'm not going to do anything different.

DOCTOR X630
Um it's once a day.  As I said this medication will most likely not bring the blood pressure to where we want it to so we'll have to introduce a second blood pressure medication which is called nifedipine, it's a calcium channel and that's another family.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Called nifedipine.  That can make you pee uh; it is great actually for blood pressure control.  One of the, not common, but one of the side effects that is known is sometimes it can cause swelling of the legs and if it does cause swelling of the legs and if it's bothersome we can switch it to something else.

PATIENT X630
So if it swells my legs it won't be do I, I still be able to walk.

DOCTOR X630
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X630
Oh I see, no problem.  My legs, I need my legs @@@ anyway so.

DOCTOR X630
No, no it's something about the mechanism of the pill yeah.

PATIENT X630
You bet, okay.

DOCTOR X630
That's @@@.

PATIENT X630
Okay, sure.  

DOCTOR X630
Now um, in terms of the diet, we talked the last time.

PATIENT X630
I'm doing very well.  I haven't been eating that much fried food.

DOCTOR X630
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X630
Uh I don't do the uh sweets anymore at the nighttime like I used to.  I've cut down a lot but I actually gained five pounds working out.

DOCTOR X630
That's alright.

PATIENT X630
Um I think I was 152 when I came here last time.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah.

PATIENT X630
252 or something like that.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah.

PATIENT X630
I'm on 259 now.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah so now that sort of number.  Do you, although, besides hydrating are you eating more or about the same?

PATIENT X630
I'm eating a lot less.  I'm eating a lot less and in between my meals I'm drinking a protein so instead, what I was doing was I was eating at first.

DOCTOR X630
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X630
And now I'm just taking a protein shake and like I said I cut all of the @@@ now.

DOCTOR X630
Do you eat breakfast?

PATIENT X630
I eat breakfast.

DOCTOR X630
Good.  The other trick here, in addition to exercise and so there are two things, one with diet is breakfast, you're doing the right things and the other thing is smaller meals.  Frequent small meals so never @@@.  You don't want to do large meals because those are the worst.  Small meals, frequent meals and sometimes to suppress the hunger or the cravings um you uh whether it's uh like almonds or you can @@@ like almonds.

PATIENT X630
Okay.  Oh almonds.  

DOCTOR X630
Or whatever and those will have fiber and @@@ walk.  So while you're working out, basically have a small uh whatever, a bag of walnuts and almonds and that is a great depressant for the hunger for that.  The other thing is at least kind of can we have seen the status is um the best way to with @@@ to lose weight.  Usually what people do in the gym if they are indoors they will run and then they will lift.

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
Right.  Actually the opposite is better for losing weight.

PATIENT X630
Which makes sense because you heat up the body, then you run.

DOCTOR X630
Yeah.

PATIENT X630
Yeah.

DOCTOR X630
And then so kind of @@@.

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
They both seem to be.

PATIENT X630
Okay, so that's what I'll do.

DOCTOR X630
Losing a little bit more.

PATIENT X630
But you know why they do that?  Why they run and lift weights?

DOCTOR X630
But uh, so usually the very first thing because they think and so what happens is that the very first thing that body is to burn is the carbohydrates, the sugars before it burns the fat.

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
And uh the best way to burn the carbohydrate is lifting or something that will burn your muscles and then the @@@ will burn the @@@.  The way that people used to do it the opposite is because they thought well they would warm up the body with their running.

PATIENT X630
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR X630
And they burn off the muscles and then go in and take the @@@.  So you know they say whatever works better but whatever works better.

PATIENT X630
That might work better for me.

DOCTOR X630
Uh let's see.  How's the pain now after the car accident?

PATIENT X630
Uh it's okay.  I'm going to a chiropractor now.

DOCTOR X630
Okay and it helps?

PATIENT X630
And uh the first week if felt like it was doing, I mean it felt like they were hurting me worse than the car accident.

DOCTOR X630
Hmm.

PATIENT X630
They said that that's the first sign of treatment.

DOCTOR X630
Okay.

PATIENT X630
And I didn't know about, I didn't know that doctors of medicine don't really acknowledge chiropractors as doctors.

DOCTOR X630
No, no, they do.  It's all um, it's all individual basis and individual based on tests and the type of people that I do now is they go to school and they learn.

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
Basically they're good with what they do.  The best way is to have an understanding of ask what they do and that what we recommend.

PATIENT X630
Right, right.

DOCTOR X630
Because they help uh in a lot of cases.  There are cases where they don't help and there are cases that they make things worse so we need to, we need to both understand the chiropractor in order to kind of help each other to prevent bad things from happening but and @@@ the muscle and a lot of times they are good at what they do.  Uh it's not all about medication @@@ sometimes it's manipulation but I've seen where to have this conversation.  But yeah no they are doctors @@@.  Take a deep breath in.  You can breathe normally.  Good.  You sound great.  Uh and no smoking right?

PATIENT X630
No no smoking.

DOCTOR X630
Alright give me a moment.  Do you have any questions of any kind?

PATIENT X630
Uh not yet, but I appreciate it.

DOCTOR X630
No problem, have a seat I will be right back.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:49  DOCTOR IN:  22:38)

DOCTOR X630
Uh do you want to, for the blood pressure medication that you're taking half a pill.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
We're gonna go to a full pill and that's the maximum dose.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Um and then what we need to do in about two weeks have you come just to visit the nurse just for a blood pressure check.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
To see how well it is controlling the blood pressure and then at the time um we might have to start the second medication, to see if we have to.  Hopefully we don't have to but you know if you have to uh we don't want to start both at the same time to drop the blood pressure.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Too rapidly and uh that uh.  Oh do you want to pick them up or do you want it by mail?

PATIENT X630
Uh.

DOCTOR X630
The blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X630
How long, well you wouldn't know how long it would take.

DOCTOR X630
Uh usually it takes just a half hour or 45 minutes and it'll probably be ready.

PATIENT X630
Oh no okay, I'll wait, then mail it, then mail it.

DOCTOR X630
The mail I can do that.

PATIENT X630
I'll pick it up, I'd like to get started yes, I'll get started.

DOCTOR X630
Alright.  

PATIENT X630
And I'm supposed to take them the same time every day.

DOCTOR X630
Uh well usually @@@ right now except just one pill right.

PATIENT X630
Right.

DOCTOR X630
But if we have to add the second one and that's gonna be also a once a day medication.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
Um what I usually do is I tell patients is to take one, to take it in the morning the water pill that makes you pee.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
And that's good for 24 hours and then the other one they take it in the evening so and that's taken always at the same time, like you said at the same time because what happens is they kind of help each other, they stagger so you don't take them both in the morning because if you could take them both in the morning the next morning right before you take the blood pressure medications your blood pressure might be high because the effects of those medications might be almost out.

PATIENT X630
Gotcha right.

DOCTOR X630
But if you kind of take one in the morning and one in the evening they kind of complement each other much better.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
And it helps.  Alright.  So if you give this to the clerk and tell them to make an appointment with the nurse.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
For two weeks for a blood pressure check.

PATIENT X630
Oh okay, thank you very much doc.

DOCTOR X630
And uh you have @@@ and then the Pharmacy for medication.

PATIENT X630
Okay.

DOCTOR X630
The Pharmacy is the last place.

PATIENT X630
Always good seeing you.

DOCTOR X630
@@@ good luck.  They'll send you @@@.

PATIENT X630
Okay alright thank you very much.

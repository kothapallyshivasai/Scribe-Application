DOCTOR X284
PATIENT?

PATIENT X284 
How you doing?

DOCTOR X284
Alright thank you.  @@@.

PATIENT X284
Uh DOCTOR.  I don't care.

DOCTOR X284
So what's going on?  What brings you in today?

PATIENT X284
Okay uh, I was here I think the 6th and the reason I came in, well let me back track.  In September I had bladder surgery for removal of the bladder because of uh cancer and then I noticed this was starting to get swelled up.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.

PATIENT X284
Just the left, just around here okay.

DOCTOR X284
Alright.

PATIENT X284
Now um after surgery when I was in Recovery it swelled up.  They had that machine on there to do the pumping.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah.

PATIENT X284
And then I don't know why it's swelling up.

DOCTOR X284
So you had surgery when did you say?

PATIENT X284
September 6th.

DOCTOR X284
It swelled up then, following surgery.

PATIENT X284
Right.

DOCTOR X284
Was it both sides or just the left?

PATIENT X284
Just the left.

DOCTOR X284
Did it slowly go away then after surgery or has it been there since then?

PATIENT X284
No, it went away um.  I had a month's supply of injections I was giving to myself for clots.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.  Have you ever had a clot, blood clot before?

PATIENT X284
No not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR X284
So when did you first notice that it was starting to swell again?

PATIENT X284
Um probably maybe a month ago.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.  Has it gotten worse or is it just about the same from when you noticed it?

PATIENT X284
No it was worse but then it went down.

DOCTOR X284
So it went down a little bit.

PATIENT X284
But it's still swollen.

DOCTOR X284
Swollen still.

PATIENT X284
Oh wait a minute, show you this, I don't know if NAME gave it to me.

DOCTOR X284
Oh for the thing.

PATIENT X284
Oh it must. 

DOCTOR X284
Yeah I think so.

PATIENT X284
Can I leave it right here?

DOCTOR X284
Yeah that's okay.

PATIENT X284
(Laughter)  

DOCTOR X284
So it got more swollen, let's see and now it's went down.  Alright.  Any pain associated with it?  Any redness?

PATIENT X284
Just the way it is now.

DOCTOR X284
Prior to this all starting back in September, had you ever had uh swelling like that before, in this leg at all?

PATIENT X284
No, nothing.

DOCTOR X284
You don't have any history of this before.  Any other medical issues, high blood pressure?  You don't have any problem with heart disease or heart attack or heart failure? 

PATIENT X284
Uh they discovered I have a fib.

DOCTOR X284
A fib.  Are you on Coumadin?

PATIENT X284
No.

DOCTOR X284
No.  Let's see your medications, you have an albuterol inhaler.

PATIENT X284
Which I really do not use that often at all.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.  They have you on Digoxin is that for the a fib I assume?

PATIENT X284
Yeah it's for the heart.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.

PATIENT X284
Once a day.

DOCTOR X284
You're taking that.  You're on the metoprolol?

PATIENT X284
Right twice a day.

DOCTOR X284
Sildenafil?

PATIENT X284
Yeah the reason um they uh prescribed that is because before I had the uh surgery to remove the bladder at the same time they removed the prostate because it was high PSA.

DOCTOR X284
I see.

PATIENT X284
So while they were there they might as well take it and prior to that surgery um my wife and I enjoyed a very good sexual active life in the 44 years we've been married.

DOCTOR X284
Sure.

PATIENT X284
Now after the surgery I cannot get an erection uh.  They told me that they would do all they could with the nerve-sparing.

DOCTOR X284
Hmm.

PATIENT X284
Okay so what they uh started out doing is um giving me the uh sildenafil which is I guess Viagra.

DOCTOR X284
Viagra.

PATIENT X284
And uh that is not working.

DOCTOR X284
Hmm.

PATIENT X284
They got me a pump.

DOCTOR X284
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X284
And I've been using that but I stopped using that because I can, it'll get hard but as soon as I take the pump away, even with the rings on the penis.

DOCTOR X284
Hmm.

PATIENT X284
It just.

DOCTOR X284
Goes away.

PATIENT X284
Goes away and then uh what else.  I'll be coming back here on the 25th I believe where they will either give me an injection in the penis with some medicine or put it right down the urethra.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X284
Okay and we'll see if that works so.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah.

PATIENT X284
I'm fucked.  Excuse me.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah that's a difficult thing and unfortunately that's one of the concerns with taking out the prostate and you see sometimes there'll be erectile dysfunction afterwards.

PATIENT X284
And like I said you know prior to the surgery you know I didn't have any problems at all.  You know I didn't have any ED at all but then they warned me.  They also said that it might take up until a year for it to come back where I'll be able to get an erection again but if none of this therapy, so-called therapy doesn't work, will it come back naturally? I don't know.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah.

PATIENT X284
Nobody knows.

DOCTOR X284
Um how about, have you been having shortness of breath at all or problems breathing since you've had the swelling?

PATIENT X284
No not really.

DOCTOR X284
No chest pain at all?

PATIENT X284
No and you know I, I'm a smoker and unfortunately I still smoke uh.  They asked me if I needed help quitting and they said you know if I quit you know I'll do it on my own.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.

PATIENT X284
But I drastically cut down you know from what I was smoking before the surgery.

DOCTOR X284
Sure.  Yeah I mean if you would like to quit smoking, if you need any help at that time whenever you decide you're are ready.

PATIENT X284
Yeah they all say these things here.

DOCTOR X284
Um it looks like that was normal.  The echocardiogram, just looking at some of your stuff that was normal.  Your heart function was relatively normal back in August.  I don't know if you remember them doing that.

PATIENT X284
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X284
So yeah, let me have a look at you here.  Have a seat over here.  Take a moment to wash my hands.  I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs here.

PATIENT X284
Want the jacket off?

DOCTOR X284
No I'll just slide down here no problem.  Take some deep breaths for me.  @@@, a little bright right in the eyes.  So never any swelling in this one at all?

PATIENT X284
No.

DOCTOR X284
No pain there, you don't have anything there.  How much would you say it was at one point?  Quite a bit worse from what it is now?

PATIENT X284
You know just maybe 10 or 15% more than it is now.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah.  

PATIENT X284
And in the back it's swollen.

DOCTOR X284
How about thigh at all, do you notice it in the thigh at all?

PATIENT X284
No.

DOCTOR X284
It stops at the knee?

PATIENT X284
Yeah.

DOCTOR X284
No pain on pushing here.  No pain when I'm doing the anything there at all?

PATIENT X284
No.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.  I'm going to have you lay back down.  Let's see your pouch over here.

PATIENT X284
Right there.

DOCTOR X284
You haven't had any issues with that; it's been draining fine and everything?

PATIENT X284
Yes.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.  No pain in the belly here.

PATIENT X284
No.

DOCTOR X284
When I'm pushing around anywhere.

PATIENT X284
No.

DOCTOR X284
Or anything like that.  Alright.

PATIENT X284
Can I uh put my socks back on?

DOCTOR X284
Yeah, yeah that's fine.

PATIENT X284
And after I was here I saw the last time, the NURSE.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah.

PATIENT X284
And she said that DOCTOR would probably call.  Well he never called but she called saying that he wanted me to come in here.

DOCTOR X284
Today yeah.

PATIENT X284
Sooner than the 25th.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah to see me yeah.

PATIENT X284
Because of the possibility of maybe a clot.

DOCTOR X284
Blood clot.

PATIENT X284
Yeah.

DOCTOR X284
That's what we're probably concerned about.  So, yeah sometimes blood clots can cause swelling in the leg.  I think we should, I'm going to talk to my attending but I think we should probably check.  I'm not really convinced about there being a blood clot in there because usually when you have a blood clot in there patients have a lot of pain associated with it in the calf or they'll even have some redness and swelling um which you told me you have not had an issue with.

PATIENT X284
Right.

DOCTOR X284
But you are at an increased risk of blood clots just because you have had surgery here in the past and the tests they do is pretty easy, it's just some jelly on the leg and they do a Doppler ultrasound, similar to an ultrasound.

PATIENT X284
Yeah that's what she had mentioned.

DOCTOR X284
@@@.

PATIENT X284
Now I might mention this, now I've never been diagnosed but when the weather is cold.

DOCTOR X284
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X284
My fingers on both hands, not at the same time, might turn white and uh I think it's something called Raynaud.

DOCTOR X284
Raynaud's phenomenon yeah.

PATIENT X284
But then after a while, you know they warm up and it goes away but it happens quite often.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.  Yeah that's another one of those things that's common.

PATIENT X284
Hmm.

DOCTOR X284
And unless it causes you a lot of disability and pain there are medications you can take for it but they don't work that well.

PATIENT X284
No.

DOCTOR X284
Usually our thing is, wear gloves when you're gonna be outside.

PATIENT X284
I don't want to take any more medication.  I'm taking enough now.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah.

PATIENT X284
And I just don't like to take any pills whatsoever but what are you gonna do as you get older.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah, that's just part of the process.  Um let me go chat with the other doc, with the attending doctor and talk about if there's anything else you know we'll want to do or think about and then I'll come back on in and let you know okay.

PATIENT X284
Okay.

DOCTOR X284
Be back with you shortly.

(DOCTOR OUT:  61:27  DOCTOR IN:  69:44)

(Knock on door)

PATIENT X284
Hello.

DOCTOR X284
Alright, sorry for the delay.

PATIENT X284
Doctor how do you spell your name?

DOCTOR X284
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X284
And your first name?

DOCTOR X284
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X284
Yeah okay, thank you.

DOCTOR X284
So I called the Vascular Lab and actually I'll send you up to the fifth floor to have them do that test right now.

PATIENT X284
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X284
Just to make sure that that's not what's going on cause that's part of the treatment if it is.  

PATIENT X284
What could it be if isn't a clot?

DOCTOR X284
If it's not a clot I'm not exactly sure what is causing it um and if it bothers you, we can try like some TED hose type things which is just compression, type of compression stocking.

PATIENT X284
Oh.

DOCTOR X284
Um but otherwise we can, I was going to just have you follow back up with DOCTOR cause you're scheduled to see him on the 28th of this month here so in a few weeks.

PATIENT X284
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X284
Um and the other thing you can do is sometimes people just have some difficulties with maintaining their fluid balance and they lose fluid and usually it's bilateral which is kind of like.

PATIENT X284
Well I drink a lot of liquids.

DOCTOR X284
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X284
All day long.  Not only fruit juices but water, coffee, tea, diet soda.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah.

PATIENT X284
I'm constantly emptying the bag.

DOCTOR X284
The bag.  You could cut down, try cutting.  How much are you drinking in a full day?  Would you say how many you know how much would you say 8 ounce?

PATIENT X284
Uh I might have like a beer before dinner but not every day.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.

PATIENT X284
Or like uh the other night we had lamb chops and I had a glass this much of wine.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.

PATIENT X284
Dark or red wine.  What would drinking have to do with the swelling?

DOCTOR X284
So this fluid is what, @@@ sometimes.

PATIENT X284
So that's fluid?

DOCTOR X284
Yeah I mean that's fluid, that's what is swollen that's actually fluid, you know.

PATIENT X284
Really.

DOCTOR X284
That went out of your blood vessels and into the tissue which is why I think.  I mean initially understand you were in the hospital and a lot of times when you're in the hospital having surgery you get a lot of fluid.  Do you remember, they probably gave you IV fluids and you know things and that's very common in patients you know who get, are in the hospital and have uh get a lot of intravenous fluids that sometimes they'll get swelling particularly in the legs.

PATIENT X284
From the IVs?

DOCTOR X284
Just from, more fluid, so your body, you only have so much space in any type of blood vessels for fluid and if you're, you know you should get rid of fluid or urinating or you get rid of through sweating and stuff like that but generally it's urinating out and sometimes if you're getting too much fluid, you get more fluid than actually the kidneys can keep up with cause all fluid has to be filtered out through the kidneys and it kind of builds up and it has to go somewhere um because you know fluid is something that's not compressible and only so much can fit in the blood vessels and when the blood vessels get too full it kind of leaks out and will go into the tissues.

PATIENT X284
Hmm.

DOCTOR X284
And then that's where you end up getting the swelling and the edema and the legs are a real common site for that to happen.  It's just a little concerning cause you never have problems with the right leg it's only ever in the left leg.

PATIENT X284
Just the left one yeah.

DOCTOR X284
We'll see what this shows and if you, are you interested in trying some TED hose type thing, stockings, would you wear that?

PATIENT X284
Well my wife can get them at her work, she works at Walmart.

DOCTOR X284
Okay.  You can try that and then come back and is it is still really bothering the only other thing we can do just to see if it is a big fluid imbalance we can give you a diuretic which will just remove a little bit.

PATIENT X284
Is that like a water pill?

DOCTOR X284
Yeah um a water pill.

PATIENT X284
Uh no, no like I said nothing hurts.

DOCTOR X284
Yeah but I mean it's also a matter of what becomes a bother.  If it bothers you if this was you know.  We worry about things that can cause concern, big problems.

PATIENT X284
Well am I drinking too much during the day based on what I told you, like I said.

DOCTOR X284
Well I mean it's like you're drinking, you're getting some but you don't seem to be drinking plenty fluids throughout the day.  But if you want to cut back a few days and see if that effects the swelling, I mean see if that makes any difference.

PATIENT X284
Yeah I can try that; I can experiment with that sure.

DOCTOR X284
I mean sort of drink some fluid, obviously throughout the day but first things first, make sure that there's not a blood clot in here.

PATIENT X284
Right.

DOCTOR X284
Causing all this um so I'll sign that and I will forward my notes to DOCTOR and if there is a blood clot I'll of course get the results you know will be back later today but call me and we'll start you on a blood thinner, something like what you were on before like the Lovenox, the shots.

PATIENT X284
It was something else.  What'd you call it?

DOCTOR X284
Lovenox or enoxaparin, was that what you were on?  Was it a blood thinner shot?

PATIENT X284
You know, all I know is just like I put it in and it just, when I pushed the needle went in and came right out.

DOCTOR X284
Hmm.  Maybe we're @@@.

PATIENT X284
I can't think of the name.  But I had a 30 day supply of it and they told me to use it all.

DOCTOR X284
@@@.  Alright.

PATIENT X284
Okay so where do I go now?

DOCTOR X284
Fifth floor, just go to the check-in desk on the fifth floor.

PATIENT X284
Okay.  That's all I have to do?

DOCTOR X284
Yep.

PATIENT X284
Okie doke.

DOCTOR X284
And they'll do the test real quick to be sure.  If it's positive they'll give me a call.

PATIENT X284
Yeah let me know uh how late are you gonna be here today?

DOCTOR X284
They'll, if it's positive they'll have you stay there @@@.

PATIENT X284
Oh I see okay.

DOCTOR X284
Just check out here.  He's already scheduled to follow up with DOCTOR but if he needs anything he can also be with me.

PATIENT X284
Okay thanks doctor.

DOCTOR X284
Nice meeting you, take care.

PATIENT X284

DOCTOR X695
No good.  So this is just kind of a routine visit?  

PATIENT X695
Alright.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
Just a different doctor, different doctor.

DOCTOR X695
There's always a different doctor I know, I know.  Alright.  Your blood pressure's a bit high; um it's in the 150s.  What does it usually run at home or do you check it at all?

PATIENT X695
Well I haven't checked it lately but when she was, the first time she did it it stayed high?

DOCTOR X695
Yeah, yeah.  It was 152 and on the repeat it was 154.

PATIENT X695
Oh it was, see we was talking.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah.

PATIENT X695
And I wasn't you know if you get upset the blood pressure goes up.

DOCTOR X695
Oh I know, absolutely.

PATIENT X695
So I was talking about what @@@ did to me and that made my blood pressure go.

DOCTOR X695
Oh okay so you were upset.

PATIENT X695
So you might need to check it again and see if I'm relaxed some you know.

DOCTOR X695
Oh sure yeah we'll check it in a little bit.  Hopefully you won't.

PATIENT X695
Cause I mean that's what happened you know.  I got, a little I think I got a little upset cause of what she did to me, stuff like that you know.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
Otherwise it don't really be high I me.  When I took it at home it was like 130 something you know or something like that.  You know it don't be high like 150.

DOCTOR X695
So alright okay.  Let's see, I'm just gonna look at your lab work to see if there's anything done here recently.

PATIENT X695
I don't think so; I didn't have no blood taken in a while.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah we need to update that.  The last time you had anything was um electrolytes and checking your kidney function in July and back then it was okay.  So will you be able to go to the Lab, I mean have you eaten yet today?

PATIENT X695
Yeah I ate this morning.

DOCTOR X695
Yes.

PATIENT X695
Ate this morning, but I ain't had nothing for lunch.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.  So.

PATIENT X695
Which is more than like before 6 o'clock so you should be able to draw some blood right?

DOCTOR X695
Yeah the, unfortunately I want to check your cholesterol too and to check your cholesterol you can't have eaten anything um from midnight until you get the lab work and then.

PATIENT X695
So I got to come back okay.

DOCTOR X695
So yeah.  Yeah and you can do that anytime within the next month and I'll take a look at them and consider a follow-up.

PATIENT X695
Come in here, don't eat no breakfast, come in here and get it drawn and then you'll have that here.

DOCTOR X695
Right, yep, nothing after midnight and then come in here.  You know where you get it checked.

PATIENT X695
Yeah, yeah I know where I need to go.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah because I know you were hospitalized at St. xxx a little while ago.

PATIENT X695
That's cause I was given some metformin.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah.

PATIENT X695
It was too strong for me.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
It was too strong, it was 850 mg and it bothered my, I think the doctor said my liver or my kidneys one and when I got in the hospital he said no it no good for you which is, it was bothering me because it was sending me to the bathroom every hour, before the hour.

DOCTOR X695
Hmm.

PATIENT X695
Forceful urination.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
And then it kind of dehydrated me so I had to go to the Emergency Room at St. xxx cause the ambulance took me to the closest hospital to my house.

DOCTOR X695
Did they check your sugars then?  Did they see how high those were?

PATIENT X695
I think they checked everything.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
Otherwise they would've let me go.

DOCTOR X695
So now what are you taking for your blood sugars?

PATIENT X695
Glipizide and then metformin.

DOCTOR X695
Oh you're still taking the metformin.

PATIENT X695
But only at that lower dosage cause you gave me 850 mg and when I told them it made me sick, they changed me down to 450.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
That's what she did and its better but it's still almost like the same thing cause I have to go, it won't let me hold, I can't hold.

DOCTOR X695
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X695
No water, I have to go.  It don't matter where I'm at.

DOCTOR X695
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X695
It's like that feeling come on I have to go.

DOCTOR X695
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X695
And it come out, that's how those pills, some pills do me.  For some reason, I don't know why.

DOCTOR X695
So yeah, you know everybody reacts differently to medications.  Most of my patients who have diabetes are on 1000 of metformin twice a day.  That's the regular dose.

PATIENT X695
I don't think it's too strong for anybody.

DOCTOR X695
No it's actually, I mean it.

PATIENT X695
I guess it all depends on how your sugars is running.

DOCTOR X695
Oh it depends on your sugars.

PATIENT X695
Yeah cause mine are running really high.

DOCTOR X695
They're not running that normal.

PATIENT X695
Yeah so that's what I'm saying.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah absolutely, it depends on your sugars.  We don't want to drop your sugars too low and then um it really depends on each person and how they react to the medication.  You know in general metformin is one that a lot of people do tend to tolerate but everybody's different so you know you might have had urinary frequency from that.  A lot of times blood sugars being high can cause urinary frequency too.

PATIENT X695
But like I said I been controlling my sugars.

DOCTOR X695
Good, good.

PATIENT X695
And the thing is she took me off of insulin and said I shouldn't be taking insulin which I been taking insulin all along and put me on the metformin.  Uh the metformin, the dose that she gave me was too strong.

DOCTOR X695
Okay, good.

PATIENT X695
Because it was like sending me to the bathroom, just automatically just hurried up and ended me sending me to the bathroom and I never went to the bathroom that many times like that there and then finally it dehydrated me cause it just really dehydrates you.

DOCTOR X695
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X695
And they sent me home and boom I got dehydrated and almost passed out.

DOCTOR X695
So you're okay on the 500?

PATIENT X695
Uh 450 yeah, I'm better with it, 450 you know.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
Cause if it was bothering me I wouldn't want to take that either.  I mean I don't need to take something that makes me sick or make me go to the bathroom.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah.  Well um, let me see, so what I want to do is to check your cholesterol and I'm also gonna check your sugars and how they're being controlled.

PATIENT X695
Okay.

DOCTOR X695
Um do you test your sugars at home?

PATIENT X695
Sometimes I do, I stopped doing it for a while because you know that's two fingers every day and them fingers.

DOCTOR X695
@@@.

PATIENT X695
And them fingers, see all the marks on my fingertips there.

DOCTOR X695
Absolutely.

PATIENT X695
Cause I just learn, the new nurses that uh at @@@ showed me how to do it from the side so it don't you know cause I usually doing the tips, that's what I was taught to prick the tips, now when I do the sides.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah.

PATIENT X695
But you see all the marks, I mean I said I feel great I mean.  I thinks it's not that bad, I don't think I be having to draw, taking that sugar every day.

DOCTOR X695
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X695
But if you want me to take it every other day or something like then give you the results, I can do that.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah you know if it's stable every other day, every couple days then that's fine.

PATIENT X695
Then what, so what, how high should the sugar go?

DOCTOR X695
After you eat.

PATIENT X695
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X695
It's okay for it to go to 150-160.

PATIENT X695
Okay after I eat but before I eat, I usually take it before I eat.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah before you eat I tend to like to see it 110 and below.

PATIENT X695
110 and below.

DOCTOR X695
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X695
Okay, okay.  110 and below.

DOCTOR X695
But the test that I'm gonna do is going to check your blood sugars and how they've been controlled over the past three months, it's a test that kind of can see how it's been over the past month to three months.

PATIENT X695
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X695
So we'll get a better idea.

PATIENT X695
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR X695
Um let's see.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X695
Yes.

DOCTOR X695
When was that?  Oh actually I see it here, oh it was 2010.

PATIENT X695
I had a couple of those and the other one go down through my throat too.

DOCTOR X695
And in 2010 it looks like.

PATIENT X695
I had triple bypass, I had a gallbladder taken out, what else.  That's about it, the triple bypass and gallbladder taken out.  I don't have no gallbladder or whatever cause she said I had too many kidney stones and they had to take the bladder.  

DOCTOR X695
So you're good, cause they didn't see any precancerous tumors or anything in the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X695
Right, it was clear.

DOCTOR X695
So that's good.

PATIENT X695
It was all clear, no polyps, no none of that other stuff.

DOCTOR X695
Good.

PATIENT X695
It was clear.

DOCTOR X695
Good, good.

PATIENT X695
Both times it was clear.

DOCTOR X695
Good.  And then have you had the influenza shot this year?

PATIENT X695
She told me to come back and uh, she told me to come back when December?

DOCTOR X695
No it looks like you had it.

PATIENT X695
I had it in March but she said it's time to take another one so, she said it was time to take another one so to come back in a month or so and take another one.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
She said it due, unless you want me to take it today before I leave up out of here I mean.

DOCTOR X695
She wants you to take it today?

PATIENT X695
No, no, no, if you want me to.  She said come back and do it.

DOCTOR X695
Oh.

PATIENT X695
That's what she told me to come back and do it.

DOCTOR X695
It might have been a little early to get it so um you can get it done today, that's fine.

PATIENT X695
So where do I go get that at?

DOCTOR X695
You can just go to the nurse that checked you in.

PATIENT X695
And she'll give it to me?

DOCTOR X695
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X695
Oh okay, that's good.

DOCTOR X695
And then it looks like all your medications are good through the next year.  All the refills that you need.

PATIENT X695
Yeah all the refills.  Cause the only thing I really had run out of was uh stool softeners, my wife who uses them too.

DOCTOR X695
Oh it looks like you have enough now, but do you need some more?

PATIENT X695
I mean, like I said my wife had some left over so I'm gonna use hers before I come and get some more.  

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
I got that.  You know she had a bottle of 50 and I got that.

DOCTOR X695
Is it the same medication?

PATIENT X695
Its stool softeners.

DOCTOR X695
Yeah.

PATIENT X695
There no different kind of stool softeners is there?

DOCTOR X695
Yes there's many different kinds of stool softeners.

PATIENT X695
So the ones you buy at the store are like, you go to the store like xxx's, they ain't no good?

DOCTOR X695
Docusate, no they're good too but I'm just saying there are different kinds of stool softeners but at the same time you have to make sure you know the medication is what it is.  Is it prescribed to her or was it over-the-counter?

PATIENT X695
You go buy it, there's stool softeners on the shelf.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
I mean you know.

DOCTOR X695
Oh I see.

PATIENT X695
And you go buy them.

DOCTOR X695
Why would you buy them, you can get them here.

PATIENT X695
Because I, well I ran out, I have to have time to get over here and get them right so I go and buy them every once in a while, I go buying them, you know you just go buy them.  

DOCTOR X695
Sure.

PATIENT X695
They don't cost over $10.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
Instead of coming way over here cause I had to come a long ways to come over here just to get stool softeners.

DOCTOR X695
Okay.

PATIENT X695
You know what I mean.

DOCTOR X695
Good enough.

PATIENT X695
And so she was taking uh iron pills like I was taking iron pills but the doctor took her off of them so she had a whole bottle full I mean, why not use the ones she has, I was taking before, it works.

DOCTOR X695
I'm not saying you can't.

PATIENT X695
No I'm just asking.

DOCTOR X695
I just don't think you should.

PATIENT X695
I was asking you cause you said different stool softeners, well I ain't seen no different ones myself.

DOCTOR X695
Do you check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X695
Yes.

DOCTOR X695
And you said it runs what?

PATIENT X695
It'll run in like 150 something.

DOCTOR X695
And how high does it run?

PATIENT X695
Maybe 130 something.

DOCTOR X695

PATIENT X695
Sometime lower than that.

DOCTOR X695

DOCTOR X620 
PATIENT?  Hi.  How you doing?

PATIENT X620
Good.

DOCTOR X620
Do you need that @@@.

PATIENT X620
Yeah.

DOCTOR X620
@@@.

PATIENT X620
Oh I'm not sure, kind of like @@@.

DOCTOR X620
Don't you think some @@@.

PATIENT X620
@@@.  Um they did a MRI and a CAT scan and they say that the cyst hasn't came but whatever it was it's not back and that with my age and how much damage was done to my knees that they gonna wait a while before they give me a knee replacement.

DOCTOR X620
Okay.  We can take a look at it.

PATIENT X620
They say that I'm not old enough and the damage is not enough right now.

DOCTOR X620
Okay.  Are you able to get around and walk around?  There's no pain or anything I see.

PATIENT X620
No there's no pain but.

DOCTOR X620
You know you're gonna get in trouble wearing that.

PATIENT X620
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X620
(Laughter)  I'm not, I'm not I'm mean I'm from Texas so I'm not like a gold fan.

PATIENT X620
But uh.  I got pain and I been getting, you know this here has never; it's real tender just to the touch.

DOCTOR X620
You mean here?

PATIENT X620
Yeah a lot of the pain is.

DOCTOR X620
When was the MRI?  When did they do that?

PATIENT X620
About six months ago and um but they were saying that it's not a tumor and they're not gonna do me the operation that I needed to get the pain, get the pain therapy here.

DOCTOR X620
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X620
Because he's just a tumor specialist, he's not a regular doctor's appointment like here.

DOCTOR X620
Okay and are you still taking the Naproxen medication?

PATIENT X620
Uh do you know what the Naproxen don't do anything for me.

DOCTOR X620
It doesn't do anything for you okay.

PATIENT X620
Um I have um, I wanted to I got @@@, from the pill here.

DOCTOR X620
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X620
And I had it removed here two or three times.  Do I have to get a consult to go to them?  And now my main reason for me coming here is because, see they put me on some new medications @@@.

DOCTOR X620
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X620
And the reason I had quit taking the medications before was because there was nothing @@@.

DOCTOR X620
Okay.  I'll have to circle them.

PATIENT X620
Huh?

DOCTOR X620
Circle.

PATIENT X620
Right.

DOCTOR X620
What you're on now.

PATIENT X620
It's starting to get to the point where like it was doing the same thing as the other stuff was doing.  So he told me to come in and see you all and you can give me something to help me with this instead of me stopping taking the medicines like I did before.  

DOCTOR X620
You know I mean you're otherwise.

PATIENT X620
And I, you know and during the period of time they told me that I probably needed to be clean and what not so I been clean for over six months.

DOCTOR X620
Exactly what I was gonna say yeah.  Yeah so the last cocaine opiate positive urine drop you had was back in October and so it looks like you've been clean for about six months or so.

PATIENT X620
Right.

DOCTOR X620
Which is congratulations, excellent, great, that's really great.  Um you know uh I'm looking at your medications.  There's really nothing on here that jumped out at me as something that would preclude us from starting you on a medication for erectile dysfunction if that's the issue that's going on.

PATIENT X620
Okay.  

DOCTOR X620
Um you know to be honest it's usually and the two most common reasons are medication induced and then like, I don't want to use terms like psychiatric but you know it's kind of like you know up in the head kind of thing.  

PATIENT X620
When I stopped taking the medication that I was on before.

DOCTOR X620
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X620
It came back on its own. 

DOCTOR X620
That sounds about right and you know some of these medications obviously can have that affect so that's perfectly fine, it's not a problem.  Let's see here otherwise.  So I don't think we need to do an x-ray of the knee or anything since we just had that MRI done and it's still much more sensitive.  Um it sounds like you know the knee is fairly stable, if it's pain we need to address this issue.  And I think about physical therapy as well.

PATIENT X620
Right and you know every now and then I'll go take a step down and it'll catch you know and that be so much pain but other than that if I do a lot of walking then when I get home at night I have, when I try to go to sleep or relax I have problems.

DOCTOR X620
Okay.

PATIENT X620
But as long as I don't do no bunch of walking, say if I go to the Mall with my wife or something then I be in trouble.  But other than that if I just you know cause I'm driving most of the time, I don't do much walking.  I don't have too much problem but when I do walking a lot that's when I have problems.

DOCTOR X620
Well let's address the knee pain.  I can start you on a medication and see if that helps with the knee pain uh, get you hooked up with like a soft knee brace, that sort of thing like a Neoprene sleeve.  Just to kind of help out in terms of keeping it stable so that if it ever locks up or anything you don't like fall over.

PATIENT X620
Right.

DOCTOR X620
Or break something um and then also in addition I'd set you up with Physical Therapy.  Unfortunately here there's I mean there's so many patients and so few physical therapy it usually takes about a month or so.

PATIENT X620
No problem.

DOCTOR X620
To get you in the clinic but uh but they like little obstacles like you know about in the clinic and then come in for an initial evaluation.  For the callus we can get you set up with the podiatrist.

PATIENT X620
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X620
The doctors with actually no problem.  Um the erectile dysfunction issues vardenafil is perfectly fine.  We'll get you a refill, I'll refill the medication.

PATIENT X620
Okay.

DOCTOR X620
Uh unfortunately through the VA there is a restriction uh you get two pills a month.

PATIENT X620
Okay and then there's no problem, you know I got insurance so if I need more you can give me a prescription or I can go somewhere else and get it?

DOCTOR X620
Um if you need to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X620
But I'm gonna try it first and then I'll come back and see how it goes.

DOCTOR X620
Uh and then the only other issue is I was going back, so you don't need to get a colonoscopy again until 2012.

PATIENT X620
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X620
Uh still smoking?

PATIENT X620
Yes.  I wished I, that's the next thing I'm gonna work on.  You know they say don't stop everything at once.

DOCTOR X620
@@@.

PATIENT X620
I got rid of the heroin and cocaine.

DOCTOR X620
You've already done very well with that.

PATIENT X620
Me and my wife are feeling a lot better.  The family's doing better overall.

DOCTOR X620
Good.  Okay.  Sounds like you've turned things around man that's.

PATIENT X620
I'm just trying to be.

DOCTOR X620
I'm impressed.

PATIENT X620
Well, I got a beautiful family.  I've been with the same woman married 30 years.

DOCTOR X620
Congratulations.

PATIENT X620
And she never got high on anything, don't drink, don't smoke I don't even know how she stayed with me for 30 years.

DOCTOR X620
Put up with you, don't question it.  I mean obviously there's a lot going on.  We'll, you know we can address that any time.  If you want to you know even cutting down the amount that you smoke during the daytime.

PATIENT X620
Well you know what.

DOCTOR X620
I know that's its helpful and.

PATIENT X620
I have cut down a little bit.  I used to smoke, I used to smoke over, you know I would buy a pack of cigarettes every day.  Now when I wake up in the morning I have seven, eight cigarettes left you know and so I've had to make a conscious effort to quit smoking and the only thing is I'm so used to smoking after I eat.

DOCTOR X620
Yeah.

PATIENT X620
I'm so used to smoking when I'm in the bathroom so now basically them the only times that I'm smoking.

DOCTOR X620
Yeah.

PATIENT X620
You know I done cut off everything else it's just those times I can't, after I eat I have to smoke.

DOCTOR X620
Exactly and I @@@.

PATIENT X620
And when I use the bathroom I have to smoke so basically them the only times I'm smoking you know.

DOCTOR X620
And there's sort of a good push in terms of just the way that you know nicotine and the tobacco works in the mind and the way that you know we crave how regimented smoking is.

PATIENT X620
And I been doing it for so long.

DOCTOR X620
One of the best things to do and it sounds like you've done it already moving from a full pack to about a half pack a day.

PATIENT X620
Yeah.

DOCTOR X620
Is to think about like when you're smoking you know after meals, after using the restroom that sort of thing, you know take like maybe use the restroom after lunch.  Take that time to not use it at that time.

PATIENT X620
Yeah but I can do that to the point where I done cut down.

DOCTOR X620
Exactly.

PATIENT X620
So you know because my wife don't smoke and right now another thing is I stopped smoking in the house so.

DOCTOR X620
That's good then.

PATIENT X620
That's another reason, I don't want to get up and go outside and smoke because I used to be able to just sit there and smoke now.

DOCTOR X620
That's good cause I mean secondhand smoke is @@@ for lung disease for other people.

PATIENT X620
And she's been on me for years about smoking in the house so I finally gave in and I don't smoke in the house and it's been helping me stop smoking so much.

DOCTOR X620
Yeah enough so you have to go outside.

PATIENT X620
Right.

DOCTOR X620
Especially in the winter. 

PATIENT X620
Right.

DOCTOR X620
Um the only other thing that I wanted to do is just recheck your cholesterol for you know a cholesterol screen, mostly just a standard issue.  Um and then repeat a chem. panel which looks at your kidneys and your sugar, electrolytes, those sorts of things just for you know kidney disease, diabetes screening, that sort of thing.  Uh but that's just lab work that can be done any time either today or whenever, there's nothing urgent about it.

PATIENT X620
Well if you give it to me while I'm here I might as well do it you know.

DOCTOR X620
Uh let's see and then I think the only other thing that xxx Brown wanted me to do for you, honestly at this point I'm not even worried about the back pain.

PATIENT X620
Well see, I don't know a lot of people say that, my wife, you know she's a nurse @@@ she say that you can't get sick when you take the flu shot but I took the flu shot three times and every time I got sick.

DOCTOR X620
So you don't get the flu from the flu shot cause it's a killed virus.

PATIENT X620
That's what my wife says.

DOCTOR X620
If you get sick when you do get it because what is in the flu shot, a part of it immunizing your body against getting the real flu, it still has parts of a killed virus that act against your immune system.  You get an immune system response and what it is; you know when you have a sore throat from some viral illness.

PATIENT X620
Yeah.

DOCTOR X620
Or what have you the infection itself is actually for better or worse it's not what causes all those symptoms we get when we're sick, it's your body's immune system.

PATIENT X620
Fighting it off.

DOCTOR X620
Exactly and so it's sort of you to not die from a respiratory infection your body says to the system well you still feel like crap.

PATIENT X620
Right.

DOCTOR X620
You know and sort of a give and take and so what happens is yeah you get the injection and some people note kind of feeling like they have the flu afterwards and that just means you have a good immune system.  You don't actually have the flu.  You can't get other people sick.  That being said it's already April, I'm really glad for that.

PATIENT X620
Well you know what.

DOCTOR X620
If somebody has lung disease.

PATIENT X620
Right and then my wife was saying the next flu season I'm gonna take it.

DOCTOR X620
Exactly.

PATIENT X620
And then.

DOCTOR X620
Because around September, October when it comes out I'll push it.

PATIENT X620
Because I got my grandkids living with me now and I don't want you know catch something from them or give them something you know.  I got two, my oldest daughter.

DOCTOR X620
But we are gonna stick you today for um, the last time you had a tetanus shot, it looks like you just got a ten year booster.  You had it back in 2006.

PATIENT X620
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X620
Um unfortunately I guess they went ahead and did this tetanus diphtheria one.  Around 2006 they released the T-Daf, which is the tetanus, diphtheria which is like lockjaw.

PATIENT X620
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X620
It's a bad throat infection in fact it's a little more and then what they added on was something called pertussis and whooping cough.

PATIENT X620
I don't know about it.

DOCTOR X620
Yeah and so if you have anyone that got a tetanus diphtheria vaccine in 2006 and before have to repeat this just because it's a different vaccine.  So I had the same thing happen to me, I had to get two in two years.

PATIENT X620
Okay.

DOCTOR X620
I was a little upset about it but you know it's all to help out plus if you hang around any elderly people or children you know whooping cough affects them much worse than it does an adult.  

PATIENT X620
I got a 4-year-old and a 7-year-old and as old as I am this is not something.

DOCTOR X620
I know exactly.  So let me go talk to DOCTOR just to let him know what's going on and I'll come back in and let you know the plan and I think we can get you out of here okay.

PATIENT X620
Okay no problem.

DOCTOR X620
It'll be a couple minutes.

(DOCTOR OUT:  16:53   DOCTOR IN:  22:44)

DOCTOR X620
DOCTOR is good with everything.  Let me find out who is available in terms of giving you this.

PATIENT X620
Oh no problem.

DOCTOR X620
Some people @@@, just hold on.  Apparently everyone's busy.  Um what I'll do is I'll put some of this stuff in the computer real quick.

PATIENT X620
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X620
Um if you want to go over to the Lab and do the lab work today and come back that's perfectly fine or if you want to just like wait out there I'll let NAME know to call your name.

PATIENT X620
Okay.

DOCTOR X620
@@@.  And thanks so much for coming.

PATIENT X620
Oh no problem.

DOCTOR X620
I think we'll need to see you on a routine basis for a year but obviously if something comes up you can make an appointment.

PATIENT X620
Let's try to make it in six months at least.

DOCTOR X620
Okay yeah I can do it.  Um so the main thing is to go over to the Lab and get the lab work done over there.

PATIENT X620
@@@.

DOCTOR X620
So it'll be non-opiate medication just because you don't want to with the cocaine and the urine drops um so it'll be a medicine called @@@ I don't know if you've ever taken it before.  Um it's a little bit stronger than Naproxen but it's not as strong as like Vicodin so it's kind of a mix @@@.

PATIENT X620
Okay.

DOCTOR X620
@@@.

PATIENT X620
@@@ they can tell that if Vicodin might help.

DOCTOR X620
No, no, no, which I and @@@.  I don't want you to @@@.  Exactly.

PATIENT X620
@@@.

DOCTOR X620
@@@.  Physical Therapy will contact you.  @@@ the Prosthetics Office and you can pick up the knee brace.

PATIENT X620

PATIENT X620

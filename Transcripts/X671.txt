I'm DOCTOR.  Nice to meet you.

PATIENT X671
Same to you.  I just getting ready to pop out of here.

DOCTOR X671
Oh really?

PATIENT X671
You just called me then.

DOCTOR X671
This is my conference room.

PATIENT X671
Alright.

DOCTOR X671
How you feeling today?

PATIENT X671
Oh I'm alright.

DOCTOR X671
Good.

PATIENT X671
I guess.

DOCTOR X671
As good as you can be huh.

PATIENT X671
Yeah it's always something.

DOCTOR X671
So how's your diabetes?

PATIENT X671
Well um it was high this morning cause uh I had something I wasn't supposed to have but I had a craving.

DOCTOR X671
I see.

PATIENT X671
And I had some fish and fries so it was 156 this morning.

DOCTOR X671
Oh okay.  Are you just taking the glyburide for your diabetes?

PATIENT X671
Who?

DOCTOR X671
Glyburide is that the only medication you're taking?

PATIENT X671
No I'm taking that and uh they changed uh, they took me off the adda, started with a uh, something that was supposed to have been pulled off the market.

DOCTOR X671
Actos.

PATIENT X671
I think that's what it was and put me on this new started with a p, propanol.

DOCTOR X671
Pioglitazone?

PATIENT X671
I think so.

DOCTOR X671
Cause it's not in any of your uh.

PATIENT X671
I get them refilled.

DOCTOR X671
Where do you get it from?

PATIENT X671
Here.  I just got it refilled.  I'm gonna start taking it now.

DOCTOR X671
You're on the glyburide that's all I can see that you're on.

PATIENT X671
No I'm sure.  I take two for high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X671
Rosiglitazone?

PATIENT X671
And two, who?

DOCTOR X671
Rosiglitazone?

PATIENT X671
That might be it.  I take two for diabetes and two for high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X671
No you're on the pioglitazone that's what you're on.

PATIENT X671
That's the P.

DOCTOR X671
Yeah.

PATIENT X671
There we go.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.  Um yeah when checked your A1c last month it was perfect, you were right on target at 7 so that's good.  That's where we want you, that or below.

PATIENT X671
Okay.

DOCTOR X671
So that's good.  What are your sugars normally then when you're not giving in to your cravings?

PATIENT X671
Um well actually I took it twice yesterday cause um, yeah yesterday, cause the nurse came it in the afternoon, that was about 4 and it was 71.  She said you need to eat.

DOCTOR X671
Yeah.

PATIENT X671
So uh I kind of over did it, it was 156 this morning.

DOCTOR X671
Could you feel it, did you feel the 71 or did you?

PATIENT X671
Not really.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.  Do you check your sugars in the morning?

PATIENT X671
Usually every morning but I'm up at 3 o'clock.

DOCTOR X671
Oh.

PATIENT X671
Cause I have to be here at 5:30.

DOCTOR X671
Oh okay.

PATIENT X671
I work for CWT Police Department.

DOCTOR X671
Oh I see.

PATIENT X671
It's just a temporary thing.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.

PATIENT X671
But uh.

DOCTOR X671
So what do your sugars run then?

PATIENT X671
They staying low, under 100.

DOCTOR X671
Usually under 100.

PATIENT X671
I should have brought my machine; I knew I forgot something this morning.

DOCTOR X671
Do they ever go below 70?  

PATIENT X671
In.

DOCTOR X671
They do?

PATIENT X671
Once in a blue moon.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.  But do you ever get periods where you feel really shaky, clammy, sweaty, anything like that?

PATIENT X671
Once in a while.

DOCTOR X671
How often?

PATIENT X671
That's cause I'm trying to really cut down and uh you know on the amount I eat but um.

DOCTOR X671
Well if that's the case then we need to be careful with your glucose and the medicine you're taking for your diabetes.  I mean and you have lost, you've lost about 20 pounds.

PATIENT X671
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X671
Since March, that's excellent.

PATIENT X671
Thank you.  It's a start.

DOCTOR X671
It's a great start.

PATIENT X671
I've got 70 more to go.  I got to get under 200.

DOCTOR X671
Well if you get down that low you probably won't even need anything if you lose that much weight.

PATIENT X671
Right.

DOCTOR X671
And your blood pressure looks great today.  Um my only concern is that if you're not eating as much as you should be, what I would say to you is that the glyburide can be decreased caused that's the one that's going to drop your sugar the lowest.

PATIENT X671
That's them little blue pills right?

DOCTOR X671
I don't know what they look like.

PATIENT X671
Oblong.

DOCTOR X671
It's the one that you take two tablets.

PATIENT X671
Yeah.

DOCTOR X671
Twice a day.

PATIENT X671
That's the blue one yeah.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.  So here's what I'll say to you about that if you know, like what meals are you skipping out on?

PATIENT X671
Breakfast.

DOCTOR X671
Breakfast is the one?  Then what you could do is just take one tablet of glyburide in the morning, actually let me take that back.  You can take one tablet of glyburide at night cause it's that dose that's gonna affect your morning sugars the most.  So what we can do is actually just peel back and just do 10 in the morning, since you take two tablets and just do one of that at night and we'll see how it goes.

PATIENT X671
It gets low in the morning.

DOCTOR X671
Yeah.  If you're noticing that consistently for a couple of days, they're running pretty well like if you're in the low 70 or even 80s then just take one at night.  Cause normal blood sugars in the morning is between 90 to 120, that's really the range we want you in.  Um so if it's anything lower than that, then maybe we should just try the 5 mg okay.

PATIENT X671
It's not a consistent thing so I'll just check.  You know maybe I should check it more than once a day.

DOCTOR X671
You could check it maybe one time after another meal, two hours after a meal or right before dinner or something like that.  Um I mean if you're consistent below 100 on your sugars then maybe we should just cut you back to 5 mg at night um because the only thing is.  I mean if you do that and you start noticing your sugars are going up to 140s, 150s then you can go back to taking the two tablets but um.  You know my concern is I don't want you to become hypoglycemic where you're running too low cause that's actually a little bit more of a concern than if they're too high.

PATIENT X671
That's what I heard.  Yeah.

DOCTOR X671
So why don't we actually do that.  Why don't you just cut back to 5 mg at night okay?

PATIENT X671
You're not going to change the prescriptions?

DOCTOR X671
Um no I'm just telling you and.

PATIENT X671
Okay.

DOCTOR X671
I'll write it down for you if you need me to.

PATIENT X671
No I got it.

DOCTOR X671
You got it.

PATIENT X671
Yes I got it.

DOCTOR X671
Alright, um any other concerns or issues?

PATIENT X671
Um.

DOCTOR X671
Ortho was trying to catch you too so.

PATIENT X671
I um, yeah I still have this cough.  It's not as bad as it used to be but uh I still have this cough uh and the doctor had said a few years ago that I had this acid built-up thing.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X671
And uh.

DOCTOR X671
Is it a dry cough?

PATIENT X671
Yeah.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.  Is it getting worse, the same, better?

PATIENT X671
It flares up, ever since, it flares up every once in a while but I don't know exactly what's causing it.  You know like I'm a Buddhist so I burn incense in the morning.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X671
If I breathe in the incense you know I begin to cough.  Um after I eat something like crackers or something like that uh, it's kind of like a choking cough; you know what I'm saying?  It's not a cold cough or.

DOCTOR X671
Sure.

PATIENT X671
I don't know how to explain it.

DOCTOR X671
Well that kind of sounds more of like an allergic reaction or um like an irritant so the incense, the smoke in and of itself can be an irritant to the back of your throat and that's when you kind of have that like, kind of almost a violent cough cause your body's trying to expel it um but um I mean you're on the ranitidine for acid reflux.  Are you still taking that?  Its 150 mg you take at bedtime.

PATIENT X671
No I haven't taken that in a while.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.

PATIENT X671
They was killing me with these charges so I just uh you know I don't want to owe nothing but I haven't taken it in a while.  Maybe I should start back on it, I don't know.

DOCTOR X671
You can try.  Did you notice any improvement when you were taking it?

PATIENT X671
Some yeah.

DOCTOR X671
Yeah.  I mean, acid is a real irritant to the back of the throat too um so it could definitely be contributing.

PATIENT X671
Okay.  I'm just about out of prescription wise on some of those medications but I, I know that one that starts with a P I had to call over here and I had to go and take a blood test to get it re uh.

DOCTOR X671
Oh yeah you have six refills on that now.

PATIENT X671
Okay.

DOCTOR X671
Let's see what some of these are.  Do you still use that um betamethasone which is like um a steroid cream for your skin?  Are you still requiring that at all?

PATIENT X671
No.  One of them was real good but I can't remember which one it was now.  I just can't remember which one that really worked better than all of them but I can't remember which one it was.  The dermatologist prescribed it.  I was trying to think of what it was so.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.  Do you still have it at home?

PATIENT X671
No.

DOCTOR X671
It hasn't been refilled in a long time.  What are you using it for?  What was the ointment for?

PATIENT X671
I had a rash on my uh, one on each leg inside here back here and then I came back in the Emergency Room cause I had a real bad uh, well I got a torn ligament here.  You know about that right?

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X671
And it still bothering me.  But something happened to my right leg up in here and uh they gave me some, something like xxx Gay.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh @@@.

PATIENT X671
And some pills.  Oh you know what, before I forget all that, uh I got real, real sick here about a month ago.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X671
And I woke up.  I had some yogurt and some fruit and I went to bed and uh at Tuesday morning, cause I was off that Tuesday, I had the worst stomach ache I've ever had and I started, I didn't eat for three, four days.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X671
Then I started back with uh oatmeal you know and but when I did finally go to the washroom, my stool was black.

DOCTOR X671
Hmm.

PATIENT X671
And yesterday I noticed it was real dark also.  I don't know what it was.  I didn't come to the doctor.

DOCTOR X671
Sounds like an ulcer.  Are you, what are you taking?  Do you take any ibuprofen or is it from the aspirin, baby aspirin?

PATIENT X671
Um I take the baby aspirin now.  The doctor told me to cut down, the doctor said to cut down to 81 cause I was taking 325 at night.

DOCTOR X671
Yeah.

PATIENT X671
81 um but uh and my urine was orange on a couple of mornings.  This was a month or so ago.  Now it's like lemonade probably in color.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.

PATIENT X671
But uh I don't know what happened but uh you know.

DOCTOR X671
It sounds like an ulcer um that probably got irritated and bled and that's what caused your dark stools.  Um have you ever had a scope where they take a look into your stomach?

PATIENT X671
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X671
So I mean that's kind of what it sounds like and that's what the point of the actually instead of the ranitidine I'd probably use something else um, it's a little stronger for acid suppression.

PATIENT X671
Oh just thinking about them going down my nose, oh.

DOCTOR X671
It's down your throat actually but you'll be sedated, you would be sedated if they do that test.

PATIENT X671
Oh, I'm fine.

DOCTOR X671
You don't want that?

PATIENT X671
@@@.

DOCTOR X671
I mean that's kind of what it sounds like so what we could do um is also start on that PPI and we'll give you omeprazole um so you can take that once a day and what I can do is check you for this bacteria called H. pylori that can sometimes happen in the stomach um and also it can create ulcers in your stomach actually um and if you do have H. pylori it's very treatable.  You just take a course of antibiotics for two weeks um and that'll knock it out.  Because those things, that bacteria can be really irritating on the stomach and actually cause ulcers so it's good to, um if you have it to treat it because otherwise if you kind of let it fester for years and years and years then what can happen eventually it can cause a type of cancer in the stomach.  So it'd be good to figure out if you have it or not.

PATIENT X671
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X671
And all of that is that it requires you to um, it just requires you to send in a stool sample, that's the best test that we have to see if you have it.  So what you can do is you can go to the Lab and we'll get you the container that you need to put your stool in and then.  Can you sit up there for me?  So what are you doing to lose weight?  You said you've been cutting back on things? Are you exercising?

PATIENT X671
Um not really.  I'm uh, I was going to a gym but uh then I got hurt at that gym.  You want me to take this off?

DOCTOR X671
No that's okay; you can just take your glasses off for me if you could.

PATIENT X671
I got hurt at that gym.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.  

PATIENT X671
That's how I tore my ligament again.  

DOCTOR X671
Oh I see.  Do you swim at all?

PATIENT X671
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X671
Say ah.

PATIENT X671
Ah.

DOCTOR X671
Have you ever noticed bright red blood in your stool or is it just the dark stools?

PATIENT X671
And this was uh oh it was a month or two ago.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X671
When I had that stomach thing.

DOCTOR X671
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X671
And I finally went to bed then I think it was last night.

DOCTOR X671
You had another episode?

PATIENT X671
Looked dark to me but I had had some mustard and turnip greens for lunch too.

DOCTOR X671
Okay.

PATIENT X671
I don't know if that was it or not, you know it could've been.  

DOCTOR X671
Deep breath.  Go ahead and lay back for me for a second.  I just want to listen to your lungs.  

PATIENT X671
Anyway you @@@.

DOCTOR X671
If only I'd be a rich woman.

PATIENT X671
@@@.

DOCTOR X671
Any pain in here at all?

PATIENT X671
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X671
No pain in here now?

PATIENT X671
Uh uh. 

DOCTOR X671
You can sit up.  

PATIENT X671
How long are you going to be here now?

DOCTOR X671
I will be here until um June of next year.  You know what we were gonna get on you last time was your blood count, why didn't they do that?  You were 11.8 a year ago.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X671
Yeah.

DOCTOR X671
Hmm.  The problem is your, you are anemic cause your blood count was low and the MCV which is one of the numbers that we look at tells me that you may be a little bit iron deficient and typically if you're iron deficient and you're anemic that means you're having some form of blood loss from your GI tract.  So it's a little, the thing is you developed this anemia after you had the colonoscopy in 2007 and iron studies, your iron was a little bit low but the rest of the labs looked okay.  

PATIENT X671
I was all uh, always borderline.

DOCTOR X671
You were.

PATIENT X671
Yeah I was always borderline uh I don't eat a lot of meat.  The last check was B12 and whatever.

DOCTOR X671
Yeah I guess your blood levels have been pretty stable for the past five years.  The meat aspect could definitely do it too okay.  So what I would say is, could we get a repeat of your blood count today?  Would that be possible here next week sometime?

PATIENT X671
What have my shot or what?

DOCTOR X671
Yeah just the blood tests, from the Lab.

PATIENT X671
I ain't ate so so I guess I'm still under the passing thing.

DOCTOR X671
Well that's fine; it's the kind you don't need to be fasting.

PATIENT X671
Oh.

DOCTOR X671
So that'll actually be fine.  Um so I'll put it in and then you can get that done and pick up the stool cup too.

PATIENT X671
Okay.

DOCTOR X671
So give me just a minute, let me put in the omeprazole for you.

PATIENT X671
So the medicine I'm on is cool right?

DOCTOR X671
Which one?

PATIENT X671
Uh all of them.

DOCTOR X671
Yeah the only one I'm changing is the acid reflux one; I'm changing it to a different type of an acid reflux medication that's a little stronger.

PATIENT X671
Take it at night too?

DOCTOR X671
That one you can take in the morning before you eat, like half an hour before you eat.

PATIENT X671
Is that the one that look like a little capsule?

DOCTOR X671
I don't know what they look like to be honest.  People ask me that all the time, I have no idea what the medication looks like.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X671
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  51:19  DOCTOR IN:  54:50)

(Patient makes the statement "Yeah you make a note cause I know you listening but this is the prettiest doctor I have ever been to.")

DOCTOR X671
Alrighty.  So I put in for that omeprazole at the Pharmacy if you are able to pick that up today.

PATIENT X671
Hmm.

DOCTOR X671
And then if you don't mind just going to the Lab to draw your blood and get that stool um and then just remember the glyburide, your diabetes medication to take one pill at night instead of the two.

PATIENT X671
Okay.

DOCTOR X671
Okay and I want to see you back in three months.  If you notice that you're having more frequent dark stools like you had a month ago you need to come in and we need to have GI see you cause that means that you're having some ongoing bleeding from your stomach or somewhere in your upper GI tracts okay.

PATIENT X671
Alright.

DOCTOR X671
I know it doesn't sound pleasant to have that procedure done but it's actually quicker than a colonoscopy um and they sedate you for that as well.

PATIENT X671
One is just as bad as the other.

DOCTOR X671
I know but I just don't want you bleeding, continue to bleed from your stomach okay.

PATIENT X671
Okay.

DOCTOR X671
Sound good?

PATIENT X671
Yeah.

DOCTOR X671
Alright.

PATIENT X671
Do you have any callers?

DOCTOR X671
I don't.  I @@@ at home.  I @@@.

PATIENT X671
So how am I gonna be able to reach you without going through that computer you know if I have to?

DOCTOR X671
The best way to do it is to sort of call one of the nurses here in the Gold Clinic and then they pass those messages along to us.  Cause I'm usually not actually at the VAMC, I'm over at UNC so um the best way is when they page me and let me know that you want to talk to me.

PATIENT X671
Okay.

DOCTOR X671
And that's it, alright.

PATIENT X671
Okie dokie.

DOCTOR X671
Very nice meeting you.

PATIENT X671
Nice meeting you.  Doc you have a good day.

DOCTOR X671
Thank you, you too.

PATIENT X671
@@@.

DOCTOR X13
PATIENT?

PATIENT X13
Oh, oh you wanna fight?

DOCTOR X13
No, (laughter).  @@@, yeah that's @@@.

PATIENT X13
You better be good to me or I will end up.

DOCTOR X13
Let's see, yes you can.  I apologize for that, I didn't mean it to be such a public thing.

PATIENT X13  
I didn't either, ha, ha.  Sit here?

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.  You mainly see DOCTOR?

PATIENT X13
Right.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.  Do you know why you're here today?  You're in the hospital @@@.

PATIENT X13
I work in the hospital.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.  How have been sick?

PATIENT X13  
Fine.

DOCTOR X13
Do you walk?  Sounds like your heart was beating fast.

PATIENT X13
Right.

DOCTOR X13
Uh, they started you at base, increased some of your medicines and started you on . . .

PATIENT X13
They changed some medicines too and that's what I want to talk to you about.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.  So let's take a look at the medicines and then you can tell me your questions.  Looks like you're on Coumadin, which is new.

PATIENT X13  
Right.

DOCTOR X13
A blood thinner.

PATIENT X13
So it's not new.  I was on it before @@@ and I was taken off of it.

DOCTOR X13
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X13
Now I'm back on it.

DOCTOR X13
Okay and then um digoxin. 

PATIENT X13  
They put me on that at @@@ Hospital.

DOCTOR X13
And then a water pill, Lasix, furosemide.  

PATIENT X13
Yep.

DOCTOR X13
Metoprolol?

PATIENT X13
Right, taking it while I was in the hospital.

DOCTOR X13
And then isosorbide mononitrate?

PATIENT X13  
Yep.

DOCTOR X13
And then @@@.


PATIENT X13
Yeah.

DOCTOR X13
Lisinopril?

PATIENT X13
Yes half a pill in the morning, half in the afternoon and half in the evening.

DOCTOR X13
Magnesium?

PATIENT X13  
Yes.

DOCTOR X13
Diltiazem?

PATIENT X13
Yes.

DOCTOR X13
And then B12 shots.

PATIENT X13
Right.

DOCTOR X13
And then glipizide.

PATIENT X13  
Glipizide which I'm almost out of, which is doing absolutely no good.

DOCTOR X13
Cause your sugars are high?

PATIENT X13
Yeah.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13
They took me off of.

DOCTOR X13
Metformin?

PATIENT X13  
Metformin and uh gluco.

DOCTOR X13
@@@.

PATIENT X13
Glucophage.

DOCTOR X13
It's because of your kidneys um.  Your kidney function is not normal anymore and metformin is actually dangerous in people with kidney functions that were not normal so that's probably why.

PATIENT X13
Oh.

DOCTOR X13
And then they didn't, you know, give you something to kinda help with the diabetes so.

PATIENT X13  
Right.

DOCTOR X13
Um.

PATIENT X13
And the glipizide is not doing it.

DOCTOR X13
You're taking 10 mg twice a day.  That's the maximum dose actually so.  Have you ever taken anything else for your diabetes?

PATIENT X13
Well uh, let me think it's so many years ago.  Uh, the metformin and the Glucophage are @@@.

DOCTOR X13
What's your blood, what's your blood sugar now?

PATIENT X13  
Well in the morning it's been as much as 150-160.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13
In the evening it's around 290.

DOCTOR X13
Wow.  That's pretty high.

PATIENT X13
Yeah and I had perfect control with the . . .

DOCTOR X13
The metformin.

PATIENT X13  
With the metformin.

DOCTOR X13
It's just that it's very dangerous with your renal function so we have to figure out something to help you out.  Now were you having heart failure when you came in, swelling in your legs, anything like that?

PATIENT X13
Well I had some little swelling in my right ankle and I wear elastic stockings for that.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13
That seems to control it.

DOCTOR X13
Let's see cause we're kind of limited by what we can give you by mouth um.  There's one medication that we can try um but it's associated with swelling in the legs and you were here last time with a little bit of heart failure and so if I give you that medicine.

PATIENT X13  
I didn't have heart failure I had a high pulse.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah it sounded like when DOCTOR wrote the sign-off note for you she mentioned that you had a little bit.  So we can try that medication and if you start noticing that you're swelling in your legs gets out of control then um perhaps we can try a different medicine.  Cause, so there's only, metformin is the best medication for diabetes.  Next is the glipizide that you're taking now um and then the other ones are just AOK and then the next step would be insulin but that's you know that's a big hassle, a big lifestyle change.

PATIENT X13
Right.

DOCTOR X13
And we want to try to avoid that.

PATIENT X13
Yeah I do too.

DOCTOR X13
So, yeah we can try you on this new medication and it's called pioglitazone um.  The side, the main side effect is swelling in the legs okay, which I'm kind of worried but um we can try that okay.  Uh let's see what's the last time DOCTOR checked your diabetes @@@.

PATIENT X13 
Uh-huh.
 
DOCTOR X13
The last time your control was actually really good and that was in the beginning of November but if you're telling me your blood sugars have been high we should . . .

PATIENT X13
Well that, the blood sugars are that high since they took me off of the metformin.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah I understand that.  Okay, we'll try this new medication and then, and then see how your sugars improve okay.

PATIENT X13
Okay.

DOCTOR X13
Um if anything um maybe DOCTOR just wanted to start you on a little booster, one time a day, of insulin instead of you know.  Cause insulin is done multiple ways.  But let's try this one medication and then to help okay.  So that's one thing your diabetes.  Um, your heart rate today is well controlled; it was @@@, so that's good.  I think all the medications they put you on um helped that.  Um how often do you @@@?

PATIENT X13  
Feel fine.

DOCTOR X13
You feel good?

PATIENT X13
Yeah.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.  Um, so we'll get some blood work today to check all of that stuff again.  I know you got some about two weeks ago.

PATIENT X13
That Coumadin is.

DOCTOR X13
Sticker right?

PATIENT X13  
@@@.

DOCTOR X13
@@@.  It does that.  It thins your blood you know.  It prevents strokes that's the thing so.  Um alright.  Any other questions about the medications?  What else you got?

PATIENT X13
Well, I don't know yet the effect of the other medications cause I haven't been on them that long.

DOCTOR X13
Okay, so do you want to discuss, I mean kind of ask me questions like before, do you want me to @@@ like that?

PATIENT X13
Well uh I know most of them are for the uh.

DOCTOR X13
The heart rate.

PATIENT X13  
The heart rate.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.

PATIENT X13
Yeah.

DOCTOR X13
The only thing is your blood pressure is a little high but I'll recheck it today.  Does your blood pressure get a little more on the high side?

PATIENT X13
It must.  @@@ and almost all my life, it's been in the upper readings.  It's been around 140-150.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13  
And the lower reading has always been in the low 60s, that's what diastolic, in the low 60s, but the same reason that I've had a high pulse without realizing it for maybe 16 years.

DOCTOR X13
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X13
You know I just noticed it when I go in the stores and I checked it at the store machine which shows a high pulse of 90, 100.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.

PATIENT X13
90s, 100s.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.

PATIENT X13  
In that area.

DOCTOR X13
The thing is um, they both are you know connected.  The fact that you've had your blood pressure on the little higher side for so long, your heart structurally the muscle pump at a higher blood pressure and so the muscles, over time, stretch, over like say the you know before you get the high high blood pressure.  So the more the muscles stretch and then, so the inner connections are loose and hence your heart beats faster.

PATIENT X13
But I never, I've never had high blood pressure until ten years ago.

DOCTOR X13
Oh ten years ago?

PATIENT X13
Maybe not even that long ago.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.  So I think the key to preventing your heart, well you're hearts already in that faster rhythm, but controlling your blood pressure is key.  We can still go up on the lisinopril.

PATIENT X13  
Well I took lisinopril I'd say about 16 years or 20 years ago, back when I started on @@@.

DOCTOR X13
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X13
And uh when I was taking more of a dose than I'm taking now, which is a half a tablet in the morning, half in the evening uh I, my lisinopril causes my potassium to go up.

DOCTOR X13
I see.

PATIENT X13
So I don't know if you want to increase the lisinopril and automatically increase.

DOCTOR X13
Then your potassium goes high.  You're very right, you're very right.  Um well other things, the other thing is we'll just go up on, will just raise, make your heart rate go down even more and at this point, your heart rate is pretty low so.  We don't want to drop it too low.

PATIENT X13  
No I don't want to drop it too low either.

DOCTOR X13
So that doesn't make @@@.  Um, let's see.  We can go up on the water pill, the furosemide.  Go up to twice a day.  It makes you pee, you probably know that.

PATIENT X13
I do that anyhow.

DOCTOR X13
But the, the main thing is because your potassium tends to be on the higher side, so the furosemide actually drops your potassium so maybe that can counteract a little bit.  So maybe we'll go, would you rather take twice the dose in the morning or would you rather split it in two doses throughout the day?

PATIENT X13
Take em through the day.

DOCTOR X13
@@@ okay.  Let's do it twice a day then.

PATIENT X13  
Okay.

DOCTOR X13
I think it's more effective @@@.

PATIENT X13
Okay I am almost out of glipizide because . . .

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13
I got pills left.

DOCTOR X13
Cool, alright.  You need that too.  Okay, you want to come up here?  How about @@@.  I'll just have you come back for blood work in about two weeks.

PATIENT X13  
I've gotta come back for blood work on December 9th.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13
For the Coumadin check.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13
So do want to do it then?

DOCTOR X13
Let's do it then, yep, yeah let's do it all then.  I think is good.

PATIENT X13  
That's only six days from today.

DOCTOR X13
Do you want to pick up the new pill downstairs or do you want to mail it?

PATIENT X13
@@@ they mail it takes about four days.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.

PATIENT X13
Well I have enough for a week.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.  So the furosemide you just double it.  Just take one in the morning and one at night until we.

PATIENT X13  
Will they mark that on the prescription?

DOCTOR X13
Oh yeah when you get it yeah.

PATIENT X13
Okay.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.  I can write it down for you if you want.  

PATIENT X13
Right.

DOCTOR X13
Do you have your med list?

PATIENT X13  
Furosemide twice a day.

DOCTOR X13
Here, your med list is right here.  I'll just mark it on here.

PATIENT X13
You got your notes on that; don't you want to keep those?

DOCTOR X13
No there up here, so it's good.

PATIENT X13
Oh.

DOCTOR X13
Change to twice a day.  Okay um and then I'll send the new diabetic medication then too.

PATIENT X13  
Okay.

DOCTOR X13
You can start that today.

PATIENT X13
So if I get started today I'll stop and pick it up right?

DOCTOR X13
Um exactly.

PATIENT X13
Yeah.

DOCTOR X13
So I'll send it.  I @@@.

PATIENT X13  
Do I take that new diabetic medicine at night or in the morning, when?

DOCTOR X13
Take it in the morning.

PATIENT X13
Just once a day.

DOCTOR X13
Yes, once a day.  I'll be right back okay?

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:53  DOCTOR IN: 40:44)

DOCTOR X13
Deep breath please.  @@@.  @@@ okay thank you.  You're heart @@@ today so.

PATIENT X13
Oh.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.  The Coumadin.

PATIENT X13  
That's what drives me nuts.

DOCTOR X13
Okay.

PATIENT X13
@@@.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah you know the Coumadin is one of the downfalls of medicine.  It works because it does what we need it to, which is prevent stroke but.

PATIENT X13
Yeah.

DOCTOR X13
But the complications of bleeding and like you know so difficult to monitor.

PATIENT X13  
Oh it's terrible.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah so I mean.

PATIENT X13
@@@.

DOCTOR X13
So but once you start getting more control I think it's the management that @@@ once you get more regular.  I think you're in that early period where.

PATIENT X13
Well I was in the @@@ for six years.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X13
And they took me off of it because my echocardiogram was perfect and my uh, the EKG was perfect and the heart beat was perfect and everything.  Then I went off of it for a month @@@.
  
DOCTOR X13
Yeah.  Let me look at the dose then.  @@@.  So once a day.

PATIENT X13
Should I watch for swelling in the legs or what?

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.  So if you start noticing increased swelling in the legs give me a call or give DOCTOR a call and then we'll have to come up with other options.  @@@.

PATIENT X13
Well I don't, because @@@ swelling and just.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah massive swelling.

PATIENT X13  
Oh.

DOCTOR X13
Yeah.  

PATIENT X13
I don't know that I didn't want to take that.

DOCTOR X13
Well it doesn't, you know it's just about maybe 10% of people get it, so.  The majority of the time it doesn't happen.

PATIENT X13
Okay.

DOCTOR X13
Or happens in a small amount.  Alright I'll be right back okay sir, I'm going to talk to my attending and uh I'll be right with you okay?

PATIENT X13

DOCTOR X13
Alright sir.  So actually that water pill, my attending wanted just to do it once a day to make it easier for you.

PATIENT X13
So what I'm taking.

DOCTOR X13
So at a higher dose but just once a day.

PATIENT X13

PATIENT X13

DOCTOR X13

PATIENT X13
Okay but what do I do about the glipizide?  I'll pick up another.

DOCTOR X13

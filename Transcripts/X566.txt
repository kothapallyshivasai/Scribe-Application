DOCTOR X566
PATIENT?  Hi sir you can take a seat over here.

PATIENT X566
Okay.  How are you today?

DOCTOR X566
Good, good.  Sorry to see that you got scheduled to the wrong clinic today.

PATIENT X566
Whoa oh.

DOCTOR X566
@@@ on Thursday.

PATIENT X566
Yeah I usually come in on Thursdays.

DOCTOR X566
Yeah so that's what was going on today.  They just scheduled a bunch of people.  Um I went through your chart and it looks like you were supposed to have your cholesterol and your labs done but you haven't had them done.

PATIENT X566
Right.

DOCTOR X566
Um why didn't you go up to get your labs done?

PATIENT X566
Nobody ever told me to go and get them done.

DOCTOR X566
Um back in July when they saw you they asked you to come back in two days and get your labs done.

PATIENT X566
I got them done back in July.

DOCTOR X566
Okay cause I looked at them and I didn't see any.  I think I'll just check one more time.

PATIENT X566
Last time I was here yeah.

DOCTOR X566
I saw the last one in June but not from July yeah.  So they weren't done since June.

PATIENT X566
Okay then that was, they only told me to go one time.

DOCTOR X566
Yeah.

PATIENT X566
Okay so @@@.

DOCTOR X566
You're just here for a follow-up appointment?

PATIENT X566
A follow-up plus I'm having some problems.

DOCTOR X566
Okay what's your problems?

PATIENT X566
Okay uh my I've got a toe on my, I guess I need to be referred to Podiatry.  I've got a toe on my right foot that if I don't work on it at least every three or four days I can barely walk.

DOCTOR X566
Does it hurt?

PATIENT X566
Yes.

DOCTOR X566
Is it ingrown?

PATIENT X566
No it's the nail when it starts to grow out.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.  Try to put your here and let me take a look at you.

PATIENT X566
Ever since '79 in the snow.  I was out in the snow and the nail turned black and it never.

DOCTOR X566
Okay which toe is it?

PATIENT X566
It's next to the baby toe.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
So I don't know what toe that is.

DOCTOR X566
Let me look.

PATIENT X566
But that's why of course back in June I told them that it felt like had pulled a muscle in my elbow or something.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And it was hard for me to lift but I had an elastic band on my elbow.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And now if I don't put a band around my elbow I can't lift any more than about four or five pounds and it feels like the tendon is about to tear from the bone or something.

DOCTOR X566
Your blood pressure looks good.  Okay let me see.

PATIENT X566
This toe.  There's a big callus there and when this nail grows out I can barely walk.  

DOCTOR X566
It hurts?

PATIENT X566
It does when it grows out if I don't work on it like every two or three days it's unbearable.  And then I've got a question.  I've been working for I guess about the last month removing mold and painting a basement.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And the past week I've been really out of breath and my chest has been hurting.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
I guess from the fumes whatever. 

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
Is there anything I could put like in a.

DOCTOR X566
So you're being @@@?

PATIENT X566
Yeah well they had water damage so I tore out all the mold and redid this stuff and I've been painting and cleaning and stuff and I guess the fumes just might, like I say for about the last week my chest has been hurting and I been out of breath so I thought maybe if there's something I could put on the inhaler or something that.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
Maybe.

DOCTOR X566
Okay so does your chest pain only occur while you're getting short of breath?  How does it happen?

PATIENT X566
No I can, I mean I get short of breath now, some like just now bending over uh.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And this is so back in June I was getting out of breath and if I go to exercise or do sit-ups or stuff I get dizzy.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
Okay I thought that was the blood work was to find out if something was wrong there but now it's uh like I'll go to sleep at night and all of a sudden I start having real bad chest pains.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
Or I'll get up and.

DOCTOR X566
How long has this been going on for?

PATIENT X566
This is, the chest pain for about a week now.

DOCTOR X566
A week okay and how long have you been working in the basement for?

PATIENT X566
Uh about a month, month and a half.

DOCTOR X566
And I saw that you were using cocaine.  Have you used any recently?

PATIENT X566
No.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.  When was your last use?

PATIENT X566
Uh probably June or July.

DOCTOR X566
June or July okay.

PATIENT X566
About that time.

DOCTOR X566
Cause you know the habits of cocaine use it can actually make you have heart attacks.

PATIENT X566
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X566
So.

PATIENT X566
But this doesn't feel like a heart attack, it's almost like somebody punched me in the chest.  It's like; it feels like I'm having pain in my lungs.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
You know I thought maybe if I got an inhaler and maybe put some Vicks on there or something.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
That I can inhaler could.

DOCTOR X566
Uh does the pain occur while you're sleeping?

PATIENT X566
Sometimes it's while sleeping, sometimes I walk to the store and all of a sudden my chest will start hurting.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.  How long does it last for?

PATIENT X566
Uh maybe oh half hour, hour.

DOCTOR X566
Half hour and you have problems breathing while that happens?

PATIENT X566
Yeah I get short of breath but you know sometimes I can.

DOCTOR X566
@@@.

PATIENT X566
Cough and some white stuff will come out you know and then it feels better.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
So I thought maybe I'd inhaled too much paint or too much of the chemicals I was using to get off the.

DOCTOR X566
Does anything make it better, the pain?

PATIENT X566
Uh fresh air.

DOCTOR X566
Fresh air okay and then does anything uh make it worse?

PATIENT X566
When I get too hot, you know the apartment's too hot.

DOCTOR X566
Does exercising make it worse or better?

PATIENT X566
I haven't been able to exercise cause I go to exercise and I get, I'm getting so dizzy.

DOCTOR X566
So @@@ pains you stop walking or do you keep walking?

PATIENT X566
Yeah, yeah I stop.

DOCTOR X566
Does the pain get better if you stop walking?

PATIENT X566
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X566
And can you describe the pain?

PATIENT X566
It's as if somebody just took their fist and punched me in the chest and it's just real sore and it hurts you know.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.  Um and any nausea or sweating or anything like that?

PATIENT X566
Yeah I get nauseous.

DOCTOR X566
Did you have a stress test in the past?

PATIENT X566
I had a stress test I think back in June or July or something.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.  Was that normal?

PATIENT X566
Yeah.

DOCTOR X566
Oh okay good.

PATIENT X566
Excuse me.

DOCTOR X566
Oh that's okay.  How long have you been working on this basement for?

PATIENT X566
About a month, month and a half.

DOCTOR X566
Do you feel like the breathing is worse when you're working on it?

PATIENT X566
It I mean, you know I'm finishing up now but like I say the past week, it started about a week ago and then it started getting real bad and then I started wearing masks and I turned on a fan and opened all the windows so it's not as bad as it had gotten you know.

DOCTOR X566
Do you feel like your chest pain is associated with your problems breathing?

PATIENT X566
I think so.  You know what it kind of reminds me of once years ago uh back in the '70s when I was young I bought a building and I was trying to clean it up.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And I made the mistake I didn't know, I mixed some alcohol and some bleach together, I mean uh some ammonia and some bleach.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And I was cleaning with it and the fumes, I inhaled them and my chest started hurting and started @@@ and that's the type pain I feel you know when I have these little episodes.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
That's why I was thinking maybe it was coming from me inhaling too many chemicals.  

DOCTOR X566
Hold on one second.  (Doctor makes a phone call to check on the patient's stress test not in the computer).  Okay.  No thoughts of hurting yourself or hurting others?

PATIENT X566
Huh?

DOCTOR X566
No thoughts of hurting yourself?

PATIENT X566
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.  You're taking aspirin every day?

PATIENT X566
No.

DOCTOR X566
No?

PATIENT X566
No.

DOCTOR X566
Why not?

PATIENT X566
Uh because I wasn't told to take aspirin every day.

DOCTOR X566
You weren't?

PATIENT X566
No.

DOCTOR X566
Okay. (Doctor talking to person regarding echo report on phone)
Okay so good.  So the good news is your stress test was negative.  So I'm not too concerned that this is your heart.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

DOCTOR X566
And then can I have you sit up here while I type.  I want to take a listen to your lungs and heart okay.  Take a deep breath.  Keep your feet here.  Okay great.  Okay.  And about your elbow what did you mention first about your elbow?

PATIENT X566
Right just here.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
It's like the muscle or something like that when I lift.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
It feels like it's coming lose.  I can't lift anything.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
So I got it real tight in that one space and I wrap it and I can't even lift a five pound @@@.

DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
And it's been like this since I guess about May or June.

DOCTOR X566
Squeeze my fingers for me.  Squeeze as hard as you can.  Good.  Make two fists; go like this, good stop.  Now go like this.  Okay good.  You've got really good strength in your arm.  I'm not sure why you're not able to lift things.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

DOCTOR X566
Because I mean when I'm testing right now, you're really strong compared to other people that I know.  So it may be it's just you feel like you're a little bit weaker but you feel really strong.  I'm not sure what the problem is.

PATIENT X566
Yeah but when I, let’s say if I grab @@@.

DOCTOR X566
Does it lock?

PATIENT X566
No if I go to lift something like this, in fact this pops out like that.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And then I have to drop it.  It's something right through here.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.  Cause you have really good strength when I'm pushing down on your arm, I think having stronger muscles @@@ now right.  I wouldn't be too concerned about it.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

DOCTOR X566
I'm gonna be right back.

PATIENT X566
Okay.  Now should I go to the Lab when I leave here?

DOCTOR X566
Uh yeah probably.  I'll be right back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  73:49  DOCTOR IN:  84:00)

SECOND DOCTOR X566
PATIENT?

PATIENT X566
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT X566
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Um tell me about this chest pain.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
What does it feel like, sharp, dull, stabbing, pressure?

PATIENT X566
It's uh dull.  It's kind of like I just get hit in the chest you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And it goes away and I feel sore for a while.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
How long does it usually last you?

PATIENT X566
It lasts maybe half hour to an hour and then it goes away and my chest stays sore for a while but the actual pain itself, @@@ but it stays sore for maybe another hour or so and then it goes away.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
What are you usually doing when you get the chest pain?

PATIENT X566
Uh when it first started I'd be painting or spraying you know removing mold, whatever I was doing @@@ you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
And uh the past week it's it usually occurs when I'm at the house and you know most time it happens at night when @@@ my apartment gets too warm the pain will hit me again or if I walk to the store, walking back sometimes the pain will hit me.  Um you know I thought that perhaps I just inhaled too many fumes and too much paint and too much boric acid.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
You know bleach and stuff that I was using to clean all this mold and stuff you know so you know the pain is gradually getting better, it's not hurting as much but I thought maybe I could put something in a vaporizer or something and help clean whatever it is out.  A lot of times it hurts and I'll start coughing you know and you know phlegm or something will come up.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Well does the shortness of breath start first or chest pain start first?

PATIENT X566
The shortness of breath I get now, I assume that was from just being fat but the shortness of breath has gotten worse since this started but uh I've had the shortness of breath now for I guess six, seven months.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.  Uh so the one thing is that when you walk to the store and back you get short of breath first and then get chest pain or do you get chest pain first and then get short of breath?

PATIENT X566
The shortness of breath came first.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
The shortness of breath comes first.

PATIENT X566
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Okay.  So you're short of breath and then you get chest pain and then you rest.

PATIENT X566
Right, right.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
And it gets better.

PATIENT X566
Right uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Um does the pain move anywhere?

PATIENT X566
No it's like basically right in the middle of my chest.

SECONE DOCTOR X566
And you feel like you can't breathe in deep or that doesn't happen?

PATIENT X566
If I breathe in deep and it hurts more, sometimes I'll take a big breath.

DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
You know what I'm saying, as deep as I can take and then I'll start coughing and choking and stuff will come up.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Are you using cocaine?  When was the last time you used?

PATIENT X566
No.  The last time I used was I think back in June.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Alright.  We need some blood tests today and I also want a urine sample okay.  You did not give us one back in July; you need to give us one today okay.

PATIENT X566
Yeah okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Um you know you had that stress test.  It was a good stress test that you had done back in August or July or whenever it was a few months ago.  It did not show you had any blockages in your heart that we can see.

PATIENT X566
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Uh it's not the best test for checking to see if you have blockages but it's the next stress test.  The best test is to put a you know a catheter in your groin and go up into your heart and look to see if there's any injuries.  I think that at this point in time it's kind of a little bit invasive.

PATIENT X566
Yeah.
 
SECOND DOCTOR X566
Because it seems like I think this is more lung problem maybe than actually a cardiac heart problem.

PATIENT X566
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
So what we would like to do is we're gonna go ahead and start you on an inhaler and I want you to carry it around with you always and whenever you start getting short of breath I want you to use the inhaler.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Okay we're also going to get some blood tests done.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Are you a smoker too?

PATIENT X566
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
You're not a smoker?

PATIENT X566
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Ever?

PATIENT X566
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Never?

PATIENT X566
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Um have you had a chest x-ray recently here?

PATIENT X566
I might have had one last year or the year before.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
A year ago.

PATIENT X566
Also could you tell me how many, I know last year I had both the flu shots and this year last week I took the flu shot.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
@@@ one time, you've had the vaccine.

PATIENT X566
Yeah I know.  Have I had the pneumonia shot at all?

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Um usually we wait till you're 65 with the pneumonia shot.

PATIENT X566
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Unless you're having lung problems.

PATIENT X566
Oh okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
We're diagnosing now and if we find you have lung problems then we'll go ahead and give it to you.

PATIENT X566
Okay.  I'll just wait for you to ask.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Well I mean, have you been working in carpentry or construction for years?

PATIENT X566
No this is like a sideline and then you know I've never had problems until you know I've been working on this one for about a month, month and a half.  You know I've been around a lot of different chemicals.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
And when does your um.

PATIENT X566
The pain just started last week.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
You know you may have had this thing for a long time, could have been why your stress test was done.
 
PATIENT X566
Okay, the pain I was having was chest pain was kind of related to my heart now it feels like it's my lungs because it's just like the pressure isn't over here.  Like before I was having it felt like something was popped loose and it pushed in against my heart.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
Now this feels like it's in the middle of my chest and my lungs.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Alright, we'll get a chest x-ray and we'll do the lung tests.  You can actually go get the lung test today and do the blood work @@@ um.

PATIENT X566
Can I do it another time?

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Yeah you can come in whenever you want to do it @@@.  Uh we'll go ahead and get blood tests, get a urine sample today.  I don't want you to use any cocaine at all.  Have you used this drug before?

PATIENT X566
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Tobacco?

PATIENT X566
All I ever smoked was marijuana and cocaine.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Crack?

PATIENT X566
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
How much cocaine did you used to smoke?

PATIENT X566
I used to smoke uh during the day I'd smoke every day.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
But uh in the past I'd @@@ about six years I might of smoked maybe ten times in six years so.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
So before six years you were smoking every day?

PATIENT X566
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
For how many years?

PATIENT X566
Oh I almost @@@.  I smoked a little every day so about 15 years, 10 years, something like that.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
Okay.  Um now cocaine actually, you know just like tobacco we tell people that can actually cause lung damage, cocaine actually causes lung damage in fewer smokes.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
So that's really quite bad.  Um we'll do the lung tests and then we'll see we'll go from there but the inhaler I want you to carry around and I want you to use it whenever you get short of breath and we'll see if your symptoms are less.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X566
We'll have you come back in about a month too okay.

PATIENT X566
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Okay.  And you said you smoked cocaine for ten years or so?

PATIENT X566
I started smoking cocaine, I mean on a regular basis I was smoking for about ten years but I started smoking I think in about maybe 85.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Okay.

PATIENT X566
85 probably until 2000 on a regular basis and then the last, then I started smoking like maybe once a month but the last five years has been like maybe twice a year.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Okay.  And then before that when you said regularly was that in the 80s?

PATIENT X566
Uh for ten years it was almost every day I smoked at least ten dollars’ worth.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
But uh then I went to every weekend that I smoked a couple of hundred dollars’ worth and then finally it got to kind of where I am now where I don't even think about smoking it.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Okay.  So you're all set for your x-ray and your labs and then your lung function tests okay.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Um go ahead and go to your labs first and then go to your x-ray and then go to the lung function tests.  I would just ask them where the Pulmonary Lab is when you get your x-ray okay.  The Lab is across the hallway.  Once you're done with the labs you can go all the way down the hallway it's on the left hand side, it's X-Ray.

PATIENT X566
Okay now she said since I have to be here Wednesday morning anyway.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
Uh and I have a couple of things I'm supposed to do this evening.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X566
She said I could take the lung thing on Wednesday.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Sure that's fine too.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Okay um and then if your albuterol inhaler, I prescribed it for you, let me see maybe I should change it so you could pick it up at the window.  You can go ahead and pick that up at the window okay.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
And then we'll see you back actually pretty closely from now on okay.

PATIENT X566
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Alright and I'll put the thing in to the order, then you'll get a letter at home in the mail okay.

PATIENT X566
Okay.  

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Alright.

PATIENT X566
So I can go do the blood tests now.

FIRST DOCTOR X566
Blood tests now and then an x-ray.

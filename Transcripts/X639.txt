PATIENT X639
Yeah.  I don't know what is the reason but that stopped it because on my right side it hurt bad, like when I turn over in the bed.  It was killing me and you know my wife, you know she talks a lot.  She says it's probably your blah, blah, blah and probably need to use the bathroom.  You know I took her advice so I came on back and talk about and you know that's what it was.

PATIENT X639
Okay.

DOCTOR X639
So you are due um.  It's a little early.

PATIENT X639
Oh.

DOCTOR X639
But uh it’s okay, we'll just put that you've been having all this pain and what not.

PATIENT X639
It's not way too early is it?

DOCTOR X639
No.  It's like a few months.

PATIENT X639
Okay.

DOCTOR X639
So it won't really make a difference.

PATIENT X639
Yeah.  Because you know when I had it done the first time, she said they found two something and they cut them off.

DOCTOR X639
Yep and that's why you have to have it done five years later so that one was about five years ago.  Um and then I saw so you went and got you hearing aids.

PATIENT X639
Yeah I got one hearing aid.

DOCTOR X639
How's that so uh they didn't find anything wrong.  Cause I remember the last time your hearing.

PATIENT X639
That's because some of my hearing is lost in the left ear.

DOCTOR X639
That is, well I'm glad that you have that for your left one.

PATIENT X639
@@@.

DOCTOR X639
Oh.  Well you can hear me, sound good.

PATIENT X639
Okay.

DOCTOR X639
Why don't you sit up here I'll take a listen to you.

PATIENT X639
Uh.

DOCTOR X639
Deep breath.  

PATIENT X639
I got what they did with my naval.  I had um.

DOCTOR X639
I'm going to have you lay back.

PATIENT X639
What's that operation?

DOCTOR X639
Hernia.

PATIENT X639
Umbilical.

DOCTOR X639
Yeah.

PATIENT X639
And sometime there be something running out of it.

DOCTOR X639
But does it go back in?

PATIENT X639
Yeah.

DOCTOR X639
That's okay.

PATIENT X639
Okay.  I got one more thing.

DOCTOR X639
Yep.

PATIENT X639
I got a cough.

DOCTOR X639
Okay.

PATIENT X639
At night I have a real bad cough.  It just started a couple days ago.

DOCTOR X639
Have you been using your inhalers?  Okay, does it help?  Probably your asthma with changing of the season.

PATIENT X639
Yeah that's what I was thinking.

DOCTOR X639
Usually nighttime cough, that's what it is.

PATIENT X639
Yeah it's bad.

DOCTOR X639
Yeah.  Um you're just taking the albuterol now right?

PATIENT X639
Um I don't know they gave me something.  I was taking.

DOCTOR X639
Formoterol are you using that too?

PATIENT X639
No they gave me just one.

DOCTOR X639
Formoterol with mometasone?

PATIENT X639
Nope.

DOCTOR X639
No steroids?

PATIENT X639
I was taking it but she gave me this one that replaced that.  Instead of taking both of them she said it's just one.

DOCTOR X639
Yeah that's one.  Uh I don't know the name of it.  It's the two things in one.  But it's a steroid, you been using that?

PATIENT X639
Yeah.

DOCTOR X639
How long has the cough been going on?

PATIENT X639
About three days.

DOCTOR X639
Okay.  And I think maybe we should just let it ride out for a little bit.  It's not like changing the medicines is gonna do much.  I'm pretty sure it's probably the asthma so I think you just have to give it a little bit of time.  If it gets worse you can maybe try changing the medicines.  I think with only three days we don't really want to do anything aggressive and then have you on too much medicine.

PATIENT X639
Okay.

DOCTOR X639
Does that sound okay?  Your lungs sound good.  You're not wheezing or anything like that so.  Um and you haven't had a prostate exam yet or anything like that have you?  Uh uh.

PATIENT X639
I thought the colonoscopy and the prostate is different?

DOCTOR X639
Yeah the colon, the prostate is a different uh.

PATIENT X639
I never have done it.

DOCTOR X639
We can do a blood test so let's do that.

PATIENT X639
Okay.

DOCTOR X639
Um and then.

PATIENT X639
I don't know I took a blood test.  Oh you already took it.

DOCTOR X639
Do what?  You had a blood test.

PATIENT X639
Yeah.

DOCTOR X639
Yeah it looked at um, it looked at you, we want to look at your lipids, your cholesterol.  You haven't had that for a while so um.  Alright well let me go talk with DOCTOR to see if he has any other thoughts about things to change and you're not taking anything for your cholesterol are you?

PATIENT X639
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR X639
Okay.  We might need to go up on one of these blood pressure pills cause it looks like the last time you were here it was a little high.

PATIENT X639
Yeah.

DOCTOR X639
So maybe we'll go up on your amlodipine um, so we'll go ask him okay.  I'll be right back.  Everything else looks great.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:11  DOCTOR IN:  37:18)

DOCTOR X639
Alright.  Everything he said looks good.  We'll get for you blood tests today.  We'll go up on the amlodipine and um.

PATIENT X639
Um could you put in um a what do you call it?  A consult for me to go to the gym or the Wellness Center?

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X131
You ready? 

PATIENT X131
Yes doc.

DOCTOR X131
So how have you been?

PATIENT X131
Pardon?

DOCTOR X131
How's the hip?

PATIENT X131
Oh fine.

DOCTOR X131
Good.

PATIENT X131
It's coming along very good.

DOCTOR X131
That's good to hear.  You still doing rehab with it?

PATIENT X131
Pardon?

DOCTOR X131
You still going to Rehab?

PATIENT X131
No.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
No but my @@@ coming along fine.

DOCTOR X131
It's good to see you again.  Uh how are you feeling since the last time I saw you?

PATIENT X131
Well.

DOCTOR X131
@@@.

PATIENT X131
As far as my hip goes I feel fine.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
And that part I think is going very good.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
I can walk up the steps very easy now and uh and it's actually coming very good.  But the prostate, I don't know if those pills are doing me any good.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Uh I can go a long time; at least I can sleep all night you know.

DOCTOR X131
So it helped in that regard but not really in any other?

PATIENT X131
Well I don't think it's doing that much.  It's doing some good.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
But not a lot.  Maybe it's not giving it enough time.

DOCTOR X131
Well, you've been on it for what, a little over a month now right?

PATIENT X131
Well about a month yeah.

DOCTOR X131
It should have some effect.

PATIENT X131
Uh-huh yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Um, Flomax works a little bit quicker.  We could also trying something called finasteride and unfortunately, when is your next follow-up with GU?

PATIENT X131
Pardon?

DOCTOR X131
Uh, I'm wondering when your next Urology follow-up is?

PATIENT X131
Oh, I don't know.

DOCTOR X131
Let me take a look uh.  So the main ingredients here are like the Flomax, which is what you have now.

PATIENT X131
That's what I have now.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah and then you're not on the finasteride right?  Proscar.

PATIENT X131
Pardon?

DOCTOR X131
Have you ever been on Proscar or finasteride?

PATIENT X131
Proscar?

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
Is that another pill?

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
Evidently not.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  Those are the two that I kind of use a lot.  After that it kind of comes down to surgical substance as well as the urologist.

PATIENT X131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X131
Um if they can do anything to open it up.  Your PSA is still really good.

PATIENT X131
Oh good what is it?

DOCTOR X131
Less than, I mean undetectable.

PATIENT X131
Oh, oh good, good.

DOCTOR X131
So.

PATIENT X131
Now when I use a catheter.

DOCTOR X131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X131
I don't have any trouble inserting those, you know what I mean?

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.  Is it bothering you to use the catheter?  Maybe just a little bit.

PATIENT X131
Well not now.

DOCTOR X131
I mean I know it's not the most ideal thing in the world but it.

PATIENT X131
No I, I deal with that I go along with it you know.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.  I think it's just going to come down to whether um, whether we're going to want to manage it using the catheter or whether it's going to be surgical and I think that Urology is probably going to lean toward @@@.

PATIENT X131
I don't think there's anything blocking it because the catheter, I don't have any trouble putting it in there and taking it out of there.  I mean there's not something that's stopping it, you know what I mean?

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
But uh.

DOCTOR X131
@@@.

PATIENT X131
But I can go 12 hours without using the catheter.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah but uh.

DOCTOR X131
So you just have a hard time just going on your own though?

PATIENT X131
Well I don't have a hard time going, I have a hard time going enough.

DOCTOR X131
Going enough.  So you're not.

PATIENT X131
I'm not, no.  I go maybe a weak stream for 10 seconds.

DOCTOR X131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X131
And then maybe five minutes later I go back again and maybe another one for 10 or 15 seconds.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  So you going a lot?  A small amount but a lot of the time?

PATIENT X131
Well uh, I can yes.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
But it doesn't empty my bladder you know.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  How long has that been going on again?

PATIENT X131
Well I think it's been going a long time because I noticed, I've had trouble before but I didn't realize what it was.  I did realize that it wasn't, my bladder wasn't being emptied.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
When I get up I go to the washroom and I go and by the time I walk to the front door and pick up the paper and come back then I'd go again.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
But not enough evidently.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.  So how many times do you use the catheter a day?

PATIENT X131
Well maybe three times.

DOCTOR X131
Okay and if you don't use the catheter how many times do you have use the bathroom a day?

PATIENT X131
Oh I don't know maybe five times.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Do you use a catheter every day?

PATIENT X131
Yes.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yes because I want to use it at night before I go to bed.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Because I want to sleep all night.

DOCTOR X131
Okay do you use it like, so during the day do you just use the washroom or do you use the catheter?

PATIENT X131
Well both.

DOCTOR X131
Both.

PATIENT X131
Yeah if I feel that I need to I'll use the catheter.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
But I can go 12 hours without using it.  Oh and I mentioned to you before I have to go to the skin doctor you know.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
How does that look now, my nose?  Look pretty good?

DOCTOR X131
It looks better.

PATIENT X131
Yes, you know I put salve on there, yeah I don't know what they call it.

DOCTOR X131
You still need to get a look at it.  You have an appointment uh next week.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
So but it's still probably something to look at.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.  So I don't know but I put that on right away today or not.

DOCTOR X131
Are you having any pain in the hip right now?

PATIENT X131
No.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  What medications are you taking right now at home?

PATIENT X131
Uh well I'm taking one medication for my heart.

DOCTOR X131
Do you have the list?

PATIENT X131
Let me see what did I do with this, it's not on there I don't think.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  Because you have been on hydrochlorothiazide in the past, do you know why that was?

PATIENT X131
Yeah well I took one tablet, a small yellow tablet.

DOCTOR X131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X131
Once a day before I cut in half but I take the full tablet.  Let's see what is it, I don't even know if they have it on there.  

DOCTOR X131
I’m trying to see who uh.

PATIENT X131
This one I'm taking for the, I don't know if it's a diuretic, what is it?

DOCTOR X131
Well you're not on a diuretic @@@.

PATIENT X131
No.

DOCTOR X131
That's why I wanted to look at it.

PATIENT X131
But I just take that one you know in the morning.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah the, so the Rehab doc stopped your hydrochlorothiazide.  I'm not really sure why.

PATIENT X131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X131
Let's see.  But I think you should be on one.  Your blood pressures have been a little high.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.  Yeah the last one, when they take it right away it is that high.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
But it's not 80 or 90, 180 or 190 or anything like that.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah but 150s, we still want to get you lower than 150.  You're doing pretty well.

PATIENT X131
Well I can get it down much lower if I sit down at home.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  Let me recheck it.  Do you have the list with you?

PATIENT X131
Yeah but, no I can get it down to 120s.

DOCTOR X131
So are you taking, you're taking the enalapril?

PATIENT X131
Is that a little yellow tab?

DOCTOR X131
I don't know what.

PATIENT X131
A little orange tablet?

DOCTOR X131
Yeah I'm not sure what they look like, let me see if I can look it up.  Is it a once a day pill.

PATIENT X131
No just once a day I take.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  

PATIENT X131
One tablet once a day in the morning.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  Let's see what we've got here.

PATIENT X131
The problem is now; if I get up in the morning and I take my blood pressure it's high.  It might be 160.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah we want to get you lower than that.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.  If I take it right away but if I sit there for 10 minutes, you know watching the news or reading.

DOCTOR X131
It'll come down?

PATIENT X131
It comes down, maybe 140 yeah.  I don't have any problem with that.

DOCTOR X131
@@@ low.  Let's see if we can find it on Google, what it looks like.  But you're on two blood pressure medications right now, so you should be taking both of them twice a day.

PATIENT X131
Both of them?

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
Oh, okay can you just mark that down there?

DOCTOR X131
Yeah, so yeah.  Mark your blood pressure medications?

PATIENT X131
Yeah because I probably have some.

DOCTOR X131
This is supposed to be half tab twice a day.

PATIENT X131
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X131
And this one is also the other blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah I'll try that then.

DOCTOR X131
And this one is a whole tab.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Twice a day.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X131
And I don't want to start you on another one.

PATIENT X131
Na, na.

DOCTOR X131
Well I know that's 2.5 but you have the 20.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, well uh.  I know before when I was taking the blood pressure medicines.  It got so damn low I was below 100, it was 90s, 80s, you know.

DOCTOR X131
Oh really.

PATIENT X131
Yeah remember I told you I got.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
I got sick that day.

DOCTOR X131
I do remember that, that's right.  That's why we stopped the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X131
Yeah so then I quit taking those.

DOCTOR X131
But you had lost some weight too right?

PATIENT X131
Well I did lose the weight, now I'm trying to get the weight back.  I'm up to about 180 now.

DOCTOR X131
Does that look familiar?

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
The enalapril okay.  That should be two pills twice a day.

PATIENT X131
Yeah okay then.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
And the uh metoprolol is the other blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT X131
Yeah okay.  Yeah I'll take those again.

DOCTOR X131
When was that that your blood pressure got really low?  I remember that now, I forgot about that.

PATIENT X131
What was that now?

DOCTOR X131
When was it that your blood pressure was low?

PATIENT X131
Oh, well I don't know, probably two months ago now or something like that.  But it really scared me.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah, I had forgot about that.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.  I mean I, going up the steps, probably about seven or eight steps at my son's place and of course I can't make it to the top.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
I know I'm going to fall you know.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
So then what I did.

DOCTOR X131
Well what may have happened was when you lose weight um.

PATIENT X131
Well I.

DOCTOR X131
Your blood pressure comes down with the weight loss.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, I'm not losing any more weight now.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
And I wasn't on the weight loss thing.  When I was losing the weight, which I tried to do to help my leg.

DOCTOR X131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X131
Then my stomach muscles shrunk.

DOCTOR X131
Oh.

PATIENT X131
I couldn't eat much.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
Now I'm back I can eat all I want to.

DOCTOR X131
Okay good.

PATIENT X131
You know what I mean.

DOCTOR X131
Can I get you to sit over here?

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
I want to take a look at your feet.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Um but I think going back on the hydrochlorothiazide would be a good thing for now.  You have a blood pressure cuff at home right?

PATIENT X131
Yes.  Yeah it's fairly accurate.

DOCTOR X131
So.  We'll start you on blood pressure medication.  I'll have you checking the blood pressure at home though because if it starts to drop again call in and we'll stop the, stop one of the medications okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, okay.   What'd you want my arm or what?

DOCTOR X131
Oh you can stay there.

PATIENT X131
I can stay here.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.  I just want to take a listen to you.  No this is good.  That doesn't do much good.

PATIENT X131
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR X131
Sometimes.

PATIENT X131
Well that's not much, not that.  It's not much help at all.  @@@.

DOCTOR X131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X131
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Can you open your mouth; stick your tongue out okay.  It looks better.

PATIENT X131
Oh good.

DOCTOR X131
But you should probably see your dermatologist @@@.

PATIENT X131
Well I'm putting those two things on there a couple times a day.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  Any pain here?

PATIENT X131
No, no I don't have any pain.

DOCTOR X131
@@@ for me.

PATIENT X131
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Take a couple of deep breaths.  You can breathe normal.

PATIENT X131
Everything seem okay?

DOCTOR X131
What's that?

PATIENT X131
Everything okay?

DOCTOR X131
Yep.  It was your left hip right that they did the surgery on?

PATIENT X131
No the right the right.

DOCTOR X131
The right, that's right.

PATIENT X131
Yeah right here.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.  Does it hurt when I press here?

PATIENT X131
No.  No.  It doesn't hurt at all.

DOCTOR X131
Okay good.  I'm glad that it's doing so well.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
And it is coming along very good.  I have a little gadget to put my sock on.  I can't reach my right foot to put my sock on.

DOCTOR X131
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X131
Oh ever since I had the surgery yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah it may come back in time as you get used to you know.

PATIENT X131
Well.

DOCTOR X131
It works out more.

PATIENT X131
Today I was able to put my sock on the right foot.

DOCTOR X131
Good.

PATIENT X131
Not easy but I made it.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
So it's coming along.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah I think as you work with the hip more it'll get more loose.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Um.

PATIENT X131
As I do more.

DOCTOR X131
Exactly.

PATIENT X131
But the problem I got, like I want @@@ that I want to do I can't do.  I can't get up you know and if I want to do a push-up I can't get up off the floor.

DOCTOR X131
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X131
Oh well since I've had the operation.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah I just can't do it.

DOCTOR X131
Um.

PATIENT X131
See I do a lot of things myself.  I wash the car; I change the oil in the car.

DOCTOR X131
Now the push-ups, you were able to do push-ups before?

PATIENT X131
Yes.

DOCTOR X131
The surgery.

PATIENT X131
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X131
So now do you just feel too weak or is there pain?

PATIENT X131
Well I can't get up off the floor.  If I get down on the floor then I can't get up.  I have to drag myself somewhere like to.

DOCTOR X131
How come you can't get up?  @@@.

PATIENT X131
My leg isn't strong enough.

DOCTOR X131
Oh okay.

PATIENT X131
My legs aren't strong enough to get me up.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah I think it might take a while.

PATIENT X131
Yes but they're coming along.

DOCTOR X131
Exactly.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Um.

PATIENT X131
Yeah they're coming along.

DOCTOR X131
You're 85 years old um.

PATIENT X131
Yeah so every day is a good day.

DOCTOR X131
Well I don't mean it that way but you know those kinds of things, you know muscle mass might take a little longer to come back than for a 20-year-old.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, yeah but my leg is getting stronger.  My arms are getting stronger.

DOCTOR X131
So don't get frustrated.  It'll keep back if you keep working with it.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
So I don't have too much trouble.

DOCTOR X131
Um.  I'll be right back with you okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Any other questions or problems today?

PATIENT X131
Not really.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131

DOCTOR X131
Arizona?

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
They make a crazy amount of money.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
I'll be right back with you okay.

PATIENT X131
Okay, back here right.

DOCTOR X131
Sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:27  DOCTOR IN:  41:48)

DOCTOR X131
Alright.  So you need to come back so I could say hi.

PATIENT X131
Yeah if I see him, if I don't get much better.

DOCTOR X131
I haven't seen that in a long time so.  It's because I'm here all the time, I don't see anyone anymore.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Um so a couple things, like I said I want to restart that one blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, well I'll do that yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah we want to get this number a little bit lower.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
But I want you to check your blood pressure at home um, at least for the next month or so to make sure that you're not falling too low.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
And if you notice you're getting dizzy or lightheaded.

PATIENT X131
No.

DOCTOR X131
Um if you do.

PATIENT X131
Well.

DOCTOR X131
Check your blood pressure.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
And call us okay.

DOCTOR X131
Um so now you're going to be on uh.

PATIENT X131
The two of those.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.

PATIENT X131
Well do I start this @@@.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah I'll just write down what you're going to be on now.  Okay so you'll have two for blood pressure and the other one is going to be.

PATIENT X131
I still have some of those at the house you know.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  I'll put in refills for everything today too.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
So this new one is just going to be once a day.

PATIENT X131
Pardon?

DOCTOR X131
This new one's going to be just once a day.  You were already on it before we stopped it because of your low blood pressure in the past.

PATIENT X131
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X131
So you'll be on the enalapril, metoprolol and the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT X131
Once a day.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah, this one is once a day, these two are twice a day.

PATIENT X131
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X131
This is for blood pressure.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
The other one I want to try you on today is uh something called finasteride.  You said you haven't ever been on that before.

PATIENT X131
No.

DOCTOR X131
Okay the other name is Proscar.

PATIENT X131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X131
Now this is another prostate medication.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
It can take a little while to work as well but I'd give it at least 2-4 weeks before.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
You see any difference.

PATIENT X131
Good.

DOCTOR X131
But um we'll try it today and see how you do.

PATIENT X131
Oh good.

DOCTOR X131
It may help your prostate a little bit.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Uh keep using the catheter if you need it.  If it's not bothering you, I mean @@@.

PATIENT X131
It doesn't bother me.  I have to use it because otherwise I'd be getting up every hour and a half.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah, you want to be sleeping.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
So these are the two that you're taking now for the prostate, the one we start, you're going to be on Flomax and the finasteride.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
And then um next time you're at the urologist doctor just let him know.

PATIENT X131
Yeah that'll be another week, the 18th.

DOCTOR X131
This is the 18th.

PATIENT X131
Not the urologist uh the skin doctor, the dermatologist.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah the urologist, I think they wanted to see you in.

PATIENT X131
Probably quite a while.

DOCTOR X131
In July.

PATIENT X131
Oh.

DOCTOR X131
Another two months or so.

PATIENT X131
Oh okay.  Right, yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah well that's great.

DOCTOR X131
And I think that's about it.  I'm glad to hear the hip is doing better.

PATIENT X131
Yes, everything is fine it's just.  I'm surprised myself.

DOCTOR X131
I'm not surprised but you're doing better than I thought.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Not that, I mean usually these hip surgeries people do better but it takes a couple of months before they feel better.

PATIENT X131
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR X131
The first time I saw you, you were doing much better than you know, when I saw you in November you couldn't get out of the wheelchair.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X131
I'm glad.  The other thing today is, it's something new the VA's doing, it's just um uh, do you have any Advanced Directives as far as you know?

PATIENT X131
A what?

DOCTOR X131
Advanced Directives um.

PATIENT X131
What is that?

DOCTOR X131
Uh, Living Will, Power of Attorney.

PATIENT X131
Oh yeah, my daughter is.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X131
I have everything all set.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
My daughter gets the house.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
And my son gets my money, which isn't much but it's something anyway.

DOCTOR X131
Do you mind telling us, now I want you to bring a copy of that uh, you know as far as who gets what the VA isn't really that concerned with who, we're more concerned with who is your Power of Attorney.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
Not that I'm thinking anything's going to happen to you but it's just good to have.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
If anything were to happen to you, who we need to ask what to be done, you know what medical procedures to be done.

PATIENT X131
Yeah.

DOCTOR X131
And if you have any wishes uh besides that, you know about medical treatment, all that kind of stuff.

PATIENT X131
No, no, well my daughter, she's @@@ next door.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
In the Intensive Care.

DOCTOR X131
Right NAME yeah.

PATIENT X131

DOCTOR X131
But just for legal purposes we like to have a copy on file just you know.

PATIENT X131
Well I, let's see.

DOCTOR X131
Is that your oldest daughter?

PATIENT X131
Yes.

DOCTOR X131
Okay, did your wife @@@.

PATIENT X131
The wife I had when they were born is alive, I'm not married.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  So by default it would actually go to NAME anyways, we would ask her questions.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, yeah.  I've got everything in my will, if I should die in my will I'll be cremated and all that stuff.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah I don't have any problem with that.

DOCTOR X131
Yeah.  Like I said for the VA purposes, it's more like your health care stuff.  What you want done in terms of like an emergency, stuff like that.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X131
So if you could bring a copy in next time and we can give it to the guys up front and we can put it in the computer so if ever is an emergency we know what you want done.

PATIENT X131
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.

PATIENT X131
Yeah because I had that probably done a year or so ago.

DOCTOR X131
Good, okay.  If you bring a copy you give it to the guys up front and they can put it in your file.

PATIENT X131
Yeah I'll have to look it up.

DOCTOR X131
Okay.  Good seeing you.

PATIENT X131

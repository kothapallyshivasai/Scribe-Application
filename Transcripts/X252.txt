PATIENT X252
Oh.  Good morning.
 
DOCTOR X252
How are you?

PATIENT X252
Alright.

DOCTOR X252
@@@.

PATIENT X252
Thank you.

DOCTOR X252
@@@.  So @@@.

PATIENT X252
@@@.

DOCTOR X252
Um let's see maybe you can set this chair over here.  Okay.  So I can't believe it's been such a long time.

PATIENT X252
I know.

DOCTOR X252
Since I've seen you.  I'm really glad they went through my @@@ list.

PATIENT X252
Oh my gosh really.

DOCTOR X252
Yes.

PATIENT X252
Time flies when you're having fun huh.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah so what's been going on?

PATIENT X252
Uh @@@ and I've been trying to get a knee replacement but I've had um cellulitis so many times.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
We were just going to do it on February 24th and on February 20th I got it again.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  Like right over the knee?  Is that where you're getting the?

PATIENT X252
No it was down the leg you know.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
You know here like.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
So it's been, with no wound, couldn't figure it out but.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
In the hospital for a week but, a few days, four days in.

DOCTOR X252
And where was that?

PATIENT X252
@@@.

DOCTOR X252
@@@ okay.

PATIENT X252
So a DOCTOR the orthopedic surgeon he's kind of backed off it now cause.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
It's been three times it's happened.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
So and I'm still confused.  There was one doctor said it comes from the MRSA.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
The cellulitis is a MRSA.  I never knew that uh, I just thought cellulitis was cellulitis and MRSA was MRSA.

DOCTOR X252
No I, MRSA is a common cause for cellulitis.

PATIENT X252
Oh really?

DOCTOR X252
If you're in the hospital well you can get the hospital-acquired kind and sometimes you hear on the news about like you know outbreaks at schools or something where a lot of students at school, seem to pass that are around each other.

PATIENT X252
So you can get cellulitis in other places besides your legs?

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
Oh.  

DOCTOR X252
Yeah you can get it anywhere and it's not always cellulitis.  Sometimes you get little abscesses.

PATIENT X252
Okay.

DOCTOR X252
Um but I think you in particular are kind of prone to getting.

PATIENT X252
Yeah.

DOCTOR X252
The cellulitis.  Now you're probably tolerant to it, meaning that you've got this bacteria that lives in your skin all the time.

PATIENT X252
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X252
Um just like you know because I work in the hospital I probably have it too but.

PATIENT X252
Yeah.

DOCTOR X252
If you have a little break in your skin, something that makes you susceptible it can take hold and it kind of flourishes there.

PATIENT X252
It's probably true because I was putting my wheelchair in the back of my Honda Pilot and taking it out, I was always hitting myself or cutting myself so the VA got me a lift.  So that did away with that anyway @@@ came back.

DOCTOR X252
It came back anyway.

PATIENT X252
But I was wondering maybe the VA would replace the knee.  That's why I went to Orthopedics, see what they said.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah.

PATIENT X252
Cause it is an injury from the service.

DOCTOR X252
Right.

PATIENT X252
So I don't know.

DOCTOR X252
Uh yeah I'd be interested to hear why, you know what exactly is preventing them @@@ I mean it's a bad idea once there is infection, that'd be a bad idea.  @@@.

PATIENT X252
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X252
You know no matter what hospital you go to.

PATIENT X252
Okay.

DOCTOR X252
Um so it may be a wise decision that they're making cause you know I mean the last thing we want, as you know, is if there is an infection anywhere.

PATIENT X252
MRSA.

DOCTOR X252
Cause you want, you know a new knee in there and then have it be infected.

PATIENT X252
Yeah I know cause I got a new knee here.

DOCTOR X252
Right.  But I know it's frustrating um.

PATIENT X252
Could I at least go see him though so I can tell those folks and we @@@ that they don't think it's a good idea either?

DOCTOR X252
Uh, yeah we'll see if we can get you in their clinic.  Alright um, anything else going on?  Have you been?

PATIENT X252
I been pretty good.

DOCTOR X252
Have you been?

PATIENT X252
Except you know the CO, there you go.

DOCTOR X252
COPD?

PATIENT X252
Yeah.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
I met DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
So he told me not to, well he didn't say not to, he just said why don't you just start coming and see me at the VA?

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
So I been seeing him now.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  And did they change around any of your medications?

PATIENT X252
No, he thought that was a pretty good idea.  I wish I could see him today cause I've been on tramadol.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
And I need some, I don't know if you can give it to me, some of that uh, what they call it, Nystatin.

DOCTOR X252
Oh are you getting some.

PATIENT X252
Oh gosh.

DOCTOR X252
Stuff on your tongue.

PATIENT X252
Oh they're terrible.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
It's burning like.

DOCTOR X252
So how much prednisone are you taking a day?

PATIENT X252
I've been taking.

DOCTOR X252
I'm sorry (doctor was paged).

PATIENT X252
Oh that's alright.  Uh it's generally 10.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
But he did give me permission, he said you know you're going to have to seldom use.  You know I explained to him about how the 10 can really make a difference.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
In your breathing.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
But I have taken 20 on some days.  I was up in Minnesota; I got sick so I was taking 20 for about a week.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  How recently was that?

PATIENT X252
Uh two weeks ago and then I tapered down to 10.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
Then I did 5's and now I'm back to 10.

DOCTOR X252
Did you do okay on the fives?

PATIENT X252
No, it's like teasing yourself.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah okay.  

PATIENT X252
That's another thing I wanted to ask you doctor.  I'm really a thumb dunker.  They have this commercial for, I think its Sally Field.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
She takes a pill once a month or once every three months for uh bone loss.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
Why won't they give that to @@@ who are on prednisone?

DOCTOR X252
Um.

PATIENT X252
She takes that because of that prednisone or is she taking it because of I'm wonder if.

DOCTOR X252
Well it's called, I mean woman are more, get.

PATIENT X252
Oh osteoporosis yeah.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah, although being on prednisone does put you at risk for osteoporosis and other bone problems so I don't see anywhere um that you've had a scan looking for osteoporosis.

PATIENT X252
No I haven't in years.

DOCTOR X252
No.

PATIENT X252
I had one about seven years ago.

DOCTOR X252
Did you?

PATIENT X252
Yeah and they said there was narrowing at the hips or something to do with.  It wasn't here though, it was @@@.

DOCTOR X252
It wasn't okay.  Cause what it's called is a DEXA scan is what we'd be looking at.

PATIENT X252
Yeah it's pretty simple isn't it, just a quick wand and.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah let's see.

PATIENT X252
I was kind of wondering if I could get something like that to see if.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah I think that's reasonable so maybe we can get you set up with that.  Okay.  You're full of good ideas today.  Um okay, so.

PATIENT X252
That must be some pills she takes, cause I thought she said every 90 days.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah there are a variety of different kinds.

PATIENT X252
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X252
So there are some that you take every week, there are some you take every month there are some you take once a year.

PATIENT X252
How does it work, it just boycotts the bone loss somehow?

DOCTOR X252
Right, it kind of freezes the bone and prevents it from uh; it prevents it from breaking itself down.

PATIENT X252
Okay.

DOCTOR X252
Which can happen you know when you're on certain medications or in women who are approaching menopause.  However, it's not good to be on it forever so it's something we kind of use when we need it.

PATIENT X252
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X252
That's why we do the tests, we do the scans, to make sure that someone has osteoporosis so like really true bone loss before um, before we prescribe it.

PATIENT X252
There could be a chance I might not have bone loss, but probably not huh, I don't know.

DOCTOR X252
Well you never know.  How long have you been on the prednisone for?

PATIENT X252
Well I been on it 20-30 years probably yeah.

DOCTOR X252
Alright.  So we'll put in the Nystatin, you like the liquid stuff that you swish around and swallow?

PATIENT X252
Yeah, yeah.  It really relieves that burning.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  And how often do you use it?  A couple times a day or twice a day.

PATIENT X252
Yes. Uh probably at least once a day but probably twice a day.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
Some of the instructions say you can swallow it.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
One doctor told me don't swallow it, it's not good for the kidneys.

DOCTOR X252
Oh.  Um I'll have to take a look.  You can swish and spit.

PATIENT X252
Okay.  Like in the saloon huh.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah exactly.  Alright do you want to pick it up at the window or have it mailed to you?

PATIENT X252
I'd rather pick it up if I could.  I've got just a teeny bit left.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  Alright, let's see what else.  

PATIENT X252
I'm also going to try to go upstairs and see if they can give me a shot in the elbow.

DOCTOR X252
Oh yeah it's been helping you right.

PATIENT X252
Oh boy they really help.

DOCTOR X252
Good.  Now are you, did you take a look at the medication list that we printed out for you?

PATIENT X252
Yes.

DOCTOR X252
Well are we missing anything.  There must be more than we've got on here right now.

PATIENT X252
Uh yeah I'm taking something for the prostate uh.  Oh God, let's see what I got.  Book a commercial on television, football is driving me nuts.  I keep going, I keep going, I keep going uh.  I wonder what's the name of that stuff? 

DOCTOR X252
Uh is it Flomax?

PATIENT X252
Yes.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252

DOCTOR X252

DOCTOR X252
Okay and are you taking the hydrochlorothiazide for your blood pressure?

PATIENT X252

DOCTOR X252
And how about, are you on a Fentanyl patch?

PATIENT X252
Yes.

DOCTOR X252
You are alright.

PATIENT X252
That's the reason why I'd like to get this knee thing done.

DOCTOR X252
Right.

PATIENT X252
But like you said once the doctor thinks it's a bad idea.

DOCTOR X252
Yeah.  Alright so you're taking the lisinopril for your blood pressure, what am I missing?  Are you taking a stool softener?

PATIENT X252
Yes.

DOCTOR X252

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
Oh I was taking uh Viagra but Blue Cross, they didn't drop it but they raised it to $50 a pill so.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
That kind of blew me out of the ballpark for that and someone gave me Cialis.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
Which is, I don't see what it does but I have some of that.  That in itself, Blue Cross will allow you 24 every 50 days.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
And it's 6 or 8 bucks a pill.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
So it's.  I guess it depends on the way you look at it.

PATIENT X252
Okay.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  And.

PATIENT X252
He did say I had an extra beat but he said it's a generic thing, there's nothing can be done about it, the cardiologist.  He said I was at an infectious disease doctor and he looked at my heart and he asked me, you better go to Cardiology cause I hear something there, I'm not sure what I'm hearing but.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.

PATIENT X252
Then he explained to me there's nothing we can do or give you for it, it's just.  I think he said there's 30-40 million people have it.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  Alright.  So I'm going to take your blood pressure again.  It was a little bit high when you first came in.

PATIENT X252

PATIENT X252

DOCTOR X252
Okay has it been an issue when you go to your other doctor?

And then you wanted to get it replaced.

PATIENT X252
I don't really want to but it's so, this pain thing is.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
If I could get rid of all that you know.

DOCTOR X252
You get a lot of swelling in your legs?

DOCTOR X252
And this one you have no joint in there right?

PATIENT X252

DOCTOR X252
They took it out okay.  Okay, alright.  Alright and are you having blood work done somewhere?

PATIENT X252
Uh yes, I just had some done oh well it's been a few months.

DOCTOR X252

DOCTOR X252
You did okay.

PATIENT X252
And they okayed so and they did swab the nose for the uh MRSA and it came back okay and.

DOCTOR X252
Okay.  Alright cause there are, you know if, if I were the only doctor taking care of you there are some blood tests that I would want to get just to check up on some routine stuff.

PATIENT X252
Well I'll go for that if you want it @@@.

DOCTOR X252
You what?  Okay, just so we've got it on record and um.

PATIENT X252
Okay.  I think that would be good.

DOCTOR X252
Alright have you eaten anything yet today?

PATIENT X252
No, nothing.  I had a cup of coffee though at 5 o'clock but.

DOCTOR X252
Alright.  Did you have like cream and sugar in it?

PATIENT X252

DOCTOR X252
Okay and are you still using the CPAP?

DOCTOR X252
Alright.  So I am going to send the blood work in so you can get it.  I'm gonna put in an order for the DEXA scan just to take a look at bones and look for osteoporosis.

PATIENT X252
Oh thank you.

DOCTOR X252
Um and so, I guess the last thing that we'll need is um, to get a copy of that stress test that you had.

PATIENT X252
Okay.

DOCTOR X252
Cause I can put in for the consult for the orthopedist, they'll contact you about setting up an appointment.

PATIENT X252
Okay.

DOCTOR X252
And you can ask them about a possible knee replacement.  Um they would want us to kind of reassure them that from a cardiac standpoint, from a lung standpoint.

PATIENT X252
Okay.

DOCTOR X252
That you would be okay potentially to even go to surgery so um, so as long as you haven't been told that for some reason your heart wouldn't be able to withstand surgery or your lungs wouldn't be able to.

PATIENT X252
Actually that's why they sent me was to see if I was a good candidate for surgery.

DOCTOR X252
Who sent you?

PATIENT X252
Um DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X252
Oh you mean for the stress test.

PATIENT X252
Yeah she's the cardiologist.

DOCTOR X252
Exactly so.

PATIENT X252
But I should have been doing it every year now uh, I'm not sure, every 18 months.

DOCTOR X252
Oh okay.

PATIENT X252
And thankfully got a new medicine.  They used to have one that I used to think I was gonna die.

DOCTOR X252
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X252
It was horrible.

PATIENT X252
Yeah easier, but the new one had this really wonderful.  I hardly even noticed it.  She said it does the same thing.  

DOCTOR X252
Okay, alright, so we'll start with that.

PATIENT X252

PATIENT X252

DOCTOR X201 
PATIENT?  How you doing today?

PATIENT X201
Okay.  

DOCTOR X201
Oh man its freezing.

PATIENT X201
It could get be worse.

DOCTOR X201
How much worse can it get?

PATIENT X201
That's true.

DOCTOR X201
No @@@.  So how have things been going with you sir?

PATIENT X201
Okay.  You know I got a question for you.

DOCTOR X201
You got a question @@@ what?

PATIENT X201
@@@.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  The doctor before you.

PATIENT X201
I first started taking some of these pills, after a while your system, blood is, whatever he said you don't need to take the lipid stuff so I wasn't taking it.

DOCTOR X201
Lisinopril?

PATIENT X201
Yeah I wasn't taking it and all of sudden through the mail I got like two bottles, that's what I get cause I'm supposed to take it.

DOCTOR X201
Um.

PATIENT X201
@@@ I said something's got to be wrong, I said no, so I said so I started taking it again and I said the docs told me, I said what do I do with the pills that I got?

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.

PATIENT X201
@@@.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  Let's see when you were last in.  You were on lisinopril; it was on your medication list way back in October of 09.

PATIENT X201
Yeah I believe that.

DOCTOR X201
You should be taking it.

PATIENT X201
Okay.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.

PATIENT X201
Will you do me a favor?

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.

PATIENT X201
I called in for what I need refills on and I didn't put the lisinopril.

DOCTOR X201
The lisinopril?

PATIENT X201
Yeah could you put.

DOCTOR X201
I renewed all of your medications as of yesterday.

PATIENT X201
Oh good.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah so you should be getting them all in the mail and uh how have things been going for you?

PATIENT X201
Alright.

DOCTOR X201
You look thinner.  Do you think you're losing water weight or what?

PATIENT X201
Oh that and I work out.

DOCTOR X201
You started working out?

PATIENT X201
Yeah.  The only thing I got now, I got a damn head cold.  I got like an on/off sore throat.  My ears blocked up and maybe if they open up, you know.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.  How long has that been going on for?

PATIENT X201
Oh about almost two weeks.  I'll pop a Hall's and it soothes the throat.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  Any fevers or anything like that?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.

PATIENT X201
You know whenever you @@@ and you're too lazy to go to the bedroom to get @@@ sticking out of the mail slot, and there's stuff on the floor @@@.  

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.  

PATIENT X201
Uh it pays to be an idiot.

DOCTOR X201
So let's go over all your problems step by step here.  The top issues anyway.  For your diabetes, um did you get labs done when you came in today, labs today or?

PATIENT X201
Yes.  Just had it.

DOCTOR X201
That was just your INR though, your Coumadin level right?

PATIENT X201
I guess yeah.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  Um, back in November of last year, your diabetes was under pretty good control.

PATIENT X201
Well I monitor myself you know three times a week uh.

DOCTOR X201
How have your numbers been?

PATIENT X201
Like uh 100-120.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  When do you take your medicine then?

PATIENT X201
Well it's supposed to be on a Monday before breakfast, I take it like 7 o'clock.

DOCTOR X201
And that's running like 100-120?

PATIENT X201
Yeah around there, about 120 and then on the Wednesday before lunch so that's usually like around 1 o'clock and that's low.  Sometimes it's even 105.

DOCTOR X201
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X201
And then on a Friday before supper, I've had it where it was down to 90.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  Have you ever had any episodes of really low blood sugars, where you're kind of feeling shaky or lightheaded?

PATIENT X201
One time.

DOCTOR X201
Just one time, when was that?

PATIENT X201
Oh gosh that was during the summer.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.

PATIENT X201
It was one of those days when it was hot and I was doing something, oh I was playing with the dogs in the backyard and got all sweated up and then came in the house, that's when I started feeling that.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  Alright.  When did you last see an eye doctor?

PATIENT X201
Uh last year.

DOCTOR X201
That was here?

PATIENT X201
No, my other glasses got broke and I had to go to my neighborhood, @@@ xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.

PATIENT X201
I went over there and I got a pair of glasses.

DOCTOR X201
Well we're going to have you see the eye doctors here.

PATIENT X201
Hey uh that's right I did the.

DOCTOR X201
The diabetes @@@?

PATIENT X201
Yeah that was three years?

DOCTOR X201
Wow, we need to get you in there.

PATIENT X201
About three years ago.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah, lets get you in there.  Um do take an aspirin?

PATIENT X201
Yeah in the evenings, a kiddie aspirin.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.

PATIENT X201
Children's aspirin, I call them kiddie.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.  So we need to have you see and this is just a test for diabetes of the eyes, not for glasses.

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
Or anything like that.  Alright so diabetes looks like pretty good. Um you know you're measuring blood sugars, you're just taking the one medication for that, the metformin.

PATIENT X201
Yeah half of it.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah half a tab so that looks pretty good.  Your cholesterol was pretty close to where we want it back in November.  Your bad cholesterol is 74; we want that around 70, certainly less than 100.  Um in regards to your a fib or atrial flutter, you're on the Coumadin for that.  You're following with the Coumadin Clinic right?

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
And you're also on two medications, metoprolol.  What is the dose of your metoprolol?  Do you know?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Cause there was different, when I was reviewing your meds yesterday, it was different, this one says 100 mg but that's just over, I renewed it for, so you're going to be taking 75 mg.  How many pills are you taking of the metoprolol?  Do you know?  Are you taking one or one and a half?

PATIENT X201
Uh, the metoprolol, is it a little @@@?

DOCTOR X201
No that's for your blood pressure and heart.

PATIENT X201
Uh one.

DOCTOR X201
One twice a day?

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  I see here there are two orders in the system.  One was for 75 mg twice a day and one was for 100 mg twice a day and there's no.

PATIENT X201
Well one I take twice a day and the other one is once a day.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.  Let's do the 100 mg, I think you've been taking the 100 mg that you've been taking.

PATIENT X201
That one I take once a day in the morning.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah.

PATIENT X201
I got that metoprolol tartrate.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah exactly.

PATIENT X201
And other metoprolol, that's like a green color, blue, that's the one I take twice a day.

DOCTOR X201
Sure.  Um, are you on any water pills?

PATIENT X201
Yeah the furosemide.

DOCTOR X201
Twice a day right?

PATIENT X201
Yes.

DOCTOR X201
And how's, have you been watching your weight?  Like uh daily or no?

PATIENT X201
You can't have everything.

DOCTOR X201
Have you been watching your salt intake?

PATIENT X201
I don't use any.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  What about like eating salty foods, fried foods?

PATIENT X201
No I don't.  I've never, even when I was a kid.  My family are Lithuanian and most of the stuff you eat is boiled.  You know boiled chicken neck.  My great uncle lived to be 96.  You could give him $100 to eat something fried and he wouldn't touch it.

DOCTOR X201
Good.

PATIENT X201
But I don't even have mashed potatoes or French fries, I like bread.

DOCTOR X201
Okay, that's good.  And uh are you still smoking?

PATIENT X201
Sure.

DOCTOR X201
How much are you smoking?

PATIENT X201
Uh I smoke a pipe, maybe four or five times a day.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.

PATIENT X201
It's not no.

DOCTOR X201
Any interest in quitting?

PATIENT X201
No.  I like it.

DOCTOR X201
You understand the health risks though right?

PATIENT X201
Sure do.

DOCTOR X201
Okay so heart disease, stroke, lung disease.  You know we got those pulmonary function tests that were done.  That was a while ago but you do have what looks like um emphysema or bronchitis.  So you are having some lung damage and um that's probably why you've been short of breath too when you exert yourself.  Yesterday I just reviewed things and I could give you an inhaler called Combivent that you could use.  You use it every day twice a day okay and it might, this will help with your breathing when you exert yourself. Uh two puffs in the morning and two puffs in the evening and that way if you're like feeling like you could run a marathon you're breathing so good, don't do it okay.

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
And it'll help your breathing out.  Uh and but the best thing that you're going to do for that is to quit smoking okay.  So.

PATIENT X201
So really cause I puff on the pipe it's almost like not smoking because I don't inhale it that much.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah and your lungs have already suffered quite a bit of damage.  Like your pulmonary function tests your lung reserve is pretty low right now.  So you're like, as people age, as they get older their lung volume goes down.

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
And that's just normal aging.  Someone that smokes, their lung volume is going to go down really quickly okay.  If you were to stop smoking, you can't reverse the damage that's already occurred but you can go back on this normal slope so that the damage will occur less rapidly um so you know I'm afraid that if you continue to smoke, with your severe lung function uh it's gonna, you're going to end up being on oxygen and things like that, you're only 65, you need some more years you know.  Alright.  Do you drink alcohol?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Did you ever?

PATIENT X201
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X201
Okay and one other test we need to do is that I would encourage you to do, we never got an ultrasound of your belly, looking for an aneurysm and any male over the age of 55 that's been smoking for five or more years, deserves a screening for this and that's the ballooning of the aorta in your belly.

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
Um let's get that done okay; it's just a probe with some jelly on it, probably 20 minutes.

PATIENT X201
Will I have a foxy looking gal do it?

DOCTOR X201
Hopefully.  Not if you really want to get it at the VA though.

PATIENT X201
I don't care.

DOCTOR X201
I haven't seen too many foxy gals walking around with.

PATIENT X201
They used to have.

DOCTOR X201
Really?

PATIENT X201
Maybe guys like me chased them out.

DOCTOR X201
Are you getting any chest pain or pressure at all?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Do you when you exert yourself?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Uh have you gotten a flu shot this year?

PATIENT X201
No.  I don't need it.

DOCTOR X201
Even with your lung function?  How many people do you think die from the flu every year?  Throw a number out.

PATIENT X201
Oh a couple thousand.

DOCTOR X201
25,000 and that's just not worldwide, that's in the United States.

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
That is a lot of people dying from the flu and uh and you have other medical conditions namely heart disease, diabetes and now lung disease so you're a high risk if you ever get the flu and it's still floating around.  We're actually seeing more flu cases now than we were a couple months ago.  You're the only person, really only person that that hasn't worked on.

PATIENT X201
(Laughter)  I don't care.

DOCTOR X201
I'm not kidding you.

PATIENT X201
I know.

DOCTOR X201
I've had the most pleasant patient @@@ today and I want you to have it.

PATIENT X201
Are you serious?

DOCTOR X201
I'm serious about it and it's safe.  What's the reservation about it?

PATIENT X201
I just don't want it.

DOCTOR X201
Okay, I mean are you concerned that you're going to get sick from it or?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
What about the pneumonia shot?

PATIENT X201
Na.

DOCTOR X201
So if the flu shot and the pneumonia shot protects you from the main bacteria that causes pneumonia @@@.

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  I don't want to push it anymore.  I'm going to write refused the flu and Pneumovax vaccine.  How's your shortness of breath?

PATIENT X201
Hmm.

DOCTOR X201
Been okay?

PATIENT X201
Yeah okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X201
Yeah and have you thought any more about the cardiac catheterization?  Have you talked to your doctor DOCTOR about it?

PATIENT X201
Yeah, no.

DOCTOR X201
And you understand the risks of not going through that?

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
Uh how's your swelling in your feet or your ankles?

PATIENT X201
None.

DOCTOR X201
You don't have any?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Still not a regular rhythm but it's low.  @@@.  Any uh, that's good.  We need to get some, I know you were just down in the Lab but @@@.  Would you mind getting one more blood test, @@@.  Um do you mind getting one more blood test today just check out your kidney function cause you're on a really high dose of the water pill.  I just want to make sure that your kidneys are still functioning normally and we're not causing any damage to them with the high dose of the water pill @@@ and we can also test your diabetes to make sure that's been controlled for the last three months.

PATIENT X201
You mean get that done now?

DOCTOR X201
Yeah I'll send you down as soon as we're done here.  Okay.  Did you used to smoke cigarettes too?

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
When did you quit the cigarettes?

PATIENT X201
Oh, well actually it was when they raised the price and that was about four years ago.

DOCTOR X201
Okay.  Alright have a seat up here, take off your clothes for me.  @@@.  

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
Any sores on your feet at all?

PATIENT X201
No.

DOCTOR X201
And you're checking feet daily?

PATIENT X201
Yeah.

DOCTOR X201
Okay good.  Take some deep breaths in and out.  Again.  Just breathe normally now.  Let me check the lungs okay.  Look that way, @@@.  Okay.  Alright I really think you're gonna notice a difference with the inhaler.

PATIENT X201
@@@.

DOCTOR X201
@@@  yeah they definitely do help.  Okay let me just go talk to my supervisor about this stuff and I'll be right back.

PATIENT X201
Alright.  Are you going to fill out those forms?

DOCTOR X201

DOCTOR X201

PATIENT X201

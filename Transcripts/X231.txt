DOCTOR X231
PATIENT?

PATIENT X231 
Yes.

DOCTOR X231
Hi.

PATIENT X231
Hi.

DOCTOR X231
How are you?

PATIENT X231
Fine how are you?

DOCTOR X231
I'm okay, @@@.  How you feeling?

PATIENT X231
Pretty good @@@.

DOCTOR X231
Any problems recently?

PATIENT X231
No um, no problems, no pain.

DOCTOR X231
Good.

PATIENT X231
The nasal spray has been working.

DOCTOR X231
Good.

PATIENT X231
Um I mean, well see if we have a concern about the hepatitis thing.  I don't know you know.

DOCTOR X231
Right.  Well last time you were here we ordered a bunch of labs.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
For you to get done and then they haven't been done yet so um it's all in there and it's something that I think we should try to do today if we can.  Um was there any reason why you weren't able to get your labs done the last time I saw you?

PATIENT X231
I don't know, you know I don't know what the procedure was or.

DOCTOR X231
Oh okay, alright.  Well have you eaten today?

PATIENT X231
I had a cup of coffee and two peanut butter crackers.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.  Alright so we won't be able to check your cholesterol today um, let me see here.  So all you have to do is go down to the Lab on the first floor, all the orders are in the computer so they'll be able to draw the labs and before you leave here we might be able to just draw them up here.  So the nasal spray is working.

PATIENT X231
Yes.

DOCTOR X231
And then are you still taking the loratadine pill?

PATIENT X231
Yes.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.  Good.  How you doing on the smoking?

PATIENT X231
I took one of the patches.

DOCTOR X231
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X231
Because well I didn't smoke you know and I just put the patch on for two days and I took the patch off and didn't put another one on because I was still smoking so.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.

PATIENT X231
You know I still have all the patches though.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.

PATIENT X231
Um, well I've got another concern.

DOCTOR X231
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X231
And it concerns my toes uh.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.

PATIENT X231
I don't know I guess it's just fungus under my toes, it's itching really bad the last few months and I mean, you know when I shower or whatever, I cut the toenails down to the lowest point but like the big toe, oh God its.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.  You want to take off your shoes and socks so I can just take a look?  I guess that would help you know.  Pick your feet up off the floor.  Is it painful @@@.

PATIENT X231
@@@ see.

DOCTOR X231
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X231
Its, I mean fungus under there or whatever and just.  It's like the small toes are the only one I could lose you know.

DOCTOR X231
Okay, so you're having trouble cutting them.

PATIENT X231
Yeah this is just.

DOCTOR X231
Well I can send you to our podiatrists, who are specialists in the foot.  They can cut toenails and give you some cream to try to get the fungus out of there but that's a hard thing to treat.

PATIENT X231
Yeah.

DOCTOR X231
So let me see if we have.  Actually probably try a pill.  Get rid of that @@@.  So um the only thing is with the smoking, would you like a referral to our Smoking Cessation Clinic?  They have other tricks up their sleeves besides just the patches.

PATIENT X231
Sure.

DOCTOR X231
Okay, let's do that cause that, I think might be your best bet.  Eating okay?

PATIENT X231
Yeah, I eat pretty regular and uh but it's, I don't know it seems like I can't put any weight on though, you know.  I don't know.  It's just, I eat pretty regular and I can't put any weight on though.

DOCTOR X231
Alright but you're still smoking.

PATIENT X231
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X231
(Doctor makes a phone call)  Alright so, I think what we should do is maybe try the pills to get rid of the fungus first.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
And then we'll consider sending you to a podiatrist okay.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
So it takes a while for this to actually work okay?

PATIENT X231
Yeah.

DOCTOR X231
You can also use over-the-counter Lamisil cream, it's called Lamisil.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
It's an anti-fungal.  I would use the cream actually.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
And what you want to do is when you're showering; make sure that afterwards you dry it very, very well.

PATIENT X231
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X231
And then um I would leave it open to the air so if you shower at night, that's probably the best so that when you go to bed you leave it open to the air and then you could put the cream on, maybe once or twice a day.  Um it is just hard cause then you have to you know sit there with cream on your feet as opposed to you know being able to wear.

PATIENT X231
Yeah.

DOCTOR X231
Shoes and socks so um.  As much as you can use it but then only use it, you know you want to wash it off after a few hours.  Well we'll get those labs today, take a look at all your hepatitis counts okay, see what the viral burden is, how much of the virus you have in your blood and then we'll consider sending you over to the Liver Clinic okay.

PATIENT X231
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X231
Big deep breaths in and out.  Your lungs sound good.  Okay.  And you got your flu shot the last time you were here right?

PATIENT X231
Yes.  You know, I could never relate high cholesterol or even high blood pressure with being small.

DOCTOR X231
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X231
You know but I have been known to have high cholesterol some years ago.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.

PATIENT X231
And.

DOCTOR X231
Well that's something I'd like to check on you so.

PATIENT X231
Yeah.

DOCTOR X231
Um technically we need to have you fasting for that lab so um, I don't know what would be easier for you, if you want to just wait and hold off on checking all your labs until you can come back in the next couple days and be fasting for a lab draw, is that feasible or would you rather?

PATIENT X231
Like don't eat anything for like.

DOCTOR X231
So yeah so like when you go to bed that night until when you get here.

PATIENT X231
Yeah.

DOCTOR X231
Yeah just only water, with whatever medicine you need to take.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
Um and then just come in first thing in the morning, get your lab done and you can go to the canteen or to the cafe downstairs to eat something for breakfast.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
Would that be feasible?  When do you think you'd be able to come back?

PATIENT X231
Maybe what like Friday or?

DOCTOR X231
Yeah, yeah anytime within the next couple weeks would probably be fine.

PATIENT X231
Friday, Monday or @@@.

DOCTOR X231
Alright so it's in the system all you need to do is go to the Lab on the first floor downstairs okay.

PATIENT X231
When I come to the hospital just go to the Lab?

DOCTOR X231
Yep.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
Yeah and they should just have them in the computer.

PATIENT X231
Um the intake clerk, well he gave me the, I don't know I guess these are.

DOCTOR X231
Yeah, I have that.  That's for you to keep so that you know the medicines you're on okay.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
And do you need refills?

PATIENT X231
No I think I still have simvastatin, yeah I'm good until.

DOCTOR X231
I'll just refill everything.  Alright give me just a couple minutes here, let me go run this by my boss, I'll be right back.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
That can go in that.

(DOCTOR OUT:  36:52  DOCTOR IN:  43:39)

DOCTOR X231
Alright so, here's what we're gonna do.  We will get you the labs um and I get the results back, I'll probably put in the um order for the Liver Clinic to have you follow up with them okay.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
About the hepatitis.  They can explain to you all the treatments that's out there, what's available and we'll kind of go from there okay.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
And then the, I'm going to order you actually some ointment to put on your toes okay.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
I don't want to give you the pill right now because of your liver issue.  Let me order that right now and this, I mean you may be using it for.

PATIENT X231
Quite a long time.

DOCTOR X231
Like years okay, to try to get rid of this.  

PATIENT X231
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X231
Cause the way the toes grow and everything.

PATIENT X231
Yeah.

DOCTOR X231
That fungus it takes a long time to treat.  So just be aware of that okay.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
So when you get out of the shower, this is an ointment or it's a solution, it's not an actual ointment so when you get out of the shower dry your feet really really well and then you put this around the nail bed and on the top of the nail okay.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
And do that every day.  I'm going to give you a whole year's worth of refills on it.  Okay.  So then you'll come back on Friday and get all the um labs drawn.

PATIENT X231
You now when I was here last; we were going to touch bases on maybe the possibility of me seeing a dentist.

DOCTOR X231
Uh-huh.  Yeah, let me just take a look.  Are you service-connected here?

PATIENT X231
Uh no.

DOCTOR X231
So they won't do the dental, unfortunately.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
If you want to, you can go down to the xxx xxx xxx and I think they could get service connection for you but otherwise it's impossible to get you know dental care if you're not service-connected unfortunately.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
Um.

PATIENT X231
I could possibly speak with the.

DOCTOR X231
Yeah with the xxx xxx xxx I think it's almost over by the Building 228 um.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
So when you go down to the first floor you could ask them where to go where the xxx xxx xxx is and they can help.  Oh and the last time we talked about getting a colonoscopy, do you remember that?

PATIENT X231
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X231
Um, so we need you to get labs for that as well, that's kind of why they didn't do it before.  So let me put in for that refill again and then you'll need to get the labs drawn again okay.  So Friday you'll come back and get your labs done okay.

PATIENT X231
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X231
And then um I'll see you again in three months okay.  In the meantime, you'll probably get a phone call from the GI doctors and the liver doctors okay.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
About scheduling a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X231
Okay.

DOCTOR X231
And then your other meds will be mailed to you.

PATIENT X231
Alright.

DOCTOR X231
Okay.

PATIENT X231
Thanks.  Have a good day.

DOCTOR X231
Nice to see you okay, alright take care.

PATIENT X231
Thanks.

DOCTOR X361
Patient?

PATIENT X361
Yep.

DOCTOR X361
How you doing?

PATIENT X361
I'm surviving.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.  And you had a hernia repair?

PATIENT X361
A while ago.

DOCTOR X361
In March?

PATIENT X361
Was that this year?

DOCTOR X361
Did they do a maxillary cyst or anything right here?

PATIENT X361
Well that's why I visited the oral surgeon who doesn't have surgery privileges.  

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
Did all that under local, which was completely miserable.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
He pulled the tooth.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
And then went up into the sides that way and tried getting rid of everything.

DOCTOR X361
Did it work?

PATIENT X361
No.

DOCTOR X361
@@@.

PATIENT X361
Job one.

DOCTOR X361
Did you have it here?

PATIENT X361
It was done here.  He didn't send anything to Pathology so there's no Pathology Report.  He did it all under local and then the headaches came back.  They did a CT upstairs in Dental and said it's already come back; they needed to do it again.  I'm not doing that under local again.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
No initially they'd written a referral to xxx cause we didn't have an oral surgeon here.  Now we have an oral surgeon but he has no surgery privileges.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
So somebody's got to do something cause I cannot do that under local again.  There's just no way in the world.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
So I don't know.  I've had you know when I initially got admitted to the hospital here.

DOCTOR X361
Were evaluated by him again?

PATIENT X361
I told them I wouldn't go back to him.

DOCTOR X361
Okay what you should do is actually not to have surgery by him but go back to him and say I will not do it under local anesthesia cause I think he is the one that's gonna have to refer you to xxx.  Cause no matter what I do they're gonna be like well we have services offered at the VA so it's something that he will have to do.

PATIENT X361
Right but, I talked to him after he had removed it because he could feel it in the CT and he's like well because they got a CT, their own CT machine up there in Dental.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
He says I don't have surgery privileges.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
That's not my problem.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
You know but if I need something fixed and you can't fix it, he says well I can but under local.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
So he's saying he's willing to fix it.  I'm saying it's not gonna happen.
DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
Because to go into my and there a little tube about yeah long that you know and this is a two hour procedure.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
My hernia repair didn't take that long.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
So for him to take it cause there's actually a patch.

DOCTOR X361
So you were awake?

PATIENT X361
There is a, for the whole thing.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X361
There's a, they had.

DOCTOR X361
They didn't put you somewhat under?

PATIENT X361
No, he doesn't have privileges.

DOCTOR X361
@@@ to be a little bit under.

PATIENT X361
He doesn't have privileges.

DOCTOR X361
Is he new here?

PATIENT X361
Yep.

DOCTOR X361
Do you know if he has privileges now?

PATIENT X361
I don't know.

DOCTOR X361
@@@.

PATIENT X361
I don't know but, but I come in, you know he had to pull the one tooth.  The tooth had a root canal but there was so much pressure that's why I spent the week in the hospital.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
So that's when they did the referral to xxx cause they didn't have a surgeon, then he came in after I already had been screened at xxx but I went and checked when it could be done and they canceled it cause I came in with the papers, they canceled it because now we have an oral surgeon who doesn't have privileges.  So the headaches are back.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
So that actually has four things.  The headaches are back which I had a prescription for Imitrex, I got a couple of those left.  Imitrex is taking care of the problem.  Was taking care of the pain but it's never been a problem.  

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
Uh in the follow-up CT that they did up in the Oral Surgery said its back.  Okay he, after you take something out of the body, common sense says you send it to Pathology and find out what the heck it is.  He never did that.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.  Yeah.

PATIENT X361
You know that's doctor 101, you remove something you send it to Pathology.  So he never sent it to Pathology.  So we don't know what this even was.  But the follow-up CAT scan shows it's already returned.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
So something is in there that shouldn't be yet we don't know what it is because he didn't do what he should of done.  Now if push comes to shove I'll use my health insurance to go outside and get it done and pay for civilians.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.  I understand okay.

PATIENT X361
But I shouldn't have to go see a civilian doctor because I have VA health care.

DOCTOR X361
Was it the left side that they did?

PATIENT X361
Uh-huh, yep.  You know but I shouldn't have to see a civilian doctor because this guy doesn't have operating room privileges.

DOCTOR X361
Hmm.  Okay so that's one issue we need to address, so you haven't found another oral surgeon, that's one issue.

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
The headaches.

PATIENT X361
But the Imitrex does work for it.

DOCTOR X361
It works but we need to solve the problem.

PATIENT X361
Right I mean it's, we can't just so I'm gonna need a refill for the Imitrex.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
Just for that.  If we can get rid of the sinus problem or whatever is growing in there which we still don't know what.

DOCTOR X361
Are you still on the Imitrex @@@.

PATIENT X361
I got one a while ago.  I don't even remember how long it was.  I keep all my prescriptions.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah you need, looks like you need a refill.

PATIENT X361
Who wrote one?

DOCTOR X361
Probably @@@.

PATIENT X361
@@@.

DOCTOR X361
What um dose was it?

PATIENT X361
50.

DOCTOR X361
50 and how often were you taking it?

PATIENT X361
Oh, you know get nine in the box?  That could actually last me an entire year.

DOCTOR X361
Oh really okay.

PATIENT X361
But I've gone through two in the last three weeks.

DOCTOR X361
I'll write the, I'll give you a 30 day supply with like two refills okay.  So you should get 30 tablets.

PATIENT X361
Okay it comes in a specialty pill pack, there's nine pills in a package.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
It's almost like the uh, like the Steri-packs.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
The same as that.  It's nine pill packs so that's how it's dispensed.  I might have got, maybe I got it through the ER I don't remember but it comes in a nine pill pack.

DOCTOR X361
Alright okay.  So we'll do I'll write if for a 90 day supply then okay and then we'll get you a refill alright.  Anything else?

PATIENT X361
That works.

DOCTOR X361
Do you want it mailed or do you want to pick it up?

PATIENT X361
No I can pick it up, it's no big deal and now I see the knee guy today after you.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.  Who Rheumatology?

PATIENT X361
I saw the, I saw them.

DOCTOR X361
The rheumatologist?  Did they give you a steroid?

PATIENT X361
I saw them, they did a steroid.  He said before they can do the Synvisc injections, they gotta do the full steroid shots.  I'm like okay that's fine.

DOCTOR X361
But you don't see them until the 22nd.

PATIENT X361
But I saw the rheumatologist.

DOCTOR X361
It doesn't say you have anything here.

PATIENT X361
Then I'll go to Prosthesis.

DOCTOR X361
@@@.  Oh okay.

PATIENT X361
From here cause they've got the order to fill the brace.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
Cause they build that from scratch.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
Both legs.

DOCTOR X361
Okay. 

PATIENT X361
Does that say @@@?

DOCTOR X361
Um it's either sixth floor here or sixth floor in 228.

PATIENT X361
That's at 228.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
Alright so I gotta go see them um.

DOCTOR X361
And you got a steroid injection in your knee?

PATIENT X361
They did one in the knee.  He said before they can do the Synvisc injections cause @@@.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
They can't give the Synvisc until they do all the steroid injections.  

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
I'm like that's fine.

DOCTOR X361
Did it help at all?

PATIENT X361
Not even a little bit.

DOCTOR X361
Really.

PATIENT X361
Nope.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
But I knew that ahead of time.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X361
Now also rheumatoid doctor.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
Sent me to the podiatrist.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
Who gave me this.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
And ordered physical therapy, a block from the house so it's Mondays and Wednesdays.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.  Did that help?

PATIENT X361
VA covered eight visits.  Apparently the right leg is a whole lot weaker than the left leg but I already knew that.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
But they're working on that, trying to fix that up so that's going on.  They ordered eight visits so I don't know what happens after eight if they re-evaluate, if I go back and see the podiatrist or.

DOCTOR X361
They'll probably give you home exercises to do on your own at home.  That's probably what they're gonna do.

PATIENT X361
So there's that, okay so we got that and now the fun begins cause I have to keep track of what's what.  My 9-year-old has got a @@@ now okay.  She is 88 pounds.  So if I go somewhere you know I've got to lift her up plus the chair.  On Father's Day she was in the living room and I've got this big long chair and I went to pick her up from there out of the chair, to put her into the wheelchair and she tensed up.  I did something to the back of my arm right here to where I can't bend it.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
So I don't know if I tore a muscle, if I, I have no idea but I'm literally stuck with about two or three pounds working with this arm and other than that it's useless.

DOCTOR X361
With everything else.

PATIENT X361
So I know.

DOCTOR X361
Is it painful or is it weakness?

PATIENT X361
That's uh no it's extremely weak.

DOCTOR X361
But is it painful?

PATIENT X361
If I try and lift something, if I try to lift something it hurts right in here.

DOCTOR X361
Right there.

PATIENT X361
But I could push on it, it's not a big deal but if I try and actually lift something I just can't, so I don't know if I tore a muscle, if I chipped bone when she tensed up on me, I have no idea.  

DOCTOR X361
When you go to Physical Therapy show this to them.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.  We'll do some x-rays today.

PATIENT X361
And they just drew my labs.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.  So @@@ were okay.

PATIENT X361
Now that sounds right, yeah let's go do that.

DOCTOR X361
@@@ okay.  How about this, now pull me towards you okay.  Push okay.  

PATIENT X361
Yeah.

DOCTOR X361
Does the shoulder hurt?

PATIENT X361
No it's just right, it's just there so I don't know if I tore a muscle when I lifted her.

DOCTOR X361
Um go like this, now push, let it down right.

PATIENT X361
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X361
That feels good.  But so it really just your forearm though not your @@@.

PATIENT X361
Yeah but like the pain is literally just right in the joint itself.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
So I don't know if I just tore a muscle in there or what I did but I went to pick her up and I tried cradling her and as soon as I had her up she just tensed out and it just you know the arm just went straight so I, but after and on Father's Day there's you know but the muscle this or that went after a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR X361
So did you hit something?

PATIENT X361
No, no I went to lift her up and I was cradling here cause she's just rigid.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
And as I lifted her up she tensed out, she actually forced the arm straight.

DOCTOR X361
Oh.

PATIENT X361
From bent.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
I kind of think I tore a muscle or something.  Okay elbow, knee brain, pain med I take.

DOCTOR X361
Sure.

PATIENT X361
I wrote it down, I got it all.

DOCTOR X361
Good.  No trauma to the area other than what you said but you never hit it though?

PATIENT X361
No I didn't hit anything but like I said cause I had it cause I actually got down on my knees.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
Well on the one knee and I go underneath her and cradle her and then I you know lift her up from there and since I had her off the couch that's when she just went rigid cause she was having a seizure and you know since she did that the arm just went straight so I don't know if it's just a torn muscle or what I did.  But it's just I mean complete weakness lifting.  You know I'll have to reach for the coffee can, then I drop the coffee can and I have to have my coffee.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.  Of all your labs only one has come back and that one is all normal, your blood count's up.

PATIENT X361
Well that's a good thing.

DOCTOR X361
So we're just waiting on um your lipids, your cholesterol and then all of your electrolytes and the screening for diabetes and your cholesterol that we're still waiting on.

PATIENT X361
Yeah well I know my last A1c was a 5.3 which was nice.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah so it should be probably around the same um okay.  What are you using for pain control for your knee?

PATIENT X361
The uh.

DOCTOR X361
Tramadol?

PATIENT X361
Vicodin.

DOCTOR X361
Vicodin.

PATIENT X361
But I'm down to two pills.  After Physical Therapy cause I go there Mondays and Wednesday it's for a full hour and then at the end of the therapy then they ice it down.  By the time I get home it's rather uncomfortable.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
To say the least.  I walk in there with a little limp.  I walk out with a very pronounced limp.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
What's 228?

DOCTOR X361
That's the @@@.

PATIENT X361
Can I get it from inside or I have to go outside to get that do I?

DOCTOR X361
You can that from inside um.

PATIENT X361
So they give @@@?

DOCTOR X361
It's not the ER Service two other @@@.  Uh did you come into the ER today?

PATIENT X361
Uh.

DOCTOR X361
Okay so I would get your @@@.  So let's go with this is the ER and this is the parking lot.

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
And you park near the ED.

PATIENT X361
Cause that's the Spinal Center right there.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah so hmm yeah.  So I know here's the hallway.

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
And then this is the elevator that you get on right?

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
When you come up so instead of turning here you keep on in this hallway so when you get out the elevator make a right and then there's a big junction here @@@.

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
Then you want to make a left and then you'll see um towards the end of the hall you'll see um wood floors okay, you want to follow the wood floors.  If you go this way it's the Canteen, you don't want to go towards the Canteen.

PATIENT X361
Okay I understand.

DOCTOR X361
You go towards the Pharmacy, Outpatient Pharmacy.

PATIENT X361
Yep.

DOCTOR X361
You want to go this way and then follow the corridor out and the exit is over here.

PATIENT X361
Okay that works.

DOCTOR X361
So in relation to the whole hospital, this whole area is parking lot and here's xxx.

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
Okay so it's just right here to the exit to @@@.

PATIENT X361
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR X361
And um we have @@@.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
Okay so the big thing today is you have to, so I'm happy that your @@@ and your elbow right?

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
Okay everything is being worked on and stuff is happening already.

PATIENT X361
Yep.

DOCTOR X361
So we'll leave those aside and work on those two today.  Um.

PATIENT X361
If it's @@@ what about just a referral back to ENT and let them deal with it?

DOCTOR X361

We can, you can do that cause ENT is probably going to be able to do surgery.  They can already do surgery.  You don't have to go to the dentist.

PATIENT X361
Right.  Cause I mean he removed the tooth.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
Which it had a root canal cause that's what the whatever it was was pushing down on it.

DOCTOR X361
Why didn't ENT ever do it in the first place?

PATIENT X361
Because they said it required an oral surgeon to remove the tooth before they do anything.

DOCTOR X361
So the tooth was already out.

PATIENT X361
And now the tooth is out.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
Cause he had @@@ I had.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
That's what he took out so.  But if it's out now maybe they'll do their thing but.

DOCTOR X361
ENT is really good here.

PATIENT X361
You know it irritates me the fact that.

DOCTOR X361
@@@ ENT at xxx is the same as xxx.

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
And then it's one of the best programs.

PATIENT X361
But yeah it just irritates me the fact that he removed whatever this was and never sent anything to Pathology so we still have no clue what it is.

DOCTOR X361
Yes that's unfortunate.  Alright I'll be back okay and hopefully some of your labs will be back by then.

PATIENT X361
Okay can we refill all the meds?

DOCTOR X361
Yes.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
Do you want to pick them up today?

PATIENT X361
Sure why not?  Cause I got to go to 228 so I'm gonna be walking not that far from the Pharmacy anyway so I'll go there, I'll go to the Pharmacy to try and then I'll go to 228 get the knee brace then go back to the Pharmacy cause it'll take them a half hour to get it anyway.

DOCTOR X361
You need um do you use Naproxen at all?  The Naprosyn, Naproxen that's like ibuprofen.

PATIENT X361
Yeah I do.

DOCTOR X361
You do use it?

PATIENT X361
Yep.

DOCTOR X361
Do you use the omeprazole?

PATIENT X361
I haven't had a problem with the ulcer in over a year.  

DOCTOR X361
This prevents you from getting the ulcer.

PATIENT X361
Yeah I know it's worse but.

DOCTOR X361
Um do you use Tramadol?

PATIENT X361
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X361
You do use tramadol.

PATIENT X361
I use that, I try and use that instead of the Vicodin but I don't take them both together.

DOCTOR X361
Do you use the Ambien?

PATIENT X361
Yes.  Yes cause if I can take, cause what I'll do is just if the knee gets really bad I'll take a Vicodin and if it's not that bad I'll take an Ambien and the tramadol or the Ambien and the Naprosyn.

DOCTOR X361
What about bowel regimen, the Docusate are you taking it?

PATIENT X361
No I get that over-the-counter.  No problem getting a prescription for that and that's over-the-counter.

DOCTOR X361
And okay.  

PATIENT X361
There's no inhaler on there is there?

DOCTOR X361
Uh uh.

PATIENT X361
That's such a good thing.

DOCTOR X361
Why?

PATIENT X361
Cause I haven't used it in who knows how long.  It's amazing how much better it is to breathe when you quit smoking.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT X361
It's probably; it's got to be a year and a half since I've used one.

DOCTOR X361
Great.

PATIENT X361
You'd think me being a nurse I'd know better.  Well the order, cause I got a call last week.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
That said hey you got, you know you got your check with clinic next week so we'll put you in for 7:30 for labs.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
Just go down for the labs and @@@.  I go downstairs and like we've got nothing for you, they showed an order for labs but it didn't say any specific labs.  So I go upstairs, check in with them, they don't open till 8, but check upstairs then they'll put the order in the computer then you can come back here and get it redrawn.  So I come up, I'll say quarter to 8.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
Cause I was supposed to be here at quarter to 8 and I sit until 8:30 before anybody even calls me cause I check in at the desk and its 8:30 or so, the nurse called me back to do my vitals and she was just like we'll just draw your labs now so they actually drew it up here.

DOCTOR X361
That's fine, that's okay.  I don't expect them to be back @@@ do the blood so I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
Can you um go like this?

PATIENT X361
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X361
Is that any problem for you?

PATIENT X361
It hurts.

DOCTOR X361
It does hurt.

PATIENT X361
It hurts, it hurts.  It just sort of sits back here in the joints.

DOCTOR X361
Right here.

PATIENT X361
Really in the joint yeah.

DOCTOR X361
Does it help if I.

PATIENT X361
Nope.

DOCTOR X361
@@@.

PATIENT X361
No this happened on Father's Day so June 18th that's what it is.

DOCTOR X361
Do you feel like your arm has gotten more atrophied?

PATIENT X361
No it's just, I can actually use it but I just can't you know if I try and lift her up, you know if I carry her up the stairs cause there's six stairs to her bedroom, you know I got to you know lift up like this.  I can feel it hurts in the joint but now I got a sore shoulder going up the stairs.

DOCTOR X361
Okay I'll be right back.

DOCTOR OUT:  80:50   DOCTOR IN: 95:59 

DOCTOR X361
Alright so instead of an x-ray we'll do MRI.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
X-rays might show a fracture but the MRI will show any ligament tear and I think that's what really happened if you're having weakness um so we'll do that.

PATIENT X361
That's fine.

DOCTOR X361
And you have @@@ like every three months.  I mean @@@.

PATIENT X361
Hey now I've got the same thing on my work.

DOCTOR X361
@@@ goals.

PATIENT X361
I'm telling you, I'll tell you a secret now at my desk I've got so many programs that I actually have two monitors they're linked together and I'll have 10 programs at one time.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
I have one program to get into the computer.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
I have one program to check my employees for VISTA stuff.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
I have one third program for payroll, I made them all the same password so when you have to change your password put a number one at the end of it and then that day put a number two at the end of it and then that date put a number three at the end of it and just keep adding a number.

DOCTOR X361
Oh.  So my attending would like instead of adding a number just substitute the number but yeah same thing.

PATIENT X361
Yeah I don't so this one is the one, then it's now a two, then a three then a four.  I need to keep the same word, now I just keep the same word I just keep changing the numbers.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
And once you get to ten you can recycle.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah I'm not @@@.

PATIENT X361
That's not @@@ that's just I'm that lazy so if all I've got to do is add one number I'm good to go.

DOCTOR X361
Do you have any foreign metal in your body?

PATIENT X361
No.

DOCTOR X361
Previous surgeries?

PATIENT X361
Nope it's all gone.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.

PATIENT X361
There's nothing in there right now.

DOCTOR X361
Alright and we're gonna get you an Ortho consult cause Ortho may have to do something for the elbow.

PATIENT X361
Oh for the elbow.

DOCTOR X361
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X361
You know if I didn't have to pick her up so many different times a day the elbow would have had an adequate time to heal but being a single dad with a quadriplegic at home so it's not an option.  

DOCTOR X361
I'm gonna say I want to see you in a month or so @@@ in a month.  If I say within a week then they're gonna @@@.

PATIENT X361
Right yeah we want to do that.  Cause this happened Father's Day.  I thought it would've healed by now.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
About six weeks hmm when it happened.  

DOCTOR X361
And you've seen ENT in the past right?

PATIENT X361
They sent me to Oral Surgery because we didn't have an oral surgeon at the time.

DOCTOR X361
Because you have seen ENT you just have to make an appointment with them.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
And then they can do that out there so make sure you make that with them before you leave today.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
Okay.  And I think that's all we need to do.

PATIENT X361
Yeah she's the one that said you need to see Oral Surgery.

DOCTOR X361
For the tooth.

PATIENT X361
For.

DOCTOR X361
The tooth.

PATIENT X361
Which was an issue and then they're the ones that helped push it through because they didn't have an oral surgeon in house at the time.

DOCTOR X361
Okay and now all of your medicines are refilled um so you, this one so let's back up, no diabetes.  So for somebody without diabetes your LDL as long as it's under 130 its okay.  Yours is at 101.

PATIENT X361
Yeah getting under.

DOCTOR X361
If for some reason you got diabetes or any other hypertriglyceridemia then we want that to be closer to 70.

PATIENT X361
So 181, HDL of 49.

DOCTOR X361
So this is your total cholesterol number that everyone talks about and then this is the bad cholesterol that you always want to keep an eye on okay.

PATIENT X361
And the VA is 70-130?

DOCTOR X361
So nationwide if you don't have any medical problems at all 130 is the goal or less.

PATIENT X361
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR X361
If you have hypertension, high cholesterol, anything like that.

PATIENT X361
Right.

DOCTOR X361
Then 100 is fine.  If you've got diabetes our goal is 70.  Excluding diabetes, diabetes is like the life expectancy of a patient with diabetes or just HIV in today's world, people with HIV have a normal life expectancy.

PATIENT X361
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X361
People with diabetes don't.

PATIENT X361
Yeah.

DOCTOR X361
So diabetes is like one of those things that everyone has but they don't realize how bad it is.

PATIENT X361
Well I know guidelines for the insurance industry it's totally separate.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.

PATIENT X361
Cause total of under 200 HDL is about 40, LDL is low of 100 and triglycerides below a 50.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah.  So for your insurance @@@.

PATIENT X361
Yep.

DOCTOR X361
So.  Your LDL is 101.

PATIENT X361
I can deal with that.

DOCTOR X361
So yeah.

PATIENT X361
And you have to stay 130 for LDL huh?

DOCTOR X361
Um for no medical problems at all.  For you, other than your musculoskeletal issues.

PATIENT X361
Okay.

DOCTOR X361
You don't really have anything else and you're not taking any medications for high blood pressure or anything.

PATIENT X361
No, no.

DOCTOR X361
You're fine.

PATIENT X361
I love it.

DOCTOR X361
You're doing fine.

PATIENT X361
I love it.

DOCTOR X361
Keep it that way.

PATIENT X361
I love it.

DOCTOR X361
Cause if your diet stays the same now rather than 10 years from now your body's going to react to your diet very differently 10 years from now.

PATIENT X361
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X361
So your body will not produce these numbers.

PATIENT X361
I'll take it while I can get it though.  I'll @@@.

DOCTOR X361
So.

PATIENT X361
Cause the last time it was 201 so it's gone down.

DOCTOR X361
Um you're not due for a flu shot now.

PATIENT X361
Nope.

DOCTOR X361
Um okay you got the pneumonia.

PATIENT X361
So my cholesterol numbers went down, I like it.

DOCTOR X361
Yeah and.

PATIENT X361
The cholesterol went down, A1c is good, I haven't smoked in 3 1/2 years, yeah I'm not doing too bad.

DOCTOR X361
Okay, so take this and you can come back in another six months or a year.

PATIENT X361
Do it in six, I like to see you.

DOCTOR X361
Alright sounds good.  So make sure they make, they'll call you at this phone number, make sure you make the appointment for the next month out there.

PATIENT X361

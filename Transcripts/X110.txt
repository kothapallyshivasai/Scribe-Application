PATIENT X110
Not that I know of, although one of my tests was borderline they said.

DOCTOR X110
The glucose or your sugar?  Your sugar was borderline huh?

PATIENT X110
I think so.

DOCTOR X110
Yeah I don't know if you were fasting during these but you've had some that were slightly high.

PATIENT X110
Blood sugar.

DOCTOR X110
Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see, check another test on you.  Have you ever had this problem with the tingling before?

PATIENT X110
No.

DOCTOR X110
No okay.

PATIENT X110
No I think in the last six months or so, maybe longer.  But it's a very weird feeling.  Just I can't relax.  I never feel relaxed.  It's just a general feeling of malaise.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.

PATIENT X110
It's pretty bad.

DOCTOR X110
And how are you feeling since getting that tumor resected?

PATIENT X110
That didn't seem any different you know.

DOCTOR X110
Did you do okay with the surgery?

PATIENT X110
Yeah the surgery was good.

DOCTOR X110
But you're still feeling tired is that right?

PATIENT X110
Tired yeah.  Yeah I do feel tired.  

DOCTOR X110
Let's see.  I'm just looking back to see when we last saw the endocrine doctors.  

PATIENT X110
Yeah DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X110
Yeah, let's see here they checked your thyroid.

PATIENT X110
I'm taking a lot of medicines.

DOCTOR X110
Yeah you're on a bunch.

PATIENT X110
I wonder could some of those be causing a problem?

DOCTOR X110
Hmm.  Are you having any other problems?  

PATIENT X110
Um, well the last, yesterday I came down with this illness.  A very uh, almost like a flu, flu-like symptoms and it came yesterday.  Today I felt so bad I didn't know if I was going to be able to drive to the hospital you know.

DOCTOR X110
Okay what kind of symptoms like, you sick to your stomach, do you have fevers?

PATIENT X110
No fever I don't think but uh.  Yeah my stomach was upset this morning.  I had some nausea.

Stomach's upset alright.  Nausea and did you vomit?

PATIENT X110

DOCTOR X110
Okay do you have fevers?

PATIENT X110
I don't think so no.

DOCTOR X110
Chills?

PATIENT X110

DOCTOR X110
Okay.  Alright and what about um like muscle aches, muscle pains, those kind of problems?

PATIENT X110
No.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.

PATIENT X110

DOCTOR X110

PATIENT X110
Which I've had since yesterday.

DOCTOR X110
Yeah.

PATIENT X110
Yeah kind of achy.

DOCTOR X110
Uh-huh.  Let's see, I'm just looking here about when you saw the neurologist last time.  

PATIENT X110
Quite a while ago.

DOCTOR X110
So you saw them in January and.

PATIENT X110
Yeah she gave me gabapentin.

DOCTOR X110
Yeah.

PATIENT X110
I don't know if that does any good or not.

DOCTOR X110
Um, gabapentin can work really well if you're on the right amount.  How much are you taking now?

PATIENT X110
I'm taking two.

DOCTOR X110
You're taking two at night?  Uh do you want.

PATIENT X110
I changed it to three; I went up to three at night.

DOCTOR X110
Okay and is that helping at all?

PATIENT X110
I don't think it's any better than it was when I was taking one.

DOCTOR X110
Oh okay.  You don't think it's any better huh?

PATIENT X110
I beg your pardon?

DOCTOR X110
It's not any better?

PATIENT X110
No, I don't think so.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.  Alright.  Let's see.  

PATIENT X110
I just taking that new one.  I just started taking the @@@.

DOCTOR X110
Let's see, okay.  How's your vision?  Has it gotten better since they took that, removed the tumor?

PATIENT X110
Yeah it has.  My peripheral vision is better in my good eye.  I've only got one good eye.

DOCTOR X110
Alright.  So that did get better.

PATIENT X110
Yes.

DOCTOR X110
Good.

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
Alright.  Are you still seeing a cardiologist outside of here?

PATIENT X110
Uh no, no I'm not.

DOCTOR X110
You see cardiology here.

PATIENT X110
I haven't seen a cardiologist for quite a while.  I don't remember when my last appointment was uh.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.

PATIENT X110
My blood pressure is good.

DOCTOR X110
You probably do have, you're just right on the borderline of diabetes and uh right now it's not really bad enough that we would probably treat it.

PATIENT X110
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X110
But we do want to keep an eye on it.

PATIENT X110
Okay.

DOCTOR X110
Let's see.  Are you urinating okay?  You're following with Urology how's that?

PATIENT X110
Yeah I'm taking that new medication.  I just started that a couple days ago, tolterodine and that helps.

DOCTOR X110
It does.

PATIENT X110
Yeah because I was having to go every hour or so.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.

PATIENT X110
And now I'm only about two or three times a night.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.

PATIENT X110
So that seemed to help.

DOCTOR X110
Let's see.  Your cholesterol looks good.  Check the CBC alright.  So we can help you out with this numbness and tingling a little bit, that would.

PATIENT X110
Oh that would be great.

DOCTOR X110
That would be the best thing.

PATIENT X110
Yes.

DOCTOR X110
Have a seat up here for me.

PATIENT X110
I really hate that feeling.

DOCTOR X110
Well how's your wife doing?

PATIENT X110
She's doing great.

DOCTOR X110
Sometimes she's here with you.

PATIENT X110
I beg your pardon?

DOCTOR X110
Some days I've seen her here with you.

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
How is like your memory and everything like that doing?

PATIENT X110
Pretty @@@.

DOCTOR X110
Slip off your glasses for me.  Look straight ahead.  Open your mouth.  Okay.  @@@.  Are you uh doing most things on your own, like your day to day stuff, or does your wife help you out?

PATIENT X110
Oh yeah.  I do most things on my own.

DOCTOR X110
Okay take some big breaths, again alright, relax.  Stomach is okay?

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
Any blood in the stool?

PATIENT X110
No.

DOCTOR X110
Black stool?

PATIENT X110
No.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X110
Do you think that anything can be done for that feeling I have?

DOCTOR X110
I don't know.  I mean that can be a tough thing to treat.  I mean gabapentin can be a good drug but the problem is you have to get it up to a high enough dose or it doesn't do much.

PATIENT X110
Oh.  Okay, well I'm taking three presently.

DOCTOR X110
I know.  Let me go chat with one of my bosses back here.  I'll be right back in okay.

PATIENT X110
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT: 95:45  DOCTOR IN:  98:41)

DOCTOR X110
Thank you sir.  Taking a nap there?

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
You know, if you want to, I'm waiting for one of the attendings, one of my bosses back there.  He's in the middle of something.

PATIENT X110
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X110
Um so if you don't mind I can go ahead and have you kind of get the check-out process started.  Um just don't leave um.  After you check out, you know the Waiting Room up front?

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
You know what I'm talking about?  Can you just wait there until I come and talk to you?  Um I don't you to, I feel bad you having to sit here um.

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
Um you know I think it might speed it up a little bit you getting out of here and getting home uh.

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
Uh I guess he's in the middle of admitting a patient to the hospital.

PATIENT X110
How long do you think it'll be?

DOCTOR X110
Five minutes.

PATIENT X110
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X110
But I just hate for you to have to sit here so I was thinking, what I'm thinking about doing is uh you know you're due for some blood testing uh, just to check the sugar and the cholesterol.

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
Um and I'm gonna talk to him about the neuropathy pain to see if he agrees with.  See part of the thing is you're also seeing Neurology, who are kind of helping managing that so I don't want to step on their toes and change what they were doing but I think we may be able to help you out somewhere.  Uh.

PATIENT X110
Yeah.

DOCTOR X110
Let's uh, if you want, as long as you promise me that you're not gonna escape on me before I talk to you, this may just help speed things up.  So if you want to go check out okay and uh then I'll come find you in the Waiting Room.

PATIENT X110
In the Waiting Room okay.

DOCTOR X110
Yep, sound good?

PATIENT X110
Okay there's one thing that I was supposed to, the nurse left me a note here.

DOCTOR X110
Oh yeah what's this?

PATIENT X110
I see that the lisinopril, the lisinopril is not on the list.  

DOCTOR X110
@@@ list.  So it looks like lisinopril needs to be added to your online prescription list.  You've been taking this @@@ since your tumor surgery and your blood pressure is stable.

PATIENT X110
Yeah she uh, she orders it on the internet and she says it's not on the list.

DOCTOR X110
Where do you get it?  Do you get it from the VA or you get it from somewhere else?

PATIENT X110
No, from the VA.

DOCTOR X110
Cause I don't think you've been getting it from us.  Did they give it to you at xxx?

PATIENT X110
Uh I'm pretty sure I've been getting it from the VA.

DOCTOR X110
It says since your tumor surgery, so I wonder if they put you on that at xxx.

PATIENT X110
Oh maybe.

DOCTOR X110
Hmm.  

PATIENT X110
You know what I think it's on my list.

DOCTOR X110
I don't think it's on your list.  @@@ potassium, @@@.

PATIENT X110
Oh I guess not.

DOCTOR X110
So you must be getting it from somewhere else.

PATIENT X110
Okay.

DOCTOR X110
Okay.

PATIENT X110
Can you add that to the list cause she wants to order all my medications.  She usually gets it from the VA on the internet yeah.

DOCTOR X110
Alright and your blood pressure was good today huh?  Yeah.

PATIENT X110

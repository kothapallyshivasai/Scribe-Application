DOCTOR X199
Okay.  So what is new?  It's been what since October?

PATIENT X199
Yeah, we had an appointment, they made an earlier appointment but uh somehow it got crossed up or something cause when I came in for the blood tests I asked them about the appointment and they go no, something got criss-crossed so they made me another appointment for now.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.

PATIENT X199
Which is alright.

DOCTOR X199
How you been doing?

PATIENT X199
Alright.  Last couple days I got a little bit of the chills.  I don't know what the, picked something up.  Well and I'm outside you know, when I'm inside I tend to feel alright.  Usually I'm working outside when I, I drop stuff off at constructions sites, you know materials and stuff like that for the.

DOCTOR X199
Okay, okay.  Yeah what kind of work do you do?

PATIENT X199
I drive a delivery truck and mostly right now I'm driving for an electrical company so I'm you know delivering electrical conduit, wiring and stuff like that.

DOCTOR X199
Alright.  How's your diabetes been doing?

PATIENT X199
Uh.

DOCTOR X199
Do you check your blood sugar ever?

PATIENT X199
No I usually don't do, I usually don't check it myself.  I was in for the blood test last week.  I don't know if the results came back.

DOCTOR X199
They did.  Yeah I'll go through that with you.  You've been feeling well though as far as not having any trouble with nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT X199
Uh, I did about a month ago.  I had it for like, I think I must have picked up some kind of a, ate something bad or something cause it was like a 24 hour thing.  But normally I've been doing pretty good and feeling pretty good.  Appetite's good.

DOCTOR X199
Good.  How's your weight?

PATIENT X199
Uh it's pretty steady.

DOCTOR X199
Wow.

PATIENT X199
Stays pretty much at the.

DOCTOR X199
That's right, exactly the same.

PATIENT X199
Yeah, for a long time.

DOCTOR X199
Good.  I mean I'd like you to lose 10 pounds but as long as you're not going up.

PATIENT X199
Yeah I should probably lose 20 at least.

DOCTOR X199
Alright, what medicines are you taking, anything?

PATIENT X199
Uh yeah I brought some of the stuff uh; well we're taking the metformin.

DOCTOR X199
Yeah.

PATIENT X199
They tell me to take two, usually I just take one.  Usually I've been averaging probably one a day.

DOCTOR X199
So this one you take it twice a day so once in the morning and once at night.

PATIENT X199
Yeah.

DOCTOR X199
Alright.  Omeprazole, simvastatin.

PATIENT X199
Yeah a doctor gave me something.  He said my cholesterol was a little high so he gave me something for the, for the cholesterol I guess.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.  Do you still take an aspirin every day?

PATIENT X199
Uh probably every other day.

DOCTOR X199
Yeah.

PATIENT X199
You know the low dose one I just take it like uh.

DOCTOR X199
Any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?

PATIENT X199
No, no they're pretty good.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.

PATIENT X199
I always make toast in the morning and it always comes, you know it always comes out hot, I pull it out.

DOCTOR X199
@@@.  Well, here's your blood tests, we can go through it.

PATIENT X199
Okay.

DOCTOR X199
Prostate test was normal.

PATIENT X199
Really.

DOCTOR X199
Yep.  We'll do a.

PATIENT X199
Terrific.

DOCTOR X199
Which helps to identify problems with the prostate.

PATIENT X199
Wow.

DOCTOR X199
Um kidney function is normal.  Your glucose was right at the borderline so what we could consider diabetes and we already know that @@@ fine.  Liver function is good.  This was back in a little bit, even further back like in October so you've had some urine tested for, showed some reflection of diabetes and then the cholesterol which was a little bit high back then.  So the things that we want to do now.  Now do you get your blood checked with that outside doctor?

PATIENT X199
Uh, when I go to the office I think the last time I was probably there about a month and a half ago or so.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.

PATIENT X199
They did a blood test and it was like, I think he said it was like 130 or something like that.  Like my blood count.

DOCTOR X199
Yeah.  Well, I want to avoid having too many cooks in the kitchen.

PATIENT X199
Yeah.

DOCTOR X199
But there's information that we need to share that that doctor and myself or.

PATIENT X199
Yeah.

DOCTOR X199
Or we'll have to have you repeat some of the blood tests here.

PATIENT X199
Okay.

DOCTOR X199
So if you have any blood work there, bring it into me.

PATIENT X199
Okay.

DOCTOR X199
Uh if you're willing though I'll get some blood tests here.

PATIENT X199
Sure.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.

PATIENT X199
Well how did the blood test last week show up for the fasting?

DOCTOR X199
Yeah that was good.

PATIENT X199
It did.

DOCTOR X199
Yeah now they didn't do um a cholesterol.

PATIENT X199
Oh okay but they did the uh.

DOCTOR X199
They did the prostate, the kidney and liver and um electrolytes.

PATIENT X199
Hmm.

DOCTOR X199
But no cholesterol and @@@ since you started on that medication @@@.

PATIENT X199
Yeah he said it wasn't, I think he said it was around 202 or maybe it was 220, maybe it was 220.

DOCTOR X199
It was 208 here.

PATIENT X199
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X199
But for you we want it significantly lower than that, particularly the LDL which is the bad cholesterol.

PATIENT X199
Okay.

DOCTOR X199
Come on up here, I'll take a listen to you.

PATIENT X199
Okay.  I got the results of the CAT scan; I had the CAT scan done.

DOCTOR X199
What for?

PATIENT X199
Cause when I was here uh, doing an evaluation for the Agent Orange, they wanted me to take a chest x-ray and something showed up on the chest x-ray.

DOCTOR X199
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X199
So uh this is like the third CAT scan I've had and they've been pretty much unchanged I guess since the first one.

DOCTOR X199
Can I make a copy of this?

PATIENT X199
You can keep that.

DOCTOR X199
Okay thanks.

PATIENT X199
Yeah I had them make a copy so I could bring one here.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.

PATIENT X199
The other thing the doctor said that I had gallstones.

DOCTOR X199
Yes you do.  A lot of people do.

PATIENT X199
So it's you know and they says you know you got gallstones.  I'm like really.  I says you know.

DOCTOR X199
A lot of people have them and they never have symptoms.

PATIENT X199
Yeah.

DOCTOR X199
They never cause problems and so we don't mess with them.  That's the problem you go looking for stuff and find stuff.

PATIENT X199
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X199
Would you be able to roll this up for me?

PATIENT X199
Sure.  I don't know if I can get it high enough or not.  I could take it off if you want.

DOCTOR X199
@@@.  

PATIENT X199
NAME gave me something for a research thing when I saw him today.  You know what I'm going to take this off.

DOCTOR X199
@@@.

PATIENT X199
I've heard @@@.  Something about the @@@ monitor that.

DOCTOR X199
Yeah.  Often when you have an infection in your lungs, you know you'll have a pneumonia or something in your life.

PATIENT X199
Oh.

DOCTOR X199
Or you might get some scar tissue in there and it builds up.  It looks fine on the x-ray.  At least the copy I pulled up, I don't know that that is, so we'll do a chest, usually it's nothing.

PATIENT X199
DOCTOR was good at that stuff.  It's like you know, sometimes I get that a urinating during a lot of the, @@@.

DOCTOR X199
So you're telling me you have some urine symptoms?

PATIENT X199
Yeah like uh, well over the last couple of days I kind of had the chills and stuff a little bit and I've been going to the washroom quite a bit in the last couple days and I got uh.

DOCTOR X199
Is it burning?

PATIENT X199
No.

DOCTOR X199
No blood in your urine?

PATIENT X199
No I don't notice any blood.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.  We'll do a urine test today.  Deep breath. @@@.  

PATIENT X199
Yeah that is a little elevated.  I figured 96.8 but its 98.6 isn't it?

DOCTOR X199
Yeah.

PATIENT X199
There you go, that's why I'm not a doctor.  @@@.

DOCTOR X199
Uh-huh.  Alright well your blood tests were very good.  I think @@@ I'll have you come in, the same thing like you did this time, maybe a week before you come in.

PATIENT X199
Okay.

DOCTOR X199
And we'll plan on doing that four months from now.

PATIENT X199
But continue on the metformin right?

DOCTOR X199
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT X199
Like I said I been taking it, generally I'm taking like one a day.

DOCTOR X199
I think you can stay on it.

PATIENT X199
Is it working out that way though, doing the one?

DOCTOR X199
We'll just do one blood test today and then I'll call you if there are any changes.  Do you want to do it on your way out?

PATIENT X199
Sure.  Cause I remember at one time I think I was taking two of the metformin, I was taking some other medicine, it wasn't metformin it was something else and I was really getting like the sweats and constant urinating and stuff and they told me to stop taking the medicine.

DOCTOR X199
Okay.  Well, that could be probably because the blood sugar was too high or too low with the sugar.

PATIENT X199
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X199
I'm not quite sure though.   This test that we're going to do today will help us get a sense about that.

PATIENT X199
Okay.

DOCTOR X199
Have you seen an eye doctor in the last year?

PATIENT X199
Yeah as a matter of fact I had the test here.

DOCTOR X199
Well there you go.

PATIENT X199
Yeah they said it was, they said it looked pretty good.  That's what she told me, I don't know.

DOCTOR X199
Yeah it looks likes everything was okay too.

PATIENT X199
She said, I told her I just use the readers you know for like reading the newspaper or something, small print stuff and she said that's fine.

DOCTOR X199
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT X199
Alright.

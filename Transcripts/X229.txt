DOCTOR X229
Hi.

PATIENT X229  
She's giving her sister directions.  So DOCTOR how have you been?

DOCTOR X229
I've been good, how have you been?

PATIENT X229
Well you know.  I'm fighting the after effects.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.  So everything, but the virus is bothering, what other things have been bothering you?

PATIENT X229
What about the esophagus you know.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
And it bothers if I am eating something like that but uh.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
And this lousy little cough I got.  

DOCTOR X229
I saw.

PATIENT X229
xxx.

DOCTOR X229
Anything from the heartburn, is anything helping you?  Do we have you on any coating?

PATIENT X229
They gave me that three in one thing, that pink stuff.

SECOND PERSON X229
Hello doctor.

DOCTOR X229
Oh hi, how you doing?

PATIENT X229
It's okay but it doesn't last you know.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
It's quick dissolving like.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.  I think a viscus lidocaine that might help and you're completely done with the radiation and at this point you have had the chemo.

PATIENT X229
Everything is done.

DOCTOR X229
And they're going to do a CAT scan in a couple months.

PATIENT X229
In three months, yeah a couple months.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
They couldn't find anything, everything is gone.

DOCTOR X229
Great.

PATIENT X229
Yeah, God almighty yeah.

DOCTOR X229
You know it's been a.

PATIENT X229
Tough fight.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah it has, especially with that pneumonia and everything.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.  I'd like you to go through and see if there are some of those medications I could stop taking.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
You know there's so many of them.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
I'm losing track.

DOCTOR X229
Oh I know.  Alright so, let's see.  So you need the magnesium cause it's been low.

PATIENT X229
Definitely so.

DOCTOR X229
I think might be low because of the chemo.  Um and then you're on this Neutra-Phos which is the packet.

PATIENT X229
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X229
So I think that's okay.  Um your cough syrup.

PATIENT X229
I gotta have that.

DOCTOR X229
We'll continue that.  Tramadol are you taking that at all?

SECOND PERSON X229
That's for the pain, not at all now.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
No.

DOCTOR X229
Um okay, get rid of that.  Albuterol inhaler, that inhaler has that been helping at all?

PATIENT X229
For what, what is that for?

DOCTOR X229
Like the puffer you take.

PATIENT X229
Oh I haven't been using that.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah has it ever helped you?  Alright we can get rid of it.

PATIENT X229
No.

DOCTOR X229
Uh you know I remember.  It's one of those things it's not going to hurt, but it doesn't sound like it's doing anything for you.  Uh the omeprazole or Prilosec?

PATIENT X229
Prilosec I need it.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah, you need that.  Uh okay, are you still taking the, there's some of these chemo medications they gave you the prochlorperazine for nausea.

PATIENT X229
I didn't have any nausea on it.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah you had some in the beginning.

PATIENT X229
Just in the beginning.

SECOND PERSON X229
You know what that actually made him more nauseous.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X229
You was taking that remember?

PATIENT X229
Yeah I know.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
I'd take it before I'd eat and before I could eat I was throwing it up.

DOCTOR X229
Okay, atenolol?

PATIENT X229
Yeah I have to have that.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah blood pressure.  So Lasix?

PATIENT X229
What is that?

DOCTOR X229
That's uh furosemide, it's a water pill.

SECOND PERSON X229
Oh he's not taking it right now.  The doctors told him to stop it.

PATIENT X229
To stop it.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.  Uh the Colace or Docusate for stools, for constipation?

PATIENT X229
No I need help there.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
Those are not working.

DOCTOR X229
Okay so you need something stronger.

SECOND PERSON X229
But they used to work from the beginning though right?

PATIENT X229
No, no, no.  It's just the.

SECOND PERSON X229
For the very beginning they do a little bit.

PATIENT X229
Yeah the first time I took them, I thought oh this is great, but it didn't happen, it didn't happen.

DOCTOR X229
@@@ and then do you need any of these uh dressings and things?  They pulled the PICC line out right?

SECOND PERSON X229
Yes they did that.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
So you don't need any of these alcohol.

PATIENT X229
No.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X229
Can you eliminate all this from the computer so when they give a print-out we'll have just @@@.

PATIENT X229
He's doing it now.

DOCTOR X229
@@@.

PATIENT X229
Well he'll get a print out but after he gets rid of them.

DOCTOR X229
You don't need any of this IV stuff.

SECOND PERSON X229
No.

PATIENT X229
No.

DOCTOR X229
Still on the metformin?

PATIENT X229
Yes.

DOCTOR X229
The simvastatin?

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Flomax?

PATIENT X229
Flomax I don't know.

SECOND PERSON X229
What was that for?

DOCTOR X229
It's for trouble, if you're having trouble urinating um.

PATIENT X229
No in fact I urinate too much at night.

DOCTOR X229
Well that's the thing; you're waking up to urinate?

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Well this is supposed to help you empty your, when you go you empty your bladder all the way.  Sometimes what happens if the prostate is big you have and it's not emptying all the way you get just kind of, you're always halfway full and you end up going all the time.

SECOND PERSON X229
And that makes you get up all the time.

PATIENT X229
But it seems like I go enough until I empty out as much as I can.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.  Uh I'll leave it on there, if you don't want it.

PATIENT X229
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X229
For now and you could and then you're giving yourself and these are just the insulin and stuff um.  Probably have you get a diabetes check.

PATIENT X229
Oh I want to tell you about that, remember with the glipizide.

SECOND PERSON X229
Glipizide.

DOCTOR X229
Glipizide.

PATIENT X229
Glipizide, I'm taking two pills in the morning and one in the evening.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
And that's working out beautifully.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
You know remember we were going real low.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
So a half wasn't doing it.

SECOND PERSON X229
You were right then.

PATIENT X229
Remember we tried a half and it wasn't doing.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
So I started a full pill and that's been working great.  In the morning I'm 109, 111.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
Right on the number.

DOCTOR X229
So 20 in the morning and 10 at night.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Alright and then the metformin still.

PATIENT X229
Yeah it's working.

DOCTOR X229
Alright.  Now for the stool softener uh, so you're taking the Docusate.  You want to try something, have you ever tried MiraLax?  Uh it's something you know, it's kind of something to take it's like a last resort.  So here, let me give, I'm going to give you a pill that'll keep things, will get things moving.

PATIENT X229
Okay.

DOCTOR X229
Okay so the Docusate is just a stool softener and it's not.

PATIENT X229
It's not.

DOCTOR X229
It's not a very strong one um.  Then there's a laxative called Senna which you can take in a pill form.

PATIENT X229
Okay.

DOCTOR X229
So I'm gonna give you that one and then I'm gonna also give you a prescription for MiraLax, which is if things get backed up you can take uh one of these MiraLax things and that's uh, that's to get things moving okay.

PATIENT X229
See I've been drinking prune juice.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
And that helps.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah that'll help too.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
But uh this is you know a little bit stronger um.  I would keep you on the Colace, you can just take that every day, it'll just keep things a little moving but.

PATIENT X229
Cause I normally don't go like every three days or four days sometimes.  That's been a problem too.

SECOND PERSON X229
Eat some more prunes. @@@.

DOCTOR X229
Do you want this delivered or do you want to pick it up today?

PATIENT X229
Uh they can deliver it; I got enough stuff to keep me going.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
I got some prune juice left.

DOCTOR X229
Alright.  Then the MiraLax, polyethylene glycol is what it's called.  It'll come in these packets that you just put in a glass of water and just take that as needed for constipation.  So the cough, you know we're, there's not much else we can do for it.  I just hope that it gets a little bit better after things calm down a little bit and um if it's, you know we'll keep the cough syrup going and uh you know.  I think you know it's probably, it is probably from the mass and we know that.  I don't think it's a pneumonia.

PATIENT X229
Oh no, it's definitely that.

DOCTOR X229
And uh.

PATIENT X229
Cause there's hard any phlegm with it.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
It's just.

DOCTOR X229
It's just irritating.

PATIENT X229
Tickling and you know.

DOCTOR X229
So I, you know I think the best thing to do is the cough syrup for that um.  I don't think DOCTOR had any further ideas.

PATIENT X229
Well she sent me what four bottles of cough syrup.

SECOND PERSON X229
Uh-huh yesterday.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.  Does the cough syrup help?

PATIENT X229
I haven't started it yet.

DOCTOR X229
Okay, so we'll try that.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Um.

PATIENT X229
I got four bottles.  Don't order me anymore.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah, actually you know, he took it before.  But you gotta take it I guess every four hours regularly, you know for it to help.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah and it's going to be this stuff that's a little bit sedating um so you just got to watch it.  You know, don't drive with it if you're taking it you know.

SECOND PERSON X229
No.  Is it addictive doctor?  No?

DOCTOR X229
Not really um.  It's just uh, it might @@@ but there's not.

SECOND PERSON X229
@@@ okay, I had bronchitis a couple weeks ago and I took the antibiotics and all of the and I still had a bad cough you know and I started taking NyQuil at night, like a teaspoon of it before I go to bed.  So for ten nights I'm sleeping nice without waking up.

DOCTOR X229
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON X229
Well the one night I didn't take it, I woke up early.

DOCTOR X229
No I'm not too worried about him becoming uh.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.  And you know me when it comes to medicines.  As soon as I can stop it, I stop it.

DOCTOR X229
If you didn't need it, I mean it.

PATIENT X229
Right exactly.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
Right.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.  Are you taking anything for the, what are you taking for the heartburn and uh esophageal?

PATIENT X229
The syrup?

DOCTOR X229
Yeah nothing okay.

PATIENT X229
They gave me, like I say this pink stuff in this big bottle.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
But that ain't doing it.  I mean it's okay for about ten minutes or so and if I would go out to dinner or something, by the time I'm finished with my dinner it's doing nothing at all.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.  I mean I think that's all from the radiation you know.

PATIENT X229
Well that's what everybody said.

DOCTOR X229
It'll be getting better.

SECOND PERSON X229
How long does it take a year or?

DOCTOR X229
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X229
No not that long.

DOCTOR X229
Your last treatment was on when, it was about uh.

SECOND PERSON X229
Five, six weeks ago, something like.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.  Okay so you still have that bottle of pink stuff?

PATIENT X229
Yes.

DOCTOR X229
So when you go out to dinner, I mean you can take it and it'll last for about ten minutes okay um and do you have pain pills that you can take?

PATIENT X229
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X229
He has Vicodin.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah sometimes the Vicodin will help a little bit if you take it prior.

PATIENT X229
Prior.

DOCTOR X229
To meals you know and just try to kind of brace, just till it's @@@ down, kind of like this.

PATIENT X229
Cause they said that can also cause the.

DOCTOR X229
Constipation.

PATIENT X229
That was funny.

SECOND PERSON X229
@@@.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X229
Better start eating more vegetables and fruits though.

PATIENT X229
Oh you and your vegetables.

DOCTOR X229
But I'm hoping that that should get better.  The more we move away from the radiation.  It's just lingering a little while.

PATIENT X229
But you know I can't imagine how that pain is when I start eating and it locks up there you know when I swallow.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
And it gets down to a certain point and then I could feel it like you know there.  If I try to sip some water to get it down.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
Well when the water hits it, oh it's like somebody shoved a poker down there, hot poker.

SECOND PERSON X229
Oh my God.

PATIENT X229
It's really hard and I don't know what to do with it.

DOCTOR X229
Okay.

PATIENT X229
Now it does go down.  It'll finally let go and then the pain is gone.

DOCTOR X229
Alright well let me see if I can talk to, I'll talk to some of our cancer doctors and see if there's something else that we can think of uh.

PATIENT X229
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X229
After this, um I'm actually on the Hemoc Service right now so I'll see doctors, a couple of the doctors a little later today.  I'll see if they have any other ideas of what we can do and how long we can expect this to go on.

PATIENT X229
Oh that would be nice.

DOCTOR X229
Uh I don't know if I'm, I mean I don't want to promise anything.

PATIENT X229
Oh right.

DOCTOR X229
Um and uh alright no fevers or chills or anything like that?  Uh cough is pretty much dry at this point.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Uh alright and uh.

PATIENT X229
I mean I'm putting on weight.  I put on a few more pounds.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
And I'm doing a lot more things that I couldn't do before.

DOCTOR X229
Okay, great.

PATIENT X229
Yeah so.

DOCTOR X229
That's the key.

PATIENT X229
So it's working out.

DOCTOR X229
Alright.

PATIENT X229
Slowly.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah so @@@ up a little bit.

SECOND PERSON X229
What's the weight, how much he weigh now?

DOCTOR X229
149.2, so it was 147 at the lowest.

SECOND PERSON X229
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X229
So it's starting up.

PATIENT X229
Yeah we're getting it up there.

DOCTOR X229
Alright want to just have a seat up here?

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Give me a deep breath.  Okay, breathe normally.  Any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT X229
No.  I'm doing okay.

DOCTOR X229
Alright uh so.  I'm gonna go talk to the boss and see if they're gonna want to do this.

PATIENT X229
Okay.

DOCTOR X229
Give them a specimen at some point, so I'll show you where it is when I come back.

PATIENT X229
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:11  DOCTOR IN:  59:02)

DOCTOR X229
Alright so, do you have any antibiotics at home in case you need them?

PATIENT X229
The what?

SECOND PERSON X229
Antibiotics, we don't have any more.

DOCTOR X229
Okay, well you know if you start having fevers, chills or anything like that uh you know, if that happens.

PATIENT X229
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X229
You're at risk for getting pneumonias okay, you understand.  Because this obstruction, that's what's causing the cough.  But sometimes if you can't clear up, you're not going to be, you know what I mean so you're at risk for getting pneumonias and you might not be able to tolerate it.

PATIENT X229
Well we just took the antibiotics for seven days.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah okay.  So the same antibiotic that you took.

SECOND PERSON X229
Well if you can give him another prescription then.

DOCTOR X229
And we still want you to, but I want you to be.  You know if you start having any fevers or chills or the cough is getting worse.  If you're just feeling like body aches or feeling sick you need to call us immediately okay and then we'll get you some antibiotics.

SECOND PERSON X229
Oh you can't prescribe him any right now?

DOCTOR X229
Well I can give it, if you want I can give you, what I can do is have them mail you a prescription, so you can have it at home and take it in case you need it.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah that'll be good.

DOCTOR X229
But I want you, if you do get to the point where you're gonna take them, I want you to call us yeah.

PATIENT X229
If I have to take them I'll get hold of you.

DOCTOR X229
So let us know if you end up taking the antibiotics, just in case.

PATIENT X229
So when do I get over this hump with the pneumonia?

DOCTOR X229
Well no, no I'm just saying, I don't think you have a pneumonia right now.

PATIENT X229
Oh.

SECOND PERSON X229
No but he needs the, it's when the, like when he won't be susceptible anymore.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah your lungs are, you know you have a blockage in one of them so you know cause the lung comes down like this you know um, breaks off a couple of different ways.

SECOND PERSON X229
And the blockage is still from the tumor right?

DOCTOR X229
Tumor and just scar.  You know we got this.

SECOND PERSON X229
The scar tissue.

DOCTOR X229
From all the radiation so you know this is kind of where the tumor was, it was in this ball park like on the right side so you got the tumor all shrunk down, so it's shriveled down but this airway here is still blocked you know partly.  So you're, you know what I'm worried about is if you get another infection you know, past this blockage, like so all the bacteria's down here, like just sits here and then you know and you're not able to clear it because it's blocked then we need to make sure you're getting the antibiotics okay.

PATIENT X229
Okay.

DOCTOR X229
But I think um oh um, but I don't think you need any now you know.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
You will know yourself if you're getting sick.

SECOND PERSON X229
So he should be very careful coming in contact with people that are sick.

DOCTOR X229
Well yeah I think that's uh.

PATIENT X229
But that goes for everybody.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.  Um.

SECOND PERSON X229
So wash your hands often and all that.

PATIENT X229
I do you know I always do that.

DOCTOR X229
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X229
Yeah.

PATIENT X229
Every place I go I squirt.

DOCTOR X229
So I'm going to give you a script for that just in case you need it.

PATIENT X229
That'd be good.

DOCTOR X229
To help kind of.

PATIENT X229
Cause sometimes you now you try to call and you can't get through and then.

DOCTOR X229
Oh I know, that's what.

SECOND PERSON X229
Or it's a weekend.

PATIENT X229
Yeah.

DOCTOR X229
Alright and then let's say four months or if you need something else you know you can always call for something.

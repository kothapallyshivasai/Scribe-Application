Like they say some can cause pneumonia.

DOCTOR X586
Yeah there's definitely some medications that can put you at higher risk.

PATIENT X586

They don't usually cause it but they make you at risk for it.

PATIENT X586
Yeah.

DOCTOR X586
Yeah, sure.  Um I don't know let's see.  Let's see which medicines you're on.  Well um albuterol is not going to do that.  This is for your gout, the allopurinol and @@@ is for your blood pressure that's okay.  You're using artificial tears, the capsaicin cream, eye drops, those are all okay.  Colchicine um, if you have problems.  The miconazole for the fungal infection in your mouth.  Flunisolide okay.  Uh that's a steroid that you spray in the nose yes, yeah.  Steroids sometimes lower immunity um but usually if you put them in your nose and not.

Sometimes a humidifier can help with that.  Um it can, if you get the air a little bit wetter, if the air feels dry and everything.

PATIENT X586
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X586
Then it makes the mucous dry and then it's harder to cough up and if you have a humidifier or if not um you know you can boil some water on the stove and breathe in the steam that might help too.  So I'm gonna give you this medicine to help break it up.  You want it mailed to you or do you want to pick it up?

FIRST DOCTOR X586

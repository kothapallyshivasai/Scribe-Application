DOCTOR X516
You haven't?

PATIENT X516

DOCTOR X516
Okay.  Your blood pressure was fine uh right now.  You're not on a lot of blood pressure medicines, just the one.

PATIENT X516
@@@.

DOCTOR X516
That's fine um let's see.  And we checked your cholesterol back in January and it was okay.  Um when do you see the urology doctors next?  For the prostate?

PATIENT X516
I don't know.  I don't know.

DOCTOR X516
And you saw in October.  They just want to see you every uh.

Every six months I think.

DOCTOR X516
Every year.

PATIENT X516
Every year alright good, that's fine.

DOCTOR X516
So that's good so you're fine for a while.

PATIENT X516
That’s fine.

DOCTOR X516
Um let's see.  So you said the last time you mentioned that your calcium was high when you had um, you had um @@@ they test your calcium and the nerve systems.  Do you remember talking about that?  They checked um.

PATIENT X516
Yeah they did and they said it was for the heart.

DOCTOR X516
And it was a little high um here but not too high, um just barely over um.  So they said it's just a tad high um in the blood.

PATIENT X516
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X516
And they checked um a few other things um and it looks like you have what's called hyperparathyroidism.  So you have the thyroid gland in here and inside, kind of behind it, it's just there's these four small, they are like this big, they’re real soft.  

PATIENT X516
Hmm.

DOCTOR X516
Um there are four little glands behind the thyroid called the parathyroid um and that is something that, that's the gland that regulates the calcium in our bodies.

PATIENT X516
Okay.

DOCTOR X516
Okay and sometimes for whatever reason um this will, it just is over active okay.  Um we can send you to the endocrine doctors to have them talk to you more to see if you can do something about it.  Do you want to do that?

PATIENT X516
Is it that severe?  I mean.

DOCTOR X516
Uh it's not real high.

PATIENT X516
Is it something I have to look at?

DOCTOR X516
It's not real high but it might be worth talking to them about it to see if they think.  You know they may just say follow it, there's nothing we could do right now.

PATIENT X516
Okay.

DOCTOR X516
But.

PATIENT X516

DOCTOR X516
Okay and that's where.

PATIENT X516

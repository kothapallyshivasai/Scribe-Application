DOCTOR X453
Yeah.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
Alright let me ask you a few questions okay.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
Uh your sugars, any low sugars?  What's the lowest your sugar's been?

PATIENT X453
90 something.

DOCTOR X453
Okay, okay.  Alright cause I don't, like even @@@.

PATIENT X453
I don't want to go down lower cause, eat something to bring it back up or @@@.

DOCTOR X453
Right. Um I don't want like anything lower than 80 something okay.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
Um what's the highest your sugar's been.

PATIENT X453
The highest since I been taking these medication, uh close to 300.

DOCTOR X453
Oh.

PATIENT X453
No 200, 200 and that's when I first started.

DOCTOR X453
Okay, okay @@@.

PATIENT X453
It's been under 200.

DOCTOR X453
Oh that's pretty good.

PATIENT X453
It's been under 200.

DOCTOR X453
Pretty good.

PATIENT X453
Now there's some days that it might go up a little, over 200 or something like that but.

DOCTOR X453
Okay.

PATIENT X453
The majority is under 200.

DOCTOR X453
Wow that's excellent.

PATIENT X453
Yeah I see a difference too.

DOCTOR X453
Better energy.

PATIENT X453
Yeah.

DOCTOR X453
Not drinking so much.

PATIENT X453
Right.

DOCTOR X453
Good I'm glad.

PATIENT X453
At nighttime too I.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah.

PATIENT X453
It used to be three, four times, now it's a couple you know.

DOCTOR X453
And when your sugars are that high it's what we call @@@ to make you pee basically.

PATIENT X453
Yeah.

DOCTOR X453
Sugar pools in your urine and then it makes a lot more urine basically.

PATIENT X453
She was telling me that the metformin, she gave me the metformin 1000.

DOCTOR X453
Twice a day.

PATIENT X453
Twice a day right.

DOCTOR X453
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X453
Because if I do work, if I work out well that is going to go to the bone right?

DOCTOR X453
No exactly.

PATIENT X453
Or it's good for bones or what's the reason behind the fact that I got to go out and walk around and you know like do four or five blocks and everything like that?

DOCTOR X453
Well exercise by itself will help you lower your sugars.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
But uh it might help what we call, so metformin is what we call a sensitizer.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
It makes your body more receptive to the insulin that you're earlier.

PATIENT X453
Oh gotcha okay.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah so um so if you take metformin and you work out and it basically helps your body and @@@ the sugar in your blood, it goes to the muscle, everywhere else, supports the liver and things like that.  So instead of hanging in around your blood, which is bad, it goes to where it should go basically like the liver.

PATIENT X453
So a good workout would be, consist of what, sitting up, standing up, walking around, two blocks, three blocks, exactly.

DOCTOR X453
@@@.

PATIENT X453
I mean walking, uh going around the block one time or what?  So before I take the pill, after I take the pill or?

DOCTOR X453
@@@.

PATIENT X453
What way works better?

DOCTOR X453
Uh it doesn't matter.  The idea for exercise is consistency and duration.  Um it doesn't matter what you do but the idea is to raise your heart rate for at least 30 minutes a day.

PATIENT X453
Consistently.

DOCTOR X453
Consistently.  Uh but it doesn't have to be @@@ day.

PATIENT X453
That would be what, that would how?

DOCTOR X453
If you like to swim, if you like to walk really fast.

PATIENT X453
I'll be doing it; I just finished taking a course on swimming.

DOCTOR X453
Great.

PATIENT X453
Okay, learning how to swim.

DOCTOR X453
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X453
And I'm going to college over at @@@.

DOCTOR X453
Great.

PATIENT X453
And I took a class and then now for some reason they shut it down for just the @@@.

DOCTOR X453
Oh.

PATIENT X453
Cause of safety hazard.

DOCTOR X453
Okay.

PATIENT X453
Some reason, something to do with safety.

DOCTOR X453
Any aerobic activity, swimming, walking really fast, treadmills, Stairmasters, elliptical training, things like that.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
This will help bring up your heart rate, help you burn some calories and work on your muscles.  Cause muscles, when you work on them, they get stronger and then they give you more energy which is good.

PATIENT X453
That's good.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah exactly so the glucose that's hanging around in your blood gets burned off by your muscles.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
Okay.  So I'm glad you asked me about that um otherwise I'm going to continue things, except for increasing the blood pressure medication, I'm going to continue.  Tell you what; do you have a good phone number I could reach you at?

PATIENT X453
Yeah.  My wife's.

DOCTOR X453
Oh she'll get on your case then.

PATIENT X453
Yeah.

DOCTOR X453
Okay.

PATIENT X453

DOCTOR X453

PATIENT X453

DOCTOR X453
Okay.  As soon as we get the blood results today.  Sometime maybe in the evening today or tomorrow or in the afternoon today I'll call you with the results and based on what they are, I may change your diabetes medications okay.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
But.

PATIENT X453
Why?

DOCTOR X453
So I mean, you're clearly heading in the right direction and I'm very encouraged by it.

PATIENT X453
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X453
Um you're last; we'll see what the A1c is today.

PATIENT X453
Right.

DOCTOR X453
Whenever we get your blood tests results and we'll talk about that.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
What's a good time to call you to make sure that you're home?

PATIENT X453

DOCTOR X453

PATIENT X453

PATIENT X453

PATIENT X453

DOCTOR X453

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
And then we'll go over them and then to see if we want to change any of your medications.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
Okay.  But you're doing all the right things.  You just have to follow up with the foot doctor to make sure, you know as a diabetes, you know you're prone to having more foot ulcerations and ulcerations can lead to really bad.

PATIENT X453
I've heard, that I had, when I bought these boots they were giving me a scab.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah.

PATIENT X453
But look at it, it healed.  It's healed.  I usually takes a while for it to heal and over this time right there.

DOCTOR X453
Exactly.

PATIENT X453
So I'm doing something right.

DOCTOR X453
Right.  And really high sugars will impair your wound healing basically and it sounds like you're @@@.

PATIENT X453
Yeah.

DOCTOR X453
@@@.

PATIENT X453
I got another question, well a couple of questions uh I got this cough.

DOCTOR X453
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X453
I don't know I keep coughing and coughing and coughing and I had it for about, going on a month.

DOCTOR X453
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X453
Sometimes it lasts for about three minutes, four minutes and then it'll go away and it's kind of bad when you're in class.

DOCTOR X453
Right.

PATIENT X453
Trying to listen to the teacher and you have this cough so I've been drinking water you know.

DOCTOR X453
Okay.

PATIENT X453
To sooth it or something like that.  I need something that's going to go on ahead and cut it out, am I sick, do I have a cold or what, what is it?

DOCTOR X453
Well we're gonna talk about that.  Um like how many times do you cough like that in a day?

PATIENT X453
A day?  About three or four times.

DOCTOR X453
Okay.  Uh when you cough to you bring anything up?

PATIENT X453
Yeah it's like uh, it's something I feel in my throat come up and then it's like a glob but it's clear.

DOCTOR X453

DOCTOR X453
Okay that's fine.  Um any fever or chills?

PATIENT X453

DOCTOR X453
Shortness of breath?

PATIENT X453

DOCTOR X453
Okay.

PATIENT X453
Only when I start coughing cause it makes me want to cough and cough and then my chest I got.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah.

PATIENT X453
It's all hurting in my chest but it's tight.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah.

PATIENT X453
And then after a while if I start coughing too much I could feel like uh muscles, you know they're tightening up.

DOCTOR X453
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X453
Yeah.

DOCTOR X453
From what you're telling me I'm not too concerned about it.  People do get the irritations in their throats and these.

PATIENT X453
Sometimes I get runny nose too.  It'll run, it's just like @@@.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah.  Viruses enhance, most of them are caused by viruses.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
There's no antibiotic or anything.

PATIENT X453
So I just got to let it run its course.

DOCTOR X453
I can give you some cough medication that maybe helps suppress the cough a little but you'll get better basically.

PATIENT X453
Um yeah well just give me that.

DOCTOR X453
Sure.

PATIENT X453

DOCTOR X453
Do you get a tickling sensation in your throat before you cough or?

PATIENT X453
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X453
So I'll give you some lozenges as well.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
And then um you can, like when you're in class you can.

PATIENT X453
Take them.

DOCTOR X453
Yeah, you can take them a little prophylactically.

PATIENT X453
Okay.

DOCTOR X453
So when you feel like it's a bad day or something like that.

PATIENT X453
I can feel it coming cause it starts tickling you know and I'm like trying to hold it, try not to cough.  So I buy a bottle and not a cold bottle of water just regular temperature.

DOCTOR X453
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X453
And I cleanse the throat and then I'll cough a little bit and it'll go away.  But it happens like twice, twice in a class period that I'm in.

DOCTOR X453

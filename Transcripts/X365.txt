DOCTOR X365
Patient?  Hi, how are you this morning?  How are you?

PATIENT X365
It's been really wild.

DOCTOR X365
Excuse me?  Hmm?
 
PATIENT X365
Bet you're my new doctor.

DOCTOR X365
Right here, okay.  

PATIENT X365
After you.

DOCTOR X365
I'll take it.  Yes I am DOCTOR.

PATIENT X365
I can't pronounce that.

DOCTOR X365
Alright, that's fine.  Oh bar, like a metal bar and then the watch around your wrist.

PATIENT X365
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah DOCTOR.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
Right in here.  Just sit, once I get @@@.

PATIENT X365
Hmm.

DOCTOR X365
Alright, falling asleep on me already?

PATIENT X365
Been a long day.

DOCTOR X365
Well I'll try to make this a little shorter.  Um PATIENT, what can we do for you today?

PATIENT X365
I'm just here to.

DOCTOR X365
Follow-up.

PATIENT X365
Yeah, well it's uh.

DOCTOR X365
Great I love follow-ups.

PATIENT X365
This is, I'm supposed to see you.  You're supposed to be my new uh.

DOCTOR X365
Sure.

PATIENT X365
My new uh general practitioner.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
Uh the other question is uh I don't understand why there wasn't a uh, a uh thing in for blood work.

DOCTOR X365
Today?

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Hmm.  Let's take a look shall we um.

PATIENT X365
And I spoke with the lady when I spoke to her a few weeks ago.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
She told me that uh I was given a new primary care doctor.

DOCTOR X365
Sure.

PATIENT X365
So I asked her first well okay, set up the date and I asked her do I have to you know, I'll come in and have the blood work done.  She says well nobody's put in anything for a blood work or anything.  I says well you know I don't know how long you've been doing this job but generally when they change from one doctor to another doctor.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
They do a blood work; this way here the incoming doctor knows what's going on because I think my last blood work was in January.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah I'm actually looking at it right now and to be honest with you there was nothing I noticed that I found to be too concerning.  So usually when that happens, when patients seem to be doing really well and we're not following up on anything acutely then once a year is fine.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
So, you know that's not a problem for me.  I mean was there anything that you were concerned about in particular?

PATIENT X365
No, the primarily uh the cholesterol count.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  So it.

PATIENT X365
That was the uh big thing.  Because I'm out of my cholesterol medication and.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
If I can get the, if I can get the.

DOCTOR X365
Absolutely.

PATIENT X365
The medication.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
That's fine and then in the next three months when I come in to see you or whatever.

DOCTOR X365
We'll get you back on the medication and we'll check the cholesterol.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
That's perfect.  Actually I refilled it so I think it'll be ready for you to pick up downstairs, let me just double check.  Do you, would you, lets try that again, alright.  Let's take a look at the details.  Um so I had put it to be mailed to you at home.

PATIENT X365
Right.

DOCTOR X365
The cholesterol medication is not urgent.  I don't want you to waste your time downstairs.

PATIENT X365
Now usually what I do.  Usually I order mine online.

DOCTOR X365
Oh really?

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Do you want me to cancel this or?

PATIENT X365
No, no, no, no, no.

DOCTOR X365
Okay keep it.

PATIENT X365
No let it go, this way I don't know how many other refills are behind this.

DOCTOR X365
Um let's see, what did I put it in for, so a 90 day supply with three refills.  That's the most they let me do, 270 days.

PATIENT X365
Okay, that's fine.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Because uh it's a half a tablet that I take.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
In the evening so.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
It's actually, that works out fine.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
That's fine.  That's, that was the biggest concern.  I don't have any aches or pains or anything.  Nothing to speak of, other than old age.  Uh I'll be back here the 6th of September.

DOCTOR X365
So you know actually looking at your cholesterol level that was taken in January, if you're doing everything the same and we get you back on the same medication um I don't think it'll be a problem.  Your last numbers were actually very good.

PATIENT X365
Yeah the medication that they put me on the simvastatin or whatever it is.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah simvastatin.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Did its job.

PATIENT X365
It's doing its job.  It's not like I go out and have steaks and everything every day or anything.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
But uh no, everything.

DOCTOR X365
Great.

PATIENT X365
As long as I don't have to, if I don't have to be here I don't want to be here.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah I mean we still recommend coming in once a year, even if you're completely healthy just so we can go over things like you're blood pressure's great, your temperature's fine, your heart rate is great.  The weight's a little high.

PATIENT X365
Yeah, that I, that I got to work on.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah so do you uh is there anything in particular you'd like me to talk about this visit?

PATIENT X365
Uh no sir.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
But if I have any questions in the near future.

DOCTOR X365
Oh absolutely.

PATIENT X365
I can probably reach you online.

DOCTOR X365
Online not too much.  Clinic would be the best and easiest way and then that way cause you know if we.  If you e-mail me and then I e-mail you back then there's this gap, there's this delay, I don't know.

PATIENT X365
Having to wait.

DOCTOR X365
Exactly.  This is what I want to show you.  This is the weight.  This is the trend that we have for the weight.  So today when you came in we had you at 270 and you know if I look at it, it really looks like since about well we'll say go ahead to 2006, the weight's steadily been going up.  Actually there was a three year gap right here so it's almost been pretty steady growth.  I mean do you have any ideas as to why that is?

PATIENT X365
No other than the fact that I smoke.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
I've been out of work for the last two years so I'm inactive.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
And uh, it's probably really what it is.

DOCTOR X365
So let's talk a little bit about that.  We'll kind of make that the issue for the day but since I have a bit of time you know they cause my next patient's scheduled at 11:15 so I have a half an hour.  Um let me just try to get a little bit of background history and update your chart, make sure that everything is okay.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
Um so in here, what I'm reading is that you know in the past, before we had the medication you had high cholesterol.  You also had a problem with arthritis in one of the knees.  

PATIENT X365
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Which knee was that, left, right or both?

PATIENT X365
Oh okay, it's more like when uh, the weather changes.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
You know it's an age thing.  I don't think it's uh, you know I don't think I hurt my legs or anything.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah and you know the thing is the osteoarthritis it gets worse with the weight going up.  It's just more wear and tear for your legs.  So if the weight, as it is right now, 270 pounds.  That's 70 pounds of weight gain you know since 2006 in the last six years.

PATIENT X365
That's a lot.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah that is a lot.  That's a lot of stress on your knees every day that they kind of have to deal with.  So if your knees are bothering you, yeah weather changes will make it worse but weight changes will make it worse for the rest of your life.  It's just more wear and tear.  So that's why I want to work on the weight.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
Um I'm also reading that you know there's been a history in the past with depression and post-traumatic stress is that right or you tell me.

PATIENT X365
Yes.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
As a matter of fact I'm going through uh 228.

DOCTOR X365
Okay and how do you feel that that's going?

PATIENT X365
Uh well I just started.  Just like uh.

DOCTOR X365
Just uh.

PATIENT X365
My third week.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  Is it helping?  Do you feel?

PATIENT X365
Uh.

DOCTOR X365
Like think they're moving in the right direction?

PATIENT X365
Well the first time I went into this thing it was a group thing.  Uh I don't like writing things down.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Okay I just don't like it.  I don't like the fact that they turn around and somebody says write it down so the more you, I don't have to write it down to remember it.  The incidents that happened in Vietnam, I don't like to write it down.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
It's there and it wakes me up in the middle of the night.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
Uh I get uh, I feel like I have restless leg syndrome.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
Uh doesn't matter what time of the year it is but I'll, I'll go for a walk, I'll go for a walk and I'm gone.  I'm gone for hour, hour and a half.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Uh in the session that I'm in right now it's like on a one to one basis and uh I feel like they're trying to pull me into saying something.  Uh last week they asked me says when you're calm you know 0-100 they have this scale, when you're calm you know how do you feel?  Where are you the most calm at?  I'm most calm at home, the porch, you know where there's no stress or anything.  Where I feel the most is in crowds.  I don't go to ballgames.  Uh I try to avoid large crowds.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Period.  If I walk into a building I don't care if I've been in this building 100 times.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
When I walk through that first door first thing I look for is an exit.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
I want to be able to get out if something happens.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
If I feel that my anxiety gets to high.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
I want to be able to get out.  I don't want to be, I don't want to be suppressed.  I don't want to you know be held someplace where I don't want to be.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
If I go to a picnic uh it's fine.  I'm outside because I have the freedom that if something doesn't feel right to me I can leave.

DOCTOR X365
Hmm.

PATIENT X365
Uh I distance myself from a lot of people that I used to know.  There are a lot of things that I used to do, that I enjoyed doing, I don't do anymore.  Uh I'm fine as long as my mind and hands are occupied.  I do little crafts around the house.  Sometimes I have the guy downstairs and he hands out those crafts and stuff, I'll pick up one of those things and it gives me something to do when I'm at the house.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Uh.

DOCTOR X365
You know before I forget to ask I did want to mention um I read that you were on the trazodone to help you go to sleep at night.

PATIENT X365
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X365
Has that been working for you?

PATIENT X365
Uh only as needed.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Only as needed.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
That's the whole thing.  I already take as needed.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
I don't like taking medications doc.  Uh I take my cholesterol medication because I know that I need it and I have to keep that in control but I do not want to become dependent on a sleep medication.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
So yes I have used it.  I don't fill it as often as I should.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
But if I feel that you know, I feel that I need it I take it.  I don't take it every day.

DOCTOR X365
Okay, no that's perfectly fine and since it's written as needed then that's okay.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
It's up to you to decide when you want to take it.  Um what I will say is that you know I understand your sentiment about not wanting to take medication.  The two medications we have you on right now, the statin and the aspirin that you take outside as well.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Right, those are good medications to be taking.  Um they're gonna do great things to protect your heart.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Protect you from having heart attacks and having strokes.  The only other problem is you know if the weight goes up.  I mean actually the weight level we're at right now, 270 pounds, is too high and it's gonna be the kind of thing where you're only 65 right now but if you'd stay at this weight in another five years, maybe even faster than that, you're gonna start to develop a lot of health problems which will require medications.  So if we work.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
On getting this weight under control now we can just keep you on the three medications you're on right now.

PATIENT X365
That'll work.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
There's uh.

DOCTOR X365
So uh.

PATIENT X365
The young lady uh the PET nurse.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
She gave me uh; she gave me my pneumonia vaccination.

DOCTOR X365
Perfect.

PATIENT X365
Uh she gave me this MOVE.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  Actually yeah that's what I was gonna talk about as well but since they talked to you about that already that.

PATIENT X365
That and uh the way to quit tobacco.  I got all the literature.  She did a good job of presenting her case and everything.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.  So of the two things having you quit tobacco is I think just as important as and you know the thing is.  Actually let me ask you, you're smoking ten cigarettes a day still or?

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  So what I want you to do is try to cut down on that.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
I think that your goal should be at five cigarettes a day.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
And I think you should get there and stay there in the next two months.  Do you think you can do that?  Or what do you think would be more reasonable?

PATIENT X365
That's an attainable goal.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Yeah I can do that.  I can do that.

DOCTOR X365
If you can quit, I mean, don't stop at five if you feel like you can go any further.

PATIENT X365
Well you know it's kind of funny.  Uh when my son was born.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
And my son's in his 30s right now.  When my son was born I quit smoking and then uh when he was about 12 or 13, he was in an accident and I snapped.

DOCTOR X365
Hmm.

PATIENT X365
Because you should, the accident shouldn't have happened so on the way driving from xxx to Atlanta I picked up a pack of cigarettes and I just started smoking again.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
I think it was more a lack of worry.

DOCTOR X365
Stress can definitely do it.

PATIENT X365
And I think that's what did most of it.

DOCTOR X365
The thing is we have to find better ways of dealing with the stress and actually you know the Mental Health people are gonna be the ones that can really help you with that.  I understand that some of the you know activities that they have you do aren't ones that you're necessarily a fan of like writing things down.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
But talk to them and see if there's any other alternatives.

PATIENT X365
Well I'm on the one to one basis right now.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
And uh right now they're recording my sessions and I sit there and we talk but it's not talk as in like we're doing now okay.  She's going down this book.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
You know, talks about this, talks about this, talk about this uh.  Where is your stress level?  What is the medium stress?  I don't know what a medium stress level is.  I couldn't, I know what my high stress level is and I know how calm I am.  I have no clue what a middle is.  I have no clue what a middle is.  I tend to leave areas when I feel uncomfortable.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  There's um, there's also do you remember DOCTOR?  DOCTOR or DOCTOR, he was a clinical psychologist.

PATIENT X365
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X365
That saw you back in May.  Are you still in contact with him?

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
He's the one that got me into this One on One Program.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  But you still follow-up with him personally?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
No.

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
I, right now, when I talk to somebody else over there it's a NAME.

DOCTOR X365
At Mental Health?

PATIENT X365
Yeah.  She's the one that prescribed the trazodone.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
And we'll sit down and we'll talk you know.  It's easier to talk when you're not reading it out of a book.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
You know what I'm saying?

DOCTOR X365
No I agree with you.

PATIENT X365
You know it's like, it's like somebody's looking at you and they're reading a instruction manual.

DOCTOR X365
Right.

PATIENT X365
On how to deal with you.  It's fine but, kind of gives you that uneasy feeling there for a while.  You know they have a good system and everything, I just feel that it's too book, too much book.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
But you know, that's just my opinion.

DOCTOR X365
Alright, well.  Here's kind of what I want to focus on.  Um I should first, let me ask you in terms of your overall mood uh do you feel like you're currently depressed or too anxious?

PATIENT X365
I'm not depressed.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Uh I'm always anxious even, I'm always anxious.  Uh somebody turns around and tells me well we're gonna leave at 3:30, quarter to 3 I'm ready to go.  I'll sit and wait for the 45 minutes.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Okay.  3:30 you ain't ready I'm gone.  Don't tell me we're gonna do something at a certain time and then, I understand things happen but you have so much time to get from point A to point B and you want to be there at a certain time, let's get on the, let's go.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  So let me just fill, these are some of the things that the VA wants me to talk to you about.

PATIENT X365
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X365
One of them is the smoking which we've already kind of done.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
We've come up with a plan and I think it's reasonable and you told me that it's reasonable.

PATIENT X365
Yeah, it's attainable.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah five cigarettes and the way, the easiest way to do it is just you know realize that at the end of this week um smoking one less cigarette a day.  So all you do to stop smoking five, so this week ten, next week nine then eight, then seven, then six, then five.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  

PATIENT X365
In other words if I eliminate one cigarette this week.

DOCTOR X365
One cigarette a day.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
For the week.

PATIENT X365
Alright.

DOCTOR X365
Um so that's, we're gonna taper you down and you are willing to quit is that right?

PATIENT X365
Sure.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
The last time I was in here I talked to the doctor and he told me he says well we have programs here to help you.

DOCTOR X365
Can I see, which exactly which one she gave you?

PATIENT X365
Right uh.

DOCTOR X365
Somewhere in here?

PATIENT X365
All three of them and the pneumonia shot, the other one is.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Yeah you know I'm gonna have to say and anyway he turned around and he told me he says well we have programs here to help you quit.  I said okay fine.   He says how about if we put you in for the, what do you call it the patch.  I was okay fine you know.  Never heard anything else about it.

DOCTOR X365
Here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna place a consult to the Stop Smoking Clinic.

PATIENT X365
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X365
And usually what they do is that they'll try to get a hold of you and figure out when would be a good time scheduling wise.  Um the other thing is there is a program here.  I wonder if this is the same one, I can check out the numbers.

PATIENT X365
Oh it's the.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah the 1-800 QUIT NOW okay.  So look into this program.  I mean take a look at this brochure and then call the number and ask them and tell them you're ready.

PATIENT X365
Yes uh the lady told me that there was uh, I can go to this thing here and take a little survey thing online.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Okay.  Okay, we got a plan.

DOCTOR X365
The other thing that we have to do, let's see, let me put this in.  So one of the things that can happen, one second so uh.  You know this is very frustrating for me.  Now we have to do this on the computer while we, while we have the encounter.  In the old days I could write and talk at the same time.  I can't do the same because there's all this looking and everything that goes into it.  So it's just my thing to deal with.  The other thing that's important to talk about is someone your age with a history of smoking cause one of the things smoking does is it damages the blood vessels and there's actually a very important and very big blood vessel that runs through your entire body basically from here to here.  It's called your aorta.

PATIENT X365
Hmm.

DOCTOR X365
And it's sort of like in the back right by the spinal column and what can happen is over time smoking can damage it and make it sort of swell up and once it's swelled it actually becomes weaker cause the walls kind of stretch and what we worry about is in people that have these large aortas is that they can sort of burst and it's a very, very serious medical condition.  Actually roughly 50% of the people that have that happen to them will never even make it into the hospital.  I mean that's it for them.

PATIENT X365
It's a major blood vessel.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah it is the major blood vessel.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
So what we recommend is once you get to around the age of 65, which you know you're at right now, we screen you for it and it's a one-time thing.  Basically what we do is we do an ultrasound and take a look see how big it is.  If it's bigger than normal and normal is about 2 cm or about 1 inch, 1 1/2 inches and it can get all the way up to 2 1/2 inches and if it's big then we need to follow it closely and make sure it's not getting bigger too quickly.  And if it reaches a certain size then we can do a surgery before you know.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
It ruptures and the outcome is way better if that's the case.  So what I would like to do, with your permission, is just schedule you for an ultrasound.

PATIENT X365
Sure.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  So we'll go ahead and.

PATIENT X365
Schedule me for a brain transplant if you need.

DOCTOR X365
Well you gotta wait your turn I might need one of those too.  So let's see we have the ultrasound and that's fine.  Okay great, finish.

PATIENT X365
Alright doc but I'll be here; I'll be back in the hospital here September 6th.  I'll be here September 6th at the Eye Clinic downstairs, September 6th.

DOCTOR X365
Let's go ahead and put that in for that.  Uh is that in the morning, the Eye Clinic?

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  So I'll put the order in for 5 a.m. but they really should be able to do it anytime so just go down to Radiology and on that day just ask them, let them know that and I need an ultrasound where do I go for that and they'll point you in the right direction.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
I can tell you know I mean you know September 6th.

PATIENT X365
Well Radiology is on the first floor right by the Lab.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.  So I mean that's uh, that's it for me.  You know what I'll also do; I'll repeat the lipid panel on September 6th, that sound okay?

PATIENT X365
Lipid panel?

DOCTOR X365
Oh to check for the cholesterol and everything.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
Actually, no once a year is fine.  You did have it in January.

PATIENT X365
Hmm.

DOCTOR X365
So we don't need to do it any time faster than that.

PATIENT X365
We can do it in uh.

DOCTOR X365
It was actually right at the beginning of the year so we can do it after the winter holidays.

PATIENT X365
That'll work.

DOCTOR X365
Okay so that.

PATIENT X365
I mean the only other time I'll have to draw blood is if I come in here for something else.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.  So I mean it's not a problem. 

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Right now everything's good.  Uh just a few quick questions from me.  Are you having any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X365
Uh no.

DOCTOR X365
Any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
Any trouble breathing?

PATIENT X365
Uh no.

DOCTOR X365
Any shortness of breath or cough?

PATIENT X365
I have a cough.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
But I think it's related to smoking.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.  Has that cough been the same for the last couple years?

PATIENT X365
It's been the same for the last uh.

DOCTOR X365
Couple decades?

PATIENT X365
Cute no uh actually it's only; it's gotten worse in the last three months.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
The last three months it's really gotten worse but you know like I say I think I attribute most of it now, being as though we're having this conversation about smoking regarding to that.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
So uh.

DOCTOR X365
Any crushing chest pain or pressure, chest pressure where you feel like you can't breathe?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
But uh on occasion, it'll start hurting behind here in my left arm.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  What kind of pain is that?

PATIENT X365
Uh like a dull numbing pain.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
Not sharp or anything.  It's just more; it's more like you know when your hand falls asleep.

DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
And you try to get it back up to get that.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
It's just that numb feeling and it just, it's just annoying sometimes.  Then other times my hands will.

DOCTOR X365
How often does that happen, that numb feeling?  Uh would you say once a week, once a month, once a day?

PATIENT X365
Uh it was uh, if I had to put an average on it.

DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
I'd say every two weeks.

DOCTOR X365
And are you doing anything that makes that happen?

PATIENT X365
Not unless I'm sleeping wrong but I doubt that uh.

DOCTOR X365
For example uh how far can you walk before you get tired or out of breath?

PATIENT X365
Oh I can walk for an hour.

DOCTOR X365
Okay and does that cause the arm pain?

PATIENT X365
No.  No.

DOCTOR X365
Okay can you climb uh, how many flights of stairs can you climb?

PATIENT X365
I climb a flight of stairs every day.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  Any pain in the arm when that happens?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  

PATIENT X365
Uh I ride my motorcycle and I don't even know if the sun's shining or not.  Uh here lately I've become uh a bit @@@.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.  So actually PATIENT what I want to do is since you're here I just want to look you over.  Listen to your heart, your lungs; take a look at your stomach.  Uh just go ahead and have a seat up there and we'll lay you flat.  Actually I'll go ahead and listen from the back and then I'll have you lie flat.  But it doesn't sound like it's a heart pain to me.  Now the problem, the thing I get worried about is if it's every time you walk, every time you exerted yourself, every time you climb stairs you are having chest pain, shortness of breath, you felt sweaty, nauseous.

PATIENT X365
No uh those are heart attack symptoms.

DOCTOR X365
Exactly.  So this I think is musculoskeletal.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
And I think it's just you know from using the arm.  Let me go ahead and take a listen.  Uh do me a favor, nice deep breaths with your mouth open.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
So just go in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, one more great.  Alright the lungs sound clear.  Go ahead and take a listen.  You can breathe normally again.  Actually let's have you lie down, it might help you feel a little bit better.  Let's take a look at the stomach.  Any pain when I push?

PATIENT X365
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X365
When I push?

PATIENT X365
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X365
When I push?

PATIENT X365
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X365
No, how about here?

PATIENT X365
Now that's a little tender.

DOCTOR X365
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X365
For years.

DOCTOR X365
For years.  Any problems with bowel movements?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
Any blood in the stools?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
Dark stool?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
Diarrhea or constipation?

PATIENT X365
No.

DOCTOR X365
No.  That's fine, sit up.  How often do you have a bowel movement?

PATIENT X365
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X365
Twice a day.

PATIENT X365
I have one in the morning and then I have one uh later on that day.

DOCTOR X365
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT X365
No.  Usually on occasion I try, if I have a fever or a chill, it's uh.

DOCTOR X365
Alright you can have a seat back on the chair.

PATIENT X365
Usually it's from uh being caught in the rain or whatever.  The thing is if I feel sick I don't go by my great grandson.

DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
I don't need them to get sick when grandpa's not feeling well.

DOCTOR X365
Alright so that's the plan alright.  Ultrasound when you come back in.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Uh also we'll get, wow there's no other labs actually we've decided no labs for now.  So we'll repeat the lipid panel in one year.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

DOCTOR X365
Alright and that's it.  Following Mental Health and then the smoking.

PATIENT X365
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X365
Alright.  So let me go uh talk to DOCTOR, who is my supervising physician.  I'll tell her everything that you've told me.  She'll come in and ask just a few questions, they'll more or less be the same but see if she has any different recommendations alright.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

DOCTOR X365
So I'll be back in just, probably about a minute.

PATIENT X365
Alright thank you.

DOCTOR X365
But if it's not a minute don't get upset.

PATIENT X365
Yeah I get antsy.

DOCTOR X365
Alright.

DOCTOR OUT:  139:5  DOCTOR IN:  145:40

FIRST DOCTOR X365

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
I'm not trying to hide it you know, yes I do, I do smoke.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Right.

PATIENT X365
But I could like some other people do and spray the Binaca and stuff.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah, yeah.  I know you're working on it so.

PATIENT X365
Yeah uh we uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
We set a goal for right now.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Okay.  Good, good, good.  Alright.  So everything is good except that you just need to get some blood tests and to check your vitamin D.  You know at some point it was low.  I want to make sure that it’s okay.

PATIENT X365
Well they can take the blood on the way out.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah, yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Oh perfect.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
So let's do that.

PATIENT X365
I can get it done on the way out.  That's what I was telling you earlier.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X365
Uh you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah, yeah cause that.

PATIENT X365
This way I get it.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Right.  So let's do that and then we are also checking HIV on all.

PATIENT X365
I don't have that.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
The patients.

PATIENT X365
I know that I don't have that.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Regardless.  Okay the risk factors.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Um.  When was the last time you were checked?

PATIENT X365
Every time they the blood, the last time they drew blood.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
We don't do HIV when we draw the blood.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Yeah we usually need your permission to screen for it specifically so it's not in the included blood tests.  If you want we can go ahead and screen you and sort of.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Why, you'll take that outside with you.

PATIENT X365
I'm going right down to have blood taken and you might as well have everything done right now.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
So that's what I'll do that, yeah and then um then just one more thing.  You need a booster shot for whooping cough um.  It's coming back up again so we are giving booster shots for all the vets.

PATIENT X365
I got the pneumonia today.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yes today and its okay.

PATIENT X365
I got the pneumonia today.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Exactly.  This is a shot as well.  Is that okay with you?

PATIENT X365
You mean to take them both at the same time?

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yes.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Alright.  We'll let the nurse know that.

PATIENT X365

SECOND DOCTOR X365

PATIENT X365

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah maintenance, total maintenance.

PATIENT X365
Right, you know it's like, I know we were talking about this earlier.  I couldn't understand why they didn't want to you know didn't put an order in for drawing blood when I came earlier before the uh.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
Visit.  That's fine.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
I told him, I said that's fine I can do it on the way out.

SECOND DOCTOR X365

PATIENT X365
And this way here you guys can.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
Analyze it, boil it.

SECOND DOCTOR X365

PATIENT X365
Feed it to vampires, whatever you needed to do.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
Alright that sounds good.

PATIENT X365
Okay thank you very much.

SECOND DOCTOR X365
We'll let you know if anything comes back abnormal okay.

PATIENT X365
Okay, yeah well that's okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Alright so you know that's what we'll do.  We'll get you that shot because you mentioned you were around your grandson so I told DOCTOR and she said you know once you get 65 and you're right there, so we figured.

PATIENT X365
Oh how do I get that?

FIRST DOCTOR X365
@@@ out a little bit.

PATIENT X365
Yeah I already got the pneumonia.  It's not, it's no uh.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Link between the two.

PATIENT X365
There's no interaction of these?

FIRST DOCTOR X365
No, no.

PATIENT X365
Two uh shots.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
No the pneumonia you get more often.  But this is just a booster just because by the time you get.

PATIENT X365
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Yeah.

PATIENT X365
So the most @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Let me just make.

PATIENT X365
This is something.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Okay.  Yeah Pneumococcal vaccine yep.

PATIENT X365
Now there's not gonna be any drug interaction between this and the other, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
There will not be.

PATIENT X365
Alright.  I just want to make sure I'm not uh driving down the street and I start hallucinating.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
So here's what I'm gonna do, since we're gonna do that vitamin D level, actually DOCTOR was very thorough.  She went back to 2009.

PATIENT X365
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
And it looks like it was low then so we can't really do anything based off that value in 2009 cause it's 2012 now.

PATIENT X365
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
So let's see how it is in the meantime.  Maybe it's improved.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Maybe it hasn't um but since I'm doing that and we're doing the HIV screening, we're sticking you anyway uh I'm gonna go ahead and bump those, some of the other tests that we talked about up just normal routine stuff.

PATIENT X365
Yeah the.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
That we went over.

PATIENT X365
The cholesterol and everything.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
The cholesterol, did you eat this morning?

PATIENT X365
No.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
No.  You haven't eaten anything since yesterday for dinner?

PATIENT X365
That's right.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
No coffee, no juice, nothing.  Oh mind if I add that on?

PATIENT X365
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
So we'll get the full panel you know.

PATIENT X365
Yeah, so when I stopped in at the Lab this morning the girl asked and says did you eat anything I said yeah I had steak and eggs uh.  She says no I got.  I says no I haven't had anything since yesterday.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Okay.

PATIENT X365
So that's why I stopped at the Lab thing to have the blood drawn but there was no order in.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
So let's see where is my @@@.  You know what, I'll actually I won't look for it right now.  I'll talk to the nurse and let her know.  You hear that too right.  So we'll do that and we'll get you out of here.  Alright so there we go.  We talked about this, this, this and this alright and you did agree to get screened so I put the order in already.

PATIENT X365
And the cholesterol medication will be sent in the mail to me.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Yep just like we talked about.

PATIENT X365
That'll work.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Alright so here we go and this is it.  Alright and lets sign all this fun stuff and get you going.  Oh this is signed.  Go ahead and find the nurse and let her know and then six months should be fine, sooner if there are any problems.

PATIENT X365
Yeah.  That's what usually happens you know.  Unless I don't have to be here, I come in here for other things. 

FIRST DOCTOR X365
And you know what's gonna keep you out is working on smoking and the weight.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
I mean if you can get those two under control by yourself then you might just have to deal with me once a year.

PATIENT X365
I can deal with that, that's probably ideal.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Alright so, take this to the clerk.  Actually, uh just @@@ let her know you need your shot.

PATIENT X365
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X365
Sorry you have to meet with them but don't leave quite yet.

PATIENT X365
I won't.

Time is 11:30.

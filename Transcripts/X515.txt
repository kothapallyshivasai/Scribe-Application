DOCTOR X515

PATIENT X515
Alright. 

DOCTOR X515
Good.  Saw the eye doc today?

PATIENT X515
Yeah.

DOCTOR X515
Okay good.

PATIENT X515
Yeah.

DOCTOR X515
They got a follow-up scheduled for you?

PATIENT X515
Yes, @@@.  Did you get the results from the MRI?

DOCTOR X515
Uh yeah let me look at it again.

PATIENT X515
Cause to be honest with you after I had the MRI.

SECOND PERSON 
He had the MRI last week so.  

PATIENT X515
I can't, I don't know what it was.

SECOND PERSON X515
Some @@@.

DOCTOR X515
You've had those problems for a long time right?

PATIENT X515
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah.

PATIENT X515
93.

DOCTOR X515
Okay.

PATIENT X515
For 4 1/2 months we all were wrong.

DOCTOR X515
Uh-huh.  You had surgery on your neck before?

PATIENT X515
I've had surgery on my neck and then I had another surgery towards the bottom of my back.  So I had two laminectomies.

DOCTOR X515
Your medicine.  Do you have any low blood sugars?

PATIENT X515
What does that mean?

DOCTOR X515
Low blood sugars, like is your blood sugar ever low?

PATIENT X515
No I don't think, now I do have diabetes type 2.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah right.

PATIENT X515
Okay.

DOCTOR X515
Uh the other thing, so in regards to the neck I mean I don't, this is going to be a chronic problem I don't know, I don't think.

PATIENT X515
Alright they told, that's really highest dose @@@.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah so I think we can, I'll put in a referral for Physical Medicine to see you.

PATIENT X515
I don't think that'd be a good idea.

DOCTOR X515
Well we could do that in the future.

PATIENT X515
@@@.

DOCTOR X515
Same thing, there's not I just want to make sure that the chronic changes.

PATIENT X515
I'll buy that.  Well I.  Really the two times, I had the lower back surgery in 2001.  I had two herniated disks and you know the surgeon went in there and of course he done it because the vertebrae would be swollen.  He went in there to relieve that off my spinal cord but he also tried to get the vertebrae to pop out and they didn’t.

DOCTOR X515
And they didn't yeah.

PATIENT X515
Uh there's a prescription I've run out.  I think first of all we may have an automated prescription system here.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah but you have to call and get your refills.

PATIENT X515
I know.

DOCTOR X515
Okay but yeah, yeah they do.

PATIENT X515
Well because they kept hanging up on me.

DOCTOR X515
Oh.

PATIENT X515
I don't know and I was under the impression that the one, this one, the bottle well it said one, one with no refill.

DOCTOR X515
Let me take a listen.  Deep breath.  Let me listen to your heart.  Take your shoes and socks off, I want to have a look at your legs this time.

PATIENT X515
Okay.  I know, believe me, I watch that very closely.

DOCTOR X515
Okay, um the other thing have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X515
I don't want one.

DOCTOR X515
Oh I could give you some cards to check your stool at home.

PATIENT X515
@@@ the nurse offered me that kit.  Okay I'll just tell you doc @@@ all over the place @@@.

DOCTOR X515
Um.

PATIENT X515
@@@ if I got it cause the way I'm living, @@@.  And as far as my prescription if you order them again or whatever, can you just order me one month at a time?  The reason I ask this is cause I get so many of them, I can’t afford to pay that bill.

DOCTOR X515
Okay.

PATIENT X515
But you, can I call the prescription number in and see cause they @@@.

DOCTOR X515
I'll put that in for you and I'll change these other ones to one month.

PATIENT X515
Oh I appreciate that doc.  And I did @@@ but the reason I come to the VA cause I ran out of money.

DOCTOR X515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X515
Like I said I've been fighting this for 17 years.

DOCTOR X515
And the other thing, your cholesterol was on the high side.

PATIENT X515
Yes, not good.

DOCTOR X515
I need to add, we would like to add the medication, the simvastatin.

PATIENT X515
Right.  Uh I take this; doctors from the Outpatient Clinic gave me.

DOCTOR X515
The aspirin I have it in here.

PATIENT X515
Yes.

DOCTOR X515
But you can buy that over-the-counter.

PATIENT X515
Right, right, okay yeah, don’t worry about that.  Alright now he took me off of the, uh DOCTOR took me off of this cholesterol medicine.

DOCTOR X515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X515
Cause he thought it might be suppressing my @@@ that's what it was.

DOCTOR X515
No it shouldn't.  Let me, you want to restart it?

PATIENT X515
Yeah, right yeah.

DOCTOR X515
I'm going to put you on 40 mg.  So the big side effects with this is that some people have severe muscle pains. 

PATIENT X515
Right.

DOCTOR X515
That's very rare but that's the most common side effect um.  It can be a muscle pain, mostly in the big muscles.

PATIENT X515
Oh, how's that.

DOCTOR X515
The back um you know then stop it and if it's really severe come in right away.

PATIENT X515
He @@@ the pain was so bad I couldn't walk.  He took me off and said to get @@@ I don't know.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah I mean if you are noticing @@@.

PATIENT X515
But @@@ yes I will.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah.  And uh I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X515
Sure.  Uh before I your way out, do you know about the, I need dentures.

DOCTOR X515
Okay there's, the dental is really limited here at the VA.  We don't, I know they don't supply dentures.  The only dental clinic.

PATIENT X515
Now they used to.

DOCTOR X515
They used to um.

PATIENT X515
They gave me dentures in 1984 in fact, my teeth, the reason I got dentures is because of the service.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah.  They, you can try the Walk-In Dental Clinic and see what they say but I know it's much harder now to get dentures than it used to be in the past.  Um.

PATIENT X515
Where's that at?

DOCTOR X515
Yeah there's a Walk-In Dental Clinic um.

PATIENT X515
@@@.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah I'll ask, I'll ask where it is.  I'm not sure where it is but I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  40:34  DOCTOR IN:  45:03)

DOCTOR X515
So the one thing I did think about for your back, we have a Pain Clinic.

PATIENT X515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X515
What they can do, I don't know if you've ever had like an epidural injection or it's not exactly an epidural but it's like an injection near your spine.  It can sometimes help with the symptoms um.

PATIENT X515
That's okay.

DOCTOR X515
The other thing they have, one of the physicians there does some manipulations.

PATIENT X515
@@@ going to a chiropractor.

DOCTOR X515
Kind of.

PATIENT X515
I've wondered about that.

DOCTOR X515
Um he's not a chiropractor but it's um, it's similar.

PATIENT X515
Well you saw the results of that MRI. Is my spine out of whack?  @@@.

DOCTOR X515
Yeah it has those chronic changes which probably aren't going to go away but if you get involved with the Pain Clinic and they give you some injections and maybe some manipulations.

PATIENT X515
Alright.

DOCTOR X515
That might help.

PATIENT X515
Yes.

DOCTOR X515
Do you want that?

PATIENT X515
Cause I mean I've had @@@.

DOCTOR X515
It might help yeah.  Cause the Pain Clinic might help.

PATIENT X515
And that aspirin.  I just buy baby aspirin right?

DOCTOR X515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X515
Yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X515
Alright so, you're all set.  You go to the Pharmacy um, Pharmacy to pick up the pain medications.  How many of those Vicodin do you take a day?

PATIENT X515
Well, I've been following; I know it's one every six hours.

DOCTOR X515
Okay.  So you're normally taking four a day?

PATIENT X515
Uh you sometimes I was trying that @@@.  I was trying to stay away from it but at times I was, I was higher than a kite.

DOCTOR X515
Okay so you probably take closer to two or three pills a day?

PATIENT X515
Yeah two or three.

DOCTOR X515
Okay.

PATIENT X515
And then I can @@@.

DOCTOR X515
Okay.

PATIENT X515
I mean my eyes were so glassy @@@ they are gonna be arresting me and yeah that's another thing, my balance is terrible.  Is that primarily because of the spine thing too?

DOCTOR X515
Yeah.  Alright so you're all set.  The Pain Clinic will contact you.

PATIENT X515
Alright.

DOCTOR X515
Okay.

PATIENT X515
Now I got a prescription with the Pharmacy.

DOCTOR X515
You got prescriptions at the Pharmacy, for the Pain Management and your cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT X515
Alright.

DOCTOR X515
And I changed all your other medicines too.

PATIENT X515
Back to 30 days.

DOCTOR X515
To 30 days so they might try and give you another 30 days supply but you can.

PATIENT X515
If I want @@@.

DOCTOR X515
Tell them you only need the cholesterol and the Vicodin today okay.

PATIENT X515
Right.  Can you give me an idea where the Pharmacy is?

DOCTOR X515

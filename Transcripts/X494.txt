DOCTOR X494
Are you having bowel movements?

PATIENT X494

DOCTOR X494
That works better for you?

Yeah that works.

DOCTOR X494
So we'll switch you back to that okay.

PATIENT X494

DOCTOR X494
Oh they sent that automatically?

PATIENT X494
Yeah.  They sent me two of them.

DOCTOR X494

DOCTOR X494
What have your sugars been running in the morning?

Well this morning they was kind of high, 127.

DOCTOR X494
Okay.  Not too bad.

PATIENT X494
No but I usually be in the 90s or the low hundreds you now.

DOCTOR X494

PATIENT X494
It depends on what I eat you know at night.  If I leave that refrigerator closed after 9 o'clock I'd be alright but I can't do it.

DOCTOR X494
Yeah.  Me too.

PATIENT X494
You know I don't, I don't say I'm a smoker but last night, I don't know why you interested in the pools or not.

DOCTOR X494
So if they lose they're out, if they win they're in?

PATIENT X494
No @@@ do.

DOCTOR X494
Okay.

PATIENT X494
I wonder why they taking me off of these little pills and wanted me to use this liquid stuff.

DOCTOR X494
I was thinking a liquid might work better but I'll switch you back to those pills.  You're taking an aspirin every day right?

PATIENT X494
Yeah.

DOCTOR X494
Okay.  And you're taking the medicine for your cholesterol?

PATIENT X494
Yeah.

DOCTOR X494
Alright very good.

PATIENT X494
Take a half a tab.

DOCTOR X494
Okay and you're not having any worsening chest pain or anything like that are you?

PATIENT X494
Nothing but my stomach was killing me when you know if I don't have that uh @@@ at the bottom of my stomach.

DOCTOR X494
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X494
But after that fifth day I said no I went and got me some of them little old pills.

DOCTOR X494
You want me to put some in?

PATIENT X494
Yeah, yeah put them in and that's all I want.  Don't put nothing else in there.

DOCTOR X494
Okay.

PATIENT X494
Cause I had to take it as big as they come.

DOCTOR X494
Yeah I put um 90 day supply with three refills and you can take one or two tablets.

PATIENT X494
Huh?

DOCTOR X494
It comes, the prescription will say take two tablets as needed and they'll come with you know 180 but you can take one or two as needed.

PATIENT X494
In other words, you get 180 in the box?

DOCTOR X494
Correct.

PATIENT X494
Yeah that's good.  I usually take two about 9 o'clock at night, the next morning really.

DOCTOR X494
You're due to see the eye doctor too.

PATIENT X494
When?

DOCTOR X494
In May.

PATIENT X494
This May.

DOCTOR X494
Yeah.

PATIENT X494
Okay I better go up there and get a date then.  That's the only one?

DOCTOR X494
Yeah that's the next one.

PATIENT X494
In May.

DOCTOR X494
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X494
Do it said a date?

DOCTOR X494
Just any time in May.  Any time it works for you.  You can set it up today I think.

PATIENT X494
Yeah I'll go up there, but that still on the, no that's on the fifth floor ain't it.

DOCTOR X494
I'm not exactly sure.

PATIENT X494
Yeah I think it is.  It's about time for me to get a foot doctor, see the foot doctor too.

DOCTOR X494
You saw him in February and.

PATIENT X494
I saw the foot doctor in February?

DOCTOR X494
You actually saw, who did you see, you saw a nurse at the Foot Clinic.

PATIENT X494
Yeah that's uh.

DOCTOR X494
You saw the foot doctor in November.  Yeah they wanted you to come back as well so we can schedule that too.

PATIENT X494
Foot doctor okay, that's on the 7th so.

DOCTOR X494
Uh-huh.  Now in 2004, you had a colonoscopy um let's see.  You haven't noticed any blood in your stool or black tarry stool or weight loss or anything like that?

PATIENT X494
The only time I see blood in the stool is when I'm going to pass and it's too hard my hemorrhoids.

SECOND PERSON X494
@@@.

PATIENT X494
You know the hemorrhoids but after that.

DOCTOR X494
Cause what I'm trying to figure out if you've had your colonoscopy in 2004 uh about six years ago showed a couple polyps and they were removed and they were the least dangerous kind of polyps but at that time your, the doctors thought you might, the colonoscopy doctor thought you might need to get a repeat colonoscopy yet last year or this year you know depending on how your overall health is.  I think your overall health is pretty good um.  You've got some heart disease but um you know you're lungs are okay.  I think you should, would be able to tolerate a colonoscopy um, if that's something you wished to pursue.

PATIENT X494
No, no.

DOCTOR X494
No okay.

PATIENT X494
That's the thing they go up your rectum.

DOCTOR X494
Yeah.

PATIENT X494
No I don't want to go through that no more.

DOCTOR X494
Okay.  I think that's reasonable.  I mean you're 84, you're pretty healthy.  The benefits would be catching a cancer early um.  Do you notice any unexplained weight loss, fevers, chill, you know, sweats, weight loss anything like that or if you notice?

PATIENT X494
Sweats.

DOCTOR X494
Your stool changing.  Huh.

PATIENT X494
I sweat all the time.

DOCTOR X494
Like unexplained sweats or weight loss.

PATIENT X494
No.

DOCTOR X494
Okay uh, so you're weight's been pretty stable.  So or if you notice tarry stool and it would be black like the color of this um.  Let me take a look and see.  Deep breath and I'll listen to your heart.  Would you be willing to get some blood work done today, checking your A1c, your diabetes?

PATIENT X494
Huh?

DOCTOR X494
Would you be willing to check some blood today?

PATIENT X494
It don't matter.

DOCTOR X494
Okay, alright.  I think we should check that um, let me talk with DOCTOR and you'll be all set okay.

PATIENT X494
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  25:18  DOCTOR IN:  28:21)

DOCTOR X494
Alright, you're all set um give this to them up front and we're just gonna check that diabetes lab.  We'll get you to the eye doctors and foot doctors.  

PATIENT X494
Oh you want me to take it today?

DOCTOR X494
Yeah I'd get it checked today while you're here.

PATIENT X494
Okay uh now you don't, the pharmacist got this?

DOCTOR X494
Yeah I put that in, see its right here.

PATIENT X494
Okay cause I don't want to go down there and be sitting out there waiting.

DOCTOR X494

PATIENT X494
Yeah.

DOCTOR X494

PATIENT X494

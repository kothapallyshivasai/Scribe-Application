DOCTOR X303
PATIENT?  You're here. 

PATIENT X303
Here.

DOCTOR X303
Oh, there you are, sorry about that.  I wasn't looking at this chair.  How you guys doing?

PATIENT X303
Alright.

DOCTOR X303
Come on back.  Come on in, alright.  Good to see you again.  It's been a few months.

PATIENT X303
Yes it has.  I don't like this system.  I used to make appointments, now they you get on at six months.

DOCTOR X303
I know.

PATIENT X303
Anyway, I was just looking this list over.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
And this one is missing, the vitamin D.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
And I'm out of them.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Oh.

PATIENT X303
I have the one I take for the 15th but that emptied it and I called them in and they tell me they're gonna get to you and get permission and call them back in a week but.

DOCTOR X303
Well you know why because we only do that high dose monthly vitamin D for three months but then it's supposed to go to weekly.  Let me just see what we need.

SECOND PERSON X303
Really.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah, if somebody is very deficient in vitamin D, we put them on a high dose pill once a month for a few months, no you know what we do, we do it once a week for a few weeks and then we'll go to once a month.

PATIENT X303
I was once a month always.

DOCTOR X303
You never were on once a week.

SECOND PERSON X303
No.

DOCTOR X303
Oh, let's just see what we had.  Did I prescribe this for you or did you get it from one of the other doctors, do you remember?

SECOND PERSON X303
Oh I wonder if DOCTOR.

PATIENT X303
No uh uh, it was a doctor here.  I don't know.

DOCTOR X303
Not the kidney?

PATIENT X303
I've had so many.

DOCTOR X303
Kidney folks?

PATIENT X303
Could have been DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X303
Oh yeah could have been DOCTOR.

PATIENT X303
Probably DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON X303
@@@.

PATIENT X303
Or what's that gal's name that was the pharmacist?

SECOND PERSON X303
I don't know.

DOCTOR X303
You know it looks like your levels are actually and you just had them done and they look normal.  Let me just.

SECOND PERSON X303
Oh good.

DOCTOR X303
It looks like they've come back up.  So we may be able to put you on a lower daily dose rather than worry about this high dose stuff.  Let me see here.  Yeah I think we could probably move to a daily.  How long have you been taking that monthly vitamin D?  Has it been a long time?

PATIENT X303
Oh I would say at least a year.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Just that one tablet a month?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
Well I mean if it's working.

SECOND PERSON X303
Alright, okay.  It was added uh in December of 2010 and it was DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X303
Oh so it was uh, okay so we'll just keep going with it then.  I don't want to change the uh you know.  You want to just here; do you want it in the mail?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
I still, I just took the one, the 15th I took one and so I got a month to get it.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X303
There's no overdose problems?

DOCTOR X303
No it's rare to overdose on vitamin D yeah um okay, so that's in, okay.

PATIENT X303
And there's a lot of these that you better check cause they're down to one refill.

DOCTOR X303
Yep we'll go through all of them.

PATIENT X303
I really have fun trying to get them when they run out.

DOCTOR X303
Let's go through all those.

PATIENT X303
That pharmacy joke.

DOCTOR X303
But first just to check in are you still taking your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT X303
Yeah I got a new blood pressure machine here because I think and it starts here.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
And goes on the back page because the other one was way off.

DOCTOR X303
So this was your new one you just got like a week ago or so.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.  I'm running at 130 you're talking about.

DOCTOR X303
You're a little high.

PATIENT X303
Every once in a while I'll get down but uh.

DOCTOR X303
Overall a little high.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Now I was just looking at the last time you saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
And DOCTOR you see him too it looks like.

PATIENT X303
That was just Friday.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah and they had suggested that you, so you're taking the Valsartan 160 mg in the morning and then.

PATIENT X303
No.

DOCTOR X303
What are you taking for Valsartan?

PATIENT X303
I take Valsartan 160 after dinner.  I take 160, two of the pills.  Then at bedtime I take either one or two, depending on what the blood pressure is at that time.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  So you take two in the morning?

PATIENT X303
I don't take them in the morning.

DOCTOR X303
How come you're not taking them in the morning?

PATIENT X303
Cause I'm taking them when they told me to, for years.

DOCTOR X303
They told you to take those at night?  We have written in the note that it's in the morning, that's the only reason I asked.

PATIENT X303
Well I think that'd be a lot smarter because it doesn't work very fast.  For instance.

DOCTOR X303
Right.

PATIENT X303
If I take it at dinnertime, the blood pressure, you'll notice on there the blood pressure goes up at night.

DOCTOR X303
Right.

PATIENT X303
Every night and after I've taken two of these, so they must be very slow acting.

DOCTOR X303
That's, so that's the reason I asked because what they suggested was that instead of taking that extra Valsartan if it's high you change it and make it a different medication that's faster acting that you can take if you have a high reading, called hydralazine.  It's another blood pressure pill.  It works very quickly so it'll bring you down faster.  Like you said the Valsartan doesn't work quickly.

PATIENT X303
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X303
So I think what we should do.

PATIENT X303
Why don't they put on the bottle when to take it?

DOCTOR X303
I don't know and it should be.

PATIENT X303
None of them do.

DOCTOR X303
Oh they don't put that on them?

PATIENT X303
Not a single bottle tells us when to take them.

DOCTOR X303
Well I can @@@.

PATIENT X303
This is what I take when.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  So after breakfast, okay let me check it with my list here.  Alright so amlodipine you're taking the one in the morning and then your furosemide you take in the morning, metoprolol you take a half twice a day good.

PATIENT X303
Yep.

DOCTOR X303
And then allopurinol you're only taking every other day?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
I don't even have that on here, oh yes I do.  Do you get that from us?

PATIENT X303
Yes.  Oh wait a minute, maybe I.

DOCTOR X303
No maybe you get that one.

PATIENT X303
Maybe that's the one I get at Target cause it's four dollars.

DOCTOR X303
Yes that's probably what it is and then after lunch you have a gabapentin okay and then another one in the evening okay.  Then you have the Valsartan at okay and your aspirin and then another Valsartan.  And you have the simvastatin at night.

PATIENT X303
And then that one, on the other side it's the, that was the vitamin we were just talking about.

DOCTOR X303
Oh the vitamin D and then you have you're um your pain pills, the Vicodin as needed okay.

PATIENT X303
Okay now what I have, I have a three year old bottle of, I wrote it down, I'm having runny nose and itchy eyes, you know spring has come early.

DOCTOR X303
Uh-huh.  Sure has.

PATIENT X303
And this is what I used to have.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
Uh and also on the bottle I've gotten written for itch.  I haven't seen it, is that for, is this another one?

DOCTOR X303
Yeah that's you know for allergies.

PATIENT X303
My kids have cats so I really have a problem so what I need and they're three years old so I was afraid to take them.

DOCTOR X303
We can get you some new ones, not a problem.

PATIENT X303
But I'm wondering if that's what I should be taking now.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah that should be fine and then you can get this stuff over-the-counter but if it's easier we can get it for you. It's called, you'll see it over-the-counter as Zyrtec um and it's for itchy eyes, runny nose, these types of things um.

PATIENT X303
Well put.

DOCTOR X303
You could take one a day which is probably what you were taking previously.  Do you want a prescription for this?

PATIENT X303
Yes please.

DOCTOR X303
Okay let's put that in then.  Let me get that sorted out.  Do you want to pick it up today or do you want it sent out?

PATIENT X303
No that's why I'm all dressed up; I'm going down to the big city for symphony for my birthday.

DOCTOR X303
Oh my goodness.  Oh wonderful.  Oh yeah, so it was just your birthday a couple days ago huh.

SECOND PERSON X303
Yes it was.

PATIENT X303
Like yesterday.

DOCTOR X303
How exciting.

PATIENT X303
But I've had three of them so I.

DOCTOR X303
So you're going to the xxx xxx is that the?

SECOND PERSON X303
Yeah, three nights of it.

DOCTOR X303
Oh how fun.

SECOND PERSON X303
For a celebration.

DOCTOR X303
My parents used to have season tickets and they were in the um seats that are like a lounge in the back of the orchestra so you're looking down.

SECOND PERSON X303
Oh I wanted that.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X303
We've never sat there.

DOCTOR X303
Oh it was fun.

SECOND PERSON X303
We'll have to do that sometime.

DOCTOR X303
Sometime you guys should try the tickets there cause it's really interesting to be right in front of the conductor and you get to look down on the percussionists and it's a completely different view and the sound is, in that place is great everywhere.

SECOND PERSON X303
Yeah.  We sat on the last row in the gallery.

DOCTOR X303
Oh yeah.
SECOND PERSON X303
It's wonderful.

DOCTOR X303
Its awe, I mean it's such an amazing place.

SECOND PERSON X303
It is.

DOCTOR X303
Okay, so that one's in and then I have on here that you have an albuterol inhaler.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Do you still have that one?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
Do you take it as needed?

PATIENT X303
Yes and I only seem to get wheezy at night.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
Usually every night I'll have to take a couple of puffs of that.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  I think what we'll.

PATIENT X303
Is that not on there?

DOCTOR X303
Uh it's not on; it's not on your list.

PATIENT X303
No well I don't show it there.

DOCTOR X303
It's on mine though and you still have it.

PATIENT X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
I think what we should do is have you take the valsartan um 160 mg in the morning, that after dinner dose, I think you should move it to your after breakfast dose.  Are you okay with doing that?  Because that's what they have written in your kidney doctor notes that you're taking it in the morning and I don't know why that got confused um but usually it's better to spread out those doses so that it will work for you.

PATIENT X303
You say take two, cause I get 80 mg.

DOCTOR X303
So take the two of them after breakfast.

PATIENT X303
Okay and then when do I take the next one or two?

DOCTOR X303
You know what I think probably what we should do is maybe bump you up to having you just take two in the evening.

PATIENT X303
So two in the morning and two in the evening?

DOCTOR X303
Yeah that's kind of.

PATIENT X303
When you say evening are you talking bedtime or you're talking dinnertime?

DOCTOR X303
You know what, it doesn't really matter that much um.

PATIENT X303
Well.

DOCTOR X303
You know usually with a medicine like this that you take twice a day, we space them about 12 hours apart because that's the amount of time they usually work so if you get up and you eat breakfast at 8 o'clock and you take your medicines at 9, then take it probably before bed at 9, but if you're a real early riser and you're taking them at about 6.

SECOND PERSON X303
He's not an early riser.

DOCTOR X303
Okay, okay.  So take them after breakfast and then maybe before bed.

PATIENT X303
Would you write that down please?

SECOND PERSON X303
I am.

PATIENT X303
Is there any way they can put that on the tab?

DOCTOR X303
I'm gonna change it so that you do.

PATIENT X303
Because not a single medicine there.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah I.

PATIENT X303
And uh.

DOCTOR X303
And I know, they'll probably.  I'm trying to think, you're running a little bit high um.

PATIENT X303
Yeah I'm running.

DOCTOR X303
But we don't want you to be too low either.  DOCTOR wrote in her note that um they want you to be more a goal of the 140/90s for you because we don't want you to drop too low.

PATIENT X303
I never get 90 the second one.

DOCTOR X303
Well under, under 140/90.  But your top number's usually higher than 140.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
So.

PATIENT X303
140.

DOCTOR X303
You do have a couple in the 100, 110 reading.

PATIENT X303
@@@ well I even got a 103 here.  103/46.

DOCTOR X303
We don't want you know, those low ones to go any lower.

PATIENT X303
142 but then it's 122, 19, 10, then 160, 146, 165, 150.

DOCTOR X303
So you're not, you're not really far off goal.  You're not so high that I want to make a lot of changes so maybe instead what.

PATIENT X303
Maybe it won't be high if I take them at the right time.

DOCTOR X303
Well that's what I'm thinking.  You might be under better control if you're going to take your valsartan in the morning now and you're seeing DOCTOR again next month.

PATIENT X303
Yeah because the creatinine got high.

DOCTOR X303
Creatinine went up a little bit.

PATIENT X303
She wants another blood test in six weeks.

DOCTOR X303
So yeah okay.  So maybe that's the only change I want to make today is to really change the time.

PATIENT X303
Right.

DOCTOR X303
So we'll see if that helps um, cause I'd hate to add another medication and have you go any lower.  We don't want to see you get too low because then you can start seeing things like dizziness or.

SECOND PERSON X303
He went through a period of that.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X303
Now if he takes two pills @@@.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X303
It's hard to change.

DOCTOR X303
Right.

SECOND PERSON X303
The medications.

DOCTOR X303
I'd almost rather you be just a little above goal then to worry about falling.

SECOND PERSON X303
He really feels lousy when it's low.

DOCTOR X303
Oh I'm, it's a terrible feeling I mean, so 150s-160s but with some lower values in the 100s-120s.  We'll give you valsartan after dinner 160 mg and also before bed either 80 or 160 mg okay.  How are you feeling overall?  Are you feeling okay?

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  So you're not having low blood pressure where you're actually getting real dizzy or lightheaded?

PATIENT X303
No I haven't had that.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
And I haven't had any swelling either.

DOCTOR X303
That's great.  That's good.  And then the Vicodin is controlling the pain okay?  You have the arthritis pain is that right?

PATIENT X303
Well it's funny how that, it does the back and hips really good.  I mean plus the fact that my family doctor I see every six months.

DOCTOR X303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X303
Gave me some exercises in the morning.

DOCTOR X303
Oh that's good.

PATIENT X303
Back exercises.  And that, so I really, I was always taking six Vicodin and most of the time now I take four.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
But if I can't sleep because I'm in so much pain but the Vicodin doesn't work for the shoulders.  It seems to work from here down.

DOCTOR X303
That's a little strange.

PATIENT X303
And that's strange isn't it.

DOCTOR X303
Hmm.  Have you tried ever anything else?  I mean that's a pretty good pain medicine but.

PATIENT X303
No.

DOCTOR X303
Maybe the shoulder, we're seeing a little more inflammation.

PATIENT X303
Well I just.

DOCTOR X303
I don't want you to take any.

PATIENT X303
When I had my six month with the family doctor.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
And he gave me a cortisone shot.

DOCTOR X303
Oh okay.

PATIENT X303
He wouldn't do the other one because he wants to see if it works and it worked.

DOCTOR X303
Good.

PATIENT X303
So I may go back and have another one, but I had the right shoulder replaced.

DOCTOR X303
Oh you did okay.

PATIENT X303
That was eight years ago and it's the worst but and I was trying to get an appointment with that guy and I don't know, they don't answer their phones.

DOCTOR X303
You saw an orthopedic doctor?

PATIENT X303
Oh yeah, the one that.

SECOND PERSON X303
@@@.

PATIENT X303
The one that, no it was at the xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X303
Okay. 

PATIENT X303
xxx xxx, for both my back and both knees have been replaced too.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Are you doing okay with the orthopedic doctors there or did you want to see someone here?

PATIENT X303
No.

DOCTOR X303
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X303
I got enough doctors.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Alright so we did the medicines um and then you have your allopurinol you get at Target.  The aspirin, baby aspirin you take, we looked at that one and then your eye drops, it looks like and you get that from someone else.

PATIENT X303
Yeah after this doctor here I wouldn't take them.

DOCTOR X303
Oh really.  @@@.

PATIENT X303
Which made my eye doctor mad cause he was involved somehow with the hospital here and so I went to her and she said you got to quit him and bring all your files to me.  It was a woman downstairs here.

DOCTOR X303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X303
And I said all I wanted to do was get the medication and she said nope won't do it.

DOCTOR X303
Hmm.

PATIENT X303
Eye drops so I was paying, well I just went generic it went from $97 a month to 12 or something.

DOCTOR X303
Oh well that's good.

PATIENT X303
Crazy.

DOCTOR X303
That's a lot better isn't it?

SECOND PERSON X303
Wow.

PATIENT X303
So it's uh and one of them is about $40 and one of them is $20.  I went to Canada to get one of them.

DOCTOR X303
Hmm and they tried to get them and they wouldn't give them to you here?

PATIENT X303
Nope.

DOCTOR X303
Hmm.

PATIENT X303
Now any other time, like my heart doctor's recommendation.

DOCTOR X303
Hmm.

PATIENT X303
And he would fax it here and they would you know whoever would, I've had five of you.

DOCTOR X303
Right I know.

PATIENT X303
But they automatically would put it in.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
The heart doctor did that and I don't know that my family doctor.

DOCTOR X303
Well if you fax me a prescription from your eye doctor I can try to get them here.  If I have prescription I can try to put it in.  @@@.

PATIENT X303
Well it's down to you know $12.

DOCTOR X303
Well that's a lot better yeah.

PATIENT X303
Yeah it's not worth doing now I don't think but uh.

DOCTOR X303
Maybe we can have.

PATIENT X303
Well you give me three capsules of course I don't know what that would cost outside.  So many of that stuff is in the $4 list now.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
At the drug store.

DOCTOR X303
It makes it much easier.

PATIENT X303
But I don't know and you.

DOCTOR X303
I think ours are 8.

PATIENT X303
Uh I think they're 9 now, they were $8 now they're 9.

DOCTOR X303
Oh they're 9, they went up.

PATIENT X303
Which is alright but when you're only getting three pills I don't know.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.  Well we'll go through your lab tests real quick.  Your vitamin D, as I said, it looks okay.  A little low still so we'll keep you on the same thing that the kidney doctor wanted.  Um I'm sure they talked to you a little bit, your creatinine is elevated as you know.

PATIENT X303
Yeah but I didn't get the point there was anything I could do about it.

DOCTOR X303
No I think they're just observing like keeping away from any medications that could make it worse and I think controlling the blood pressure as well.

PATIENT X303
That's what.

DOCTOR X303
As you can is the best thing.  Blood counts look fine, no problems there.  No anemia anything like that.  Um urine looks good.  Electrolytes all look fine.  We talked about the creatinine.  Cholesterol looks good, no problems with that and the liver.

PATIENT X303
I'm surprised that's as good cause they cut that down, I'm cutting out the pill I have in quarters.

DOCTOR X303
Oh really?

PATIENT X303
Yeah what does it show here? 

DOCTOR X303
Simvastatin.

PATIENT X303
Yeah well I probably have 80 originally.

DOCTOR X303
Oh and now they're.

PATIENT X303
I was taking a half of that.

DOCTOR X303
You're at 20.  Are you getting your 40 mg pills now?  You are supposed to be getting 40.

PATIENT X303
I haven't gotten any yet because I got them once but I had so many left over that I'm cutting up.

DOCTOR X303
Oh.

PATIENT X303
And I've been taking those.

DOCTOR X303
Well that's, that's annoying but it's fine if you want to use those up.  I know it's annoying to cut them in fourths.  The next one you get should be a 40 mg pill so you'll only have to cut that one in half.

PATIENT X303
And you cut that in half.

DOCTOR X303
Right but the cholesterol levels look really good.  Your liver function looks completely normal and your iron is normal too.  Your iron level, so everything looks actually really pretty good.  Um except for the kidney function and we talked about that already.  So keep going on that and then make sure you have a refill.  Gabapentin you're taking basically two capsules a day.  Is it easier for you to get 90 day supplies of things?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
Let's change that then.  Some of these are at 30 or 60; I don't know why they do that.

PATIENT X303
I don't know either.

DOCTOR X303
So the next time you should get 90 day supply, we'll give you three refills so you don't have to keep calling.  Metoprolol oh that one's a 30 day supply, see I don't know why they have it.  Let's give you a 90 day supply of that one too.  And then hopefully it'll last you a little longer.  It looks like pantoprazole has been renewed.  That's the one you take for the acid reflux.  

PATIENT X303
Has it been renewed?

DOCTOR X303
It's been renewed.

PATIENT X303
Because that's the one that ran out.

DOCTOR X303
Simvastatin.

PATIENT X303
And how many?

DOCTOR X303
That's a 90 day.

PATIENT X303
But you're putting that in for.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
Some more refills, because we figure what you're six months.

DOCTOR X303
Yep.  Yep so you should have at least you know.

PATIENT X303
Now the one you can't do for six months is the Vicodin.

DOCTOR X303
Right I can only do a 30 day supply.  Amlodipine, let's give you a 90 day supply of that one cause you're on a 30 day supply okay.

PATIENT X303
How many refills can you give me on Vicodin?

DOCTOR X303
Um I don't think, I don't know that there's a limit.  I can give you as many refills as you want.

PATIENT X303
Well somebody said they could only go for four refills or something.

DOCTOR X303
You have two right now.

PATIENT X303
That changes and I don't think it's a good as it used to be.  I don't know what they did to it.

DOCTOR X303
They took a little bit of the Tylenol out of it is what they did.

PATIENT X303
Did that affect it?

DOCTOR X303
Well you know, the stronger drug in the medication, the hydrocodone was not changed and they decreased the Tylenol because they're finding that higher doses of Tylenol can cause liver problems along down the road so having less Tylenol in there is less harmful to your liver but it may have taken away some of the pain.

PATIENT X303
Yeah it doesn't work as good.

DOCTOR X303
Okay I've given you a bunch of refills of that one so you'll have enough.  Albuterol you have plenty of refills on your inhaler.

PATIENT X303
Yeah I don't use that as often.

DOCTOR X303
Pantoprazole was already done.  Lasix, the furosemide you have a lot of refills but it's only a 30 day supply so let me make it a 90 day supply and we want everything to be 90 okay and valsartan you only have a 30 day supply so let me can change that one.  So this will basically just mean that the next time you order it, it should be 90 days worth, which will make things easier, you don't have to call as often and then the calcitriol.

PATIENT X303
It makes it easier until you change the medicine and then I've got 90 days of it.

DOCTOR X303
Oh yeah.  Well that's true.  Hopefully we won't be making too many changes and then the calcitriol, wait were you still taking that one?

PATIENT X303
What one?

DOCTOR X303
The calcitriol?

SECOND PERSON X303
Calcitriol?

DOCTOR X303
I don't think.

PATIENT X303
What is that?

DOCTOR X303
It's another type of vitamin D actually.  You had two times weekly is what I have on here.

SECOND PERSON X303
He might take that I don't know.

PATIENT X303
Look on our list.

DOCTOR X303
And then the big vitamin D we already and your metoprolol it's showing me has expired.

SECOND PERSON X303
What's that?

PATIENT X303
What did you call it?

DOCTOR X303
Calcitriol, this guy.

PATIENT X303
Well I'm taking it.

DOCTOR X303
Twice a week you're on that one?

PATIENT X303
Yep.

SECOND PERSON X303
Oh my God and you're taking the once a month as well?

DOCTOR X303
It's yeah.

SECOND PERSON X303
Gee, that's a lot of vitamin D.

DOCTOR X303
Sometimes when people are low, so I mean I don't think I was the one who prescribed that for you.  Oh.

PATIENT X303
That's what I'm doing.

DOCTOR X303
So was this, this is from your primary doctor okay.

PATIENT X303
No he is my primary doctor.

DOCTOR X303
Oh but you made this?

PATIENT X303
I made this also because everybody asks me.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
These are all the operations and.

DOCTOR X303
Oh yeah, this is good, okay.

PATIENT X303
Do you want a copy of it?

DOCTOR X303
No that's okay cause we have most of this information in here but it's good to have that with you.

PATIENT X303
But does that clarify this?

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
Cause I take, what's there I take.

DOCTOR X303
So let's get you some refills then if it's, you know it seems to be working.  And the metoprolol we've got, oh wait that one twice.

SECOND PERSON X303
How many milligrams is that vitamin D?

DOCTOR X303
0.25 micrograms.  It's a different kind of vitamin D.

SECOND PERSON X303
Oh is it?  Okay.

DOCTOR X303
Um it works differently.  I can't tell you all the mechanisms but, make sure I am telling you the right thing.  You know I think it's because of the kidney disease, if I'm not mistaken.  I did that one twice.  So let's sign all those and these should be all refilled now.  It's telling me, why are you beeping at me.  It's telling me you have side effects to furosemide before, is that true?

PATIENT X303
No. 

DOCTOR X303
Are you taking the furosemide?

PATIENT X303
No, no I haven't had any side effects from furosemide.

DOCTOR X303
@@@.

PATIENT X303
There was another one that I did have side effects with.  I forget what it was.  I think that it was one that I was taking when I was, before I had that tumor removed, what's that kidney, I forget.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Alright so I have that all straightened out.  Let's do an exam and make sure everything looks okay.  Have a seat up here.  What time is your concert today?

SECOND PERSON X303
1:30.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
When is it?

SECOND PERSON X303
1:30.

DOCTOR X303
I'm gonna retake your blood pressure just to see if it's gone down.

PATIENT X303
I think it's gone down since I walked a half a mile.  You know since they changed the parking.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah I know.

PATIENT X303
It's really a hike.

DOCTOR X303
And you took all your blood pressure pills this morning?

PATIENT X303
Yep.

DOCTOR X303
Good.  About 152/72.

PATIENT X303
Yeah see that's unusual too cause usually when I take those pills I go over to the Health Club and I ride the bike for a half an hour.

DOCTOR X303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X303
And I walk the treadmill for ten minutes.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
And when I get home, I take it, you know I walk in the pool sometimes and uh when I get home it'll be in the 120s.

DOCTOR X303
Oh well that's terrific.  I'm just going to peek in your ear.

PATIENT X303
So the exercise must be.

DOCTOR X303
Oh that's helping a lot yeah that's great.

PATIENT X303
Helping.

DOCTOR X303
You've got some wax in there.

PATIENT X303
But I notice uh.

DOCTOR X303
I'm going to look for you can put them back in.

PATIENT X303
Yeah put me back on the air.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah that's why I don't really want to give you more blood pressure medicine because you have periods of time where you're normal, 120.  We don't want you to be a lot lower than that I mean then we'll start seeing some dizziness.  Open wide for me, say ah.

PATIENT X303
Ah.

DOCTOR X303
Good, and lift the end of your tongue, good.  Take your glasses off just for sec I want to take a peek at your pupils here.  Okay, you can put them back on.  Let me take a quick feel of the neck here.  Oh maybe a little bit of a lymph node on this side.  So do you have a little bit of?

PATIENT X303
One of them was removed.

DOCTOR X303
This side maybe.  Maybe that's why it's a little different.  Do you have a removal on that side?

PATIENT X303
I don't remember which side cause I was about 30 years old.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
And I'm now 87 so that was a long time ago.

DOCTOR X303
Long time ago.  A couple deep breaths here.  Good.  Alright go ahead and lay back for me, look at the belly.  I'm going to untuck you for a second here.  Have your bowel movements been normal?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
No blood or tarry stools, black stools?

PATIENT X303
Nope.  A stomach ache every once in a while that nobody can figure out.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah I think we talked about that last time you were here.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.  My family doctor said I should have a test at the hospital but.

DOCTOR X303
How often are you getting it now?

PATIENT X303
Well I think, about two or three weeks apart.

DOCTOR X303
And it's still sort of late in the day?

PATIENT X303
But it wasn't as severe last time.

DOCTOR X303
Sit up for me.

PATIENT X303
Only lasted four hours instead of 12.  I've had them last from after breakfast I would get it on Sunday so I didn't have to go to church and it would last until 11 o'clock at night.

DOCTOR X303
Wait one more test for you.  Lets check your strength here.  Toes up in the air, you've been getting them less frequently, push down and kick up.

PATIENT X303
I don't know if they're less frequent.

DOCTOR X303
Push back.

PATIENT X303
There's not as severe.

DOCTOR X303
A little shorter okay.  This @@@ up in the air, good and this one, ooh, you okay, got the hip huh.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
I'm sorry about that.  Give me a good squeeze, okay pull me towards you, now push me away good.  Arms up like this, nice and strong.

PATIENT X303
Careful of that.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah in the shoulder.

PATIENT X303
The right one.

DOCTOR X303
Oh this one okay.  Pretty good strength though, good.  Go ahead and relax.  Can you shrug your shoulders up, okay.  Can you put your arms up to your sides?  A little stiff.

PATIENT X303
That's as far as they go.

DOCTOR X303
Okay go ahead and relax, good.  Puff out your cheeks, @@@.  There you go.  Stick your tongue out and to the right, to the left.  Let me see your teeth, good.  Now squint your eyes closed real tight for me, good.  Open them up.  Feel the same on both sides of your face?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Chin to your chest like this and head all look at the ceiling.  A little stiffness in the neck.

PATIENT X303
A lot of stiffness.

DOCTOR X303
A lot of stiffness in the neck.  Can you turn your head towards the door and resist me, turn your head, keep going good and that side good okay.  Need a quick listen to your neck and then we'll be done here.  Turn back towards the door there and hold your breath.  Okay let it out, turn towards me and hold your breath again.  Okay good.  Alright go ahead and sit back down.  Do you have any trouble with your stools when you're having one of these stomach episodes?

PATIENT X303
No.

DOCTOR X303
Okay and does anything tend to make it better or does it go away on its own?

PATIENT X303
Well it doesn't hurt when I sit and it doesn't hurt when I lie down.

DOCTOR X303
So it's when you're up and about.

PATIENT X303
So I go back to bed.

DOCTOR X303
Oh I see okay and then when you get up again do you just feel better?

PATIENT X303
I don't get up until it does get better.

DOCTOR X303
I see okay.

PATIENT X303
But they used to last 11 hours, almost to the time.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah I remember you were having more problems with them.

PATIENT X303
But now I had a slight one yesterday when I went to my family doctor and he set up and I'm sorry I didn't write that, you wrote it down but you wouldn't remember it, what test he's giving me but there's a lower abdomen.  He's wondering about a artery blockage or something.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X303
So I'm waiting for the hospital, the xxx xxx xxx to call me to go over for a test.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
That he called for but I can't tell you what it is because the name is unbelievable.  It's not something simple thing like lower stomach check.

DOCTOR X303
So they're working that up with your primary care, okay.  Just let me know, you know what happens or if you need us to do anything here.

PATIENT X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
Okay, let's just make sure we're up-to-date on all our other health stuff um.  Have you had a colonoscopy in the past?

PATIENT X303
Yeah I used to take company physicals every year.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X303
That was a long time ago.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
I haven't had one in 20 some years.

DOCTOR X303
We don't, there's a certain age at which we stop doing those.

PATIENT X303
Well that's what my doctor said.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah so I don't think we need to worry about it.  I was just wondering if there'd been one done because of the stomach pain okay so.

PATIENT X303
Depending on what he finds he may want to do more so.

DOCTOR X303
Okay and then let's just double check where we have with the immunizations, flu shot, pneumonia, tetanus and everything is up-to-date.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
So good and did we ever, were you a smoker in the past?

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
Did we ever, has anybody ever looked at your um aorta, do an ultrasound of the aorta?  We usually do it for men who've had a history of smoking.  Again you're probably over the recommended age where we tend to do them but we usually start them at 65 um and just check and see if that big vessel in your belly has dilated at all.  Do you ever remember having that done?

PATIENT X303
I've had so many tests.

DOCTOR X303
I'm sure you have.

PATIENT X303
I don't know that that was one of them.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  I think you're over the age we usually do them but I'll double check.

PATIENT X303
You don't show it in your records?

DOCTOR X303
I don't show it in ours no.

PATIENT X303
Cause I did something here but I don't remember what it was.  It was one of those, it's a little round.

DOCTOR X303
That would've been it.  Was the thing like they use when a woman's pregnant?

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Yep, then that's probably what it was.

PATIENT X303
I don't know if that was here or at xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X303
Alright we reviewed that, I thinks that's all.

PATIENT X303
But I did, I had that.

DOCTOR X303
And you have all your lab tests done with us right?  Do you get any blood work done outside?

PATIENT X303
No.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  So we'll keep doing that.  We'll do some checks in six months and make sure everything is looking fine so and you're getting some blood tests done with the kidney doctor but I think.

PATIENT X303
Yes.

DOCTOR X303
Let me just see when that is ordered for you.

PATIENT X303
She said six weeks.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah, yep so I'll double check and you know if nothing's been done in six months we'll just kind of update everything but it sounds like they're actually following you pretty closely too with the blood tests.

SECOND PERSON X303
They're very good at that.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah good.  Um and I think we talked about everything else um.  I just have to run everything by my attending before we let you go but is there anything else you wanted to bring up or any concerns you have?

PATIENT X303
No.

SECOND PERSON X303
No I think we've covered everything.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
You've done a good job.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
Covering it today.

DOCTOR X303
Okay good.  Well let me just go run everything by her um.

PATIENT X303
Who is she?

DOCTOR X303
She DOCTOR is the attending that supervises the clinics or we have two of them DOCTOR um and we just run everything by them before we let you head out and I'll just double check the blood pressure thing.  I don't think I want to add anything just because sometimes you're just fine or even low and I don't want you to be much lower.

PATIENT X303
Yeah I'm confused too because I think I been, I don't think the blood pressure machine has been correct.

DOCTOR X303
Maybe now that you have your new one.

PATIENT X303
Maybe it'll, I hope that one's correct although it was off yesterday when I took it.

DOCTOR X303
And we'll start the, we'll start the valsartan try a morning dose and see if that makes you a little more stable throughout the day.

PATIENT X303
And you've got uh 160 in the morning.

DOCTOR X303
160 in the morning.

PATIENT X303
And either 80 or 160 at night.

DOCTOR X303
Right depending on what you see in your blood pressure.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Well let me just go double check everything with my attending might have another suggestion so I'll just be back in a few minutes okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  61:57  DOCTOR IN:  81:29)

DOCTOR X303
Okay, sorry that took a while.

SECOND PERSON X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
I know you guys are ready to go so, we just talked a little bit about your blood pressure um and I think what we're gonna do is like I told you we're gonna start taking the valsartan in the morning, that two pills in the morning and then um as needed depending on what your blood pressure is running that day, take one or two then 12 hours later in the meantime and then when you follow up with DOCTOR next month then you can show her what you're getting at home and they can decide if they want to add anything else or if we want to just keep you where you are okay.  And then the other question I have for you, which we talked about that last time and I forgot to ask you was, is that gabapentin helping at all?  Do you feel?  Any change?

PATIENT X303
You know I wouldn't know unless I quit taking it.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah I know we talked last time that maybe it wasn't, wasn't really doing much for you and we were gonna see how it went.  You were put on that for the arthritis or for do we really know?

PATIENT X303
Well I was going to a pain doctor and at one time they were gonna install, they tried that device where they put the wires up on both sides of the spinal cord and then you have a remote control controlling vibrations and if it worked it was on the outside and if it worked they were gonna implant it.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

PATIENT X303
And we got to that stage and then I had that angina attack and they had to put in a splint and then they decided they wouldn't do that at all.

DOCTOR X303
Well did you feel like that was working?

PATIENT X303
Uh, actually I quit using the outside stimulator because I didn't, it helped when I had the severe pain but the Vicodin started handling it and the exercise started taking care of that pain pretty good so I.

DOCTOR X303
Do you want to try to get off the gabapentin?  I mean if you're not having a lot of nerve pain then we can.

PATIENT X303
What's nerve?  How.

DOCTOR X303
You know with the numbness, burning, tingling pain fingers, toes, shooting pains that go down the legs into the feet or down the back, into the buttocks um.

PATIENT X303
Nope don't have any of that.

DOCTOR X303
Um sort of like um more of a burning inner pain than uh like a.

PATIENT X303
Alright there you've got that send up, they're not sending all of these automatically are they?

DOCTOR X303
No I think you have to call when you run out, even.

PATIENT X303
Okay but I.

DOCTOR X303
But I think.

PATIENT X303
The one that I ran out of was.

DOCTOR X303
Which one did you run out?  Oh I see what you're saying um so the cetirizine you'll get automatically because it's a new medicine.  The other ones I think what I did was just renew and so if you find that you're getting low on the pills just call them and say hey I need them by next refill.  You have plenty of refills now and you'll be getting 90 day amounts.

PATIENT X303
Okay so.

DOCTOR X303
@@@.

PATIENT X303
Maybe I should quit the gabapentin.

DOCTOR X303
I was going to ask you, that gives you one less pill to take.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
We could see, sometimes gabapentin makes people feel a little tired.  I don't know if that's been a problem but it might give you more, I don't know so.

PATIENT X303
Yeah I fall asleep reading the paper.

DOCTOR X303
So we could give it a try.  The way we do it is you're taking 300 mg twice a day, what I would suggest is we usually taper it so you don't stop cold turkey.  Um take one pill for about a week, just to let your body get accustomed to it and then we can probably stop it completely.  You're not on a very high dose.  We can actually have, gabapentin can be a very high dose for people with a lot of nerve pain.  But with arthritis we don’t really see a lot of nerve pain, we see more of an inflammation pain, an achy pain and with nerve issues we see a lot of people with diabetes or things like that and you don't have any issues with those types of things so.

PATIENT X303
Alright I'll.

DOCTOR X303
You can give it a shot.

PATIENT X303
I'll cut it back to one and see if it makes.

DOCTOR X303
Cut it back to one and if you start to feel like your pain is getting worse, then by all means we can keep it on there.  There's no real side effects or toxicities to gabapentin so if its.

PATIENT X303
Except sleepiness.

DOCTOR X303
Of the gabapentin yes.

PATIENT X303
This is one of the things that bothers me.

DOCTOR X303
You do, it can cause some sleepiness.  Vicodin can cause a little sleepiness too.  The Vicodin pills can do that.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
So

SECOND PERSON X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
So you know try it and see how you feel.  If you don't notice any difference after a week just stop, stop the medicine completely.

PATIENT X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
Okay um and then you don’t have to call.  I'll keep it on your list for now just in case but you don't have to call for a refill if you're not using it obviously and so the next time you come we'll discontinue it completely if you're not taking it.

PATIENT X303
Alright.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X303
Cetirizine?

DOCTOR X303
Right. 

SECOND PERSON X303
So what does that do?

DOCTOR X303
Uh so its, its for allergies.

SECOND PERSON X303
Is that the new one?

DOCTOR X303
That was the new one.

SECOND PERSON X303
The one you were adding.

DOCTOR X303
It's, you've heard of it as Zyrtec, yeah that would be a 10 mg pill that you can just take one time.

PATIENT X303
Oh that and the one that I'm out of which was the uh.

DOCTOR X303
The vitamin D.

PATIENT X303
Vitamin D.

DOCTOR X303
That one should be on its way.  If you don't get it in the next week, call them, call the Pharmacy.

PATIENT X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
Okay cause it should be coming.  You have a little time.  You said you took your last one on the 15th.

PATIENT X303
Yeah the 15th.

DOCTOR X303
So call them in the next week if you don't see it in the mail okay.  And the Zyrtec just take it, you know, once a day.  If your allergies seem to be worse when you wake up in the morning take it when you get up in the morning and it should last you throughout the day okay.

PATIENT X303
Is that quick acting?

DOCTOR X303
Uh it should start taking effect in the first half hour to hour you take it.

PATIENT X303
Sometimes my nose runs all day long.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah um and you can use over-the-counter stuff too if you have a lot of.

PATIENT X303
Yeah there was one I read that said if you have glaucoma ask your doctor before using it and that was the one I got at xxx.

DOCTOR X303
Which one was that?

PATIENT X303
They called it an allergy pill.

DOCTOR X303
Oh just.

PATIENT X303
They don't have a name on it.

DOCTOR X303
Oh.

PATIENT X303
Allergy.

DOCTOR X303
Well bring it in next time if you want to talk about it cause I'll need to see what ingredients are in it and we can talk to the eye doctors about that okay.

PATIENT X303
So I haven't wanted to take that.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah.

PATIENT X303
And that made me sleepy if I remember.

DOCTOR X303
Allergy pills can sometimes make you a little sleepy.  They can also make you feel a little bit dry cause.

PATIENT X303
I have yeah.  

DOCTOR X303
So.

PATIENT X303
Is this what I'm getting, also make you sleepy?

DOCTOR X303
I don't think so.  I think this one is a good one for the daytime um let me just see, I'm looking at the side effects.  There are like some of those decongestants out there they recommend you only take them at night um.  So yeah some people can be drowsy.  So see how you feel, you can take a half also of this medication.  If it works you can just have a half, 5 mg.

PATIENT X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
Uh and see how that goes okay.  Any other questions for me?

SECOND PERSON X303
I actually feel great.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.  Well, just call me if anything comes up okay.

PATIENT X303
That's a joke.

DOCTOR X303
Well I know but what you can do is call the scheduling number.  I admit it doesn’t always work, call the general clinic schedule number and say I want to leave a message for DOCTOR and they will send me an e-mail and I'll be able to get back to you in the next couple days.  If not.

PATIENT X303
You're only in here on.

DOCTOR X303
I'm only in here for one week and then I'll be @@@ four weeks and then I'm in @@@ and then I'll be back in five weeks.  So I'm here one week out of every five.

SECOND PERSON X303
Hmm.

DOCTOR X303
Is how it works now?

PATIENT X303
So check your e-mail.

DOCTOR X303
But I still get my e-mails even when I'm in the hospital and I can give you, I can call you without a problem okay.

PATIENT X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
So they'll schedule you for my clinic um, what do you, do you come every six months to see me?

SECOND PERSON X303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X303
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Is that right?  So that'll be around September time and like I said we'll look for some labs.  I'll look at the labs and see if you, you know.

PATIENT X303
I usually have blood tests before.

DOCTOR X303
It worked well that way because then we can go over them when you're here.  So plan on a couple weeks for the blood tests.  Let's see uh yes.

SECOND PERSON X303
@@@.

DOCTOR X303
Yes they're not going to @@@.  A little disconcerting.

SECOND PERSON X303
You don't have anything to walk on.

PATIENT X303
@@@.

DOCTOR X303
I know they're doing some constructions right off the.

SECOND PERSON X303
Thank you.

PATIENT X303

SECOND PERSON X303

DOCTOR X303
I hope you have a lovely day.  Here's your folder and you check out with one of these nurses, people at the desk here okay.  Bye.  @@@.

PATIENT X303
And they'll make the appointment?

DOCTOR X303
I don't think I can make it that far.  I don't think they make an appointment that far ahead.  You'll get a reminder letter okay.

SECOND PERSON X303
That helps.

PATIENT X303
Yeah.

DOCTOR X303
Yeah you'll get it like five months before the six months.

SECOND PERSON X303
Okay.

DOCTOR X303
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X303
Alrighty.

PATIENT LEAVES:  90:54.

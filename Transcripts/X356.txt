DOCTOR X356
Hi.

PATIENT X356
How are you?

DOCTOR X356
Good, good to see you again.  How you doing?

PATIENT X356
Not too bad, not to bad.

DOCTOR X356
Good.

PATIENT X356
I had uh, I had some disappointing news this morning, I looked, I uh, my diabetic, I been taking the wrong dosage of this medication so my sugar was up so I had to you know get it down again you know and yeah I have to, I wasn't eating right.  So I know that so you know I have to, cause I usually eat fairly good you know, track of that stuff you know so.  But we got that straightened out so.

DOCTOR X356
Good.

PATIENT X356
I was faint you know I was thin.  She thought she was sending me home but I said no I had another appointment though.  Have you found out any results of that test?  Do you remember the test I took for my blood?

DOCTOR X356
The for your @@@?

PATIENT X356
Well I know @@@ and they didn't find anything.

DOCTOR X356
Exactly.

PATIENT X356
Okay now I went, I saw my heart doctor since then.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
He said stay off @@@.

DOCTOR X356
Yep.

PATIENT X356
Okay.

DOCTOR X356
I read that.

PATIENT X356
I have not, I'm anxious to see what my results are now on that.  See really the main reason I really wanted to come today, I haven't, you know I tried to get a hold of you several times.  You were on vacation or something like that, it was during Christmas.

DOCTOR X356
Oh.

PATIENT X356
Or December.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
You were gone for a while and we were playing telephone tag.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
And you called me from your house or you might even call me from home.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
And I really appreciate that.  I couldn't get a hold of you and you couldn't get a hold of me because every time you called, I called back and nothing.

DOCTOR X356
Oh I know, that happens sometimes, it's hard.  So your blood count is what you want to know.

PATIENT X356
Yeah I guess that's what I need to know, I have no idea what I need to know but.

DOCTOR X356
Well we'll.

PATIENT X356
As long as it looks good.

DOCTOR X356
So, your urine you still have some protein in your urine.

PATIENT X356
Yeah she told me that already yeah.

DOCTOR X356
You knew that already.  Yeah.  And you know about your A1c so I'll skip over that.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X356
This is your CBC so infection-fighting cells look great, normal.  Hemoglobin that's what @@@ when you bleed.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X356
So that's your, the blood count I think you're worried about.  13 is normal.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.  Where am I at?

DOCTOR X356
You're at 13.

PATIENT X356
13 oh good.

DOCTOR X356
You're normal.

PATIENT X356
Good.  Now I cut back on the iron.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
Because you told me if after a month or I finished ferritin, I'm taking one a day.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
Is that right or not?

DOCTOR X356
Yeah so that's correct, that is what I told you um but I'm gonna show you we got some iron studies on you and your iron saturation's a little on the lower side so I definitely still see and so is your iron 53.

PATIENT X356
Should I go up to two a day?

DOCTOR X356
Now have you had problems with constipation?  I think I'm going.

PATIENT X356
Yeah @@@.  I mean I've been going but it's been really been @@@.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
You it just hasn't been you know and every once in a while I get a good bowel movement.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
But it seems like every three days is a good bowel movement.  Every other day it's kind of sort of okay, today I have not had one.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
So I just kind of figured now would be safe.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.

PATIENT X356
I mean that's why I feel constipation I'm probably not but who knows but when I go, I go, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X356
Right.

PATIENT X356
I don't know why but I'm taking two a day, two of those um, you know the black little type thing.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
I need to, I got plenty of those.

DOCTOR X356
The Docusate Senna.

PATIENT X356
I've got plenty of those.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.  Well you only have one refill so I'll refill those for you.

PATIENT X356
Thank you.

DOCTOR X356
So my thing with the iron is, I think you should at least continue to take one a day.  If you can't handle it.

PATIENT X356
Oh I say if it's normal I'll @@@ again.

DOCTOR X356
Because of the constipation I don't think you necessarily have to go up to two a day, you know.

PATIENT X356
Yeah.

DOCTOR X356
Those really are constipating pills.  You're not so low your hemoglobin, which is that blood count is in the normal range.

PATIENT X356
That's what I been @@@, I was really worried about that.

DOCTOR X356
So I'm fine with staying at one, one a day.

PATIENT X356
I haven't had any chest pain.  Remember I had chest pains on you know.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
I don't have it anymore.

DOCTOR X356
Oh wonderful.

PATIENT X356
And I think that's because I didn't have any blood you know.

DOCTOR X356
That's kind of essential for life, not enough blood.

PATIENT X356
You know.

DOCTOR X356
So do you want to go over the rest of your labs or did she go over those with you?

PATIENT X356
Hmm.  

DOCTOR X356
Uh the diabetic doctor.

PATIENT X356
Yeah she went over some stuff.  You can tell me what you want to tell me and then.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.  So cholesterol.

PATIENT X356
Yeah I got all that.

DOCTOR X356
Got all that.

PATIENT X356
Yeah and she said it was high.

DOCTOR X356
Um your electrolytes look good.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X356
Your creatinine looks great.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X356
So you're at 0.8.

PATIENT X356
I was worried about my electrolytes, I really was.  I thought that I would uh, now what's making me feel, I feel a little dizzy sometimes.  Could that be because my sugar is high?  It's not frequent.

DOCTOR X356
@@@.

PATIENT X356
Dizzy, a little bit, just a little bit.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
I just feel real lightheaded.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Now it's just a little bit lately but about the last two weeks.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.

PATIENT X356
Not all the time.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
A little bit once in a while.

DOCTOR X356
Is it only when you're standing or immediately after you stand up?

PATIENT X356
No.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.

PATIENT X356
Not like it used to be uh uh.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.  Lightheaded even when you're sitting sometimes?

PATIENT X356
Well, like they took my test this morning on my lower end of my blood pressure.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
It was 40.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
48 I believe it was.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
And that's low.  Why is that, what causes that being low like that, can you tell me that?

DOCTOR X356
Variations in blood pressure and we've got you on blood pressure medicine um to control your blood pressure.  So really that low number um, a 48, shouldn't be causing you symptoms of lightheadedness.

PATIENT X356
Okay so that, so partly, I guarantee it's probably my sugar then.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.  I mean it could be your blood pressure but I'd be more worried about the higher number being real low causing lightheadedness than the lower number being a little bit lower.

PATIENT X356
Now I get this @@@ lightheaded and it's, I can't even put it into words.  It's not all the time, it's just very, once in a while it lasts about maybe 10 minutes.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
For some reason.  My diabetic person said I got to get more exercise and uh I know I work but it's still not enough exercise.  You know what I mean; I'm not getting really much over there.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
I mean I do some things but I don't do anything real physical nor do I want to do anything real physical.  I want to do more aerobic type things like walking and stuff like that you know.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
I don't @@@.  I do a lot of standing and sitting.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
But @@@.

DOCTOR X356
What's your plan to do more exercise?

PATIENT X356
Um I'll tell you what, plan B is I have no plan.  Plan A is I have no plan um but I was thinking now that my sugar is you know, I'm starting to get a little concerned about it and uh I have, where I work is this gorgeous park.  I mean everybody and their brother's walking around this darn place and I'm not doing anything, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
I watch them walk you know but I don't do a damn thing to help you know so.  I don't know.

DOCTOR X356
So how many days a week do you work?

PATIENT X356
Too many.  I work between five and six days a week.

DOCTOR X356
Five and six days a week.

PATIENT X356
And I work eight hours a day when I work.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
But it's not hard work.  It's just like once in a while he'll have me come, I'll stay late at night.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
Cause I'm what they call, I work opposite ends.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
He's doing this, I'm doing that.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Okay so I'm like they call a closer.  You know @@@ the closer only, well I close okay.

DOCTOR X356
Sure.

PATIENT X356
As long as I can make sure the person's really @@@ and again that's a little stressful but not real stressful.  It's not like my old job used to be you know when I was really working.  You know this is a piece of cake believe me @@@.  But then I have to come in early in the morning.  See I leave between 8:30 9 o'clock at night and pretty soon it'll be 9:30 at night and I have to come in at quarter after five in the morning.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
And every time I do, that takes me about a day and a half to recover from that.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Because I don't get to sleep right away.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Takes me forever to fall asleep.

DOCTOR X356
Well you know I think you need to make a point of at least three times a week to either show up to work early or you know stay late, depending on whether you're working late, come early and walk you know.

PATIENT X356
Yeah just take a, I could even go once around the place and it's be more than I'm doing now for crying out loud.

DOCTOR X356
Exactly.  It doesn't need to be anything big, huge.  Even if you start with you know a ten minute stroll would be.

PATIENT X356
It's getting out of bed.

DOCTOR X356
A ten minute stroll to get out of bed, that's kind of like a 20 minute stroll you know.

PATIENT X356
I know what you mean.

DOCTOR X356
So that should be uh, that should be your plan, small, small goals that have, their set and say you're gonna do it and then do it and then you can say come back and see me soon.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X356
And say DOCTOR look what I've done, I've been walking three times a week for ten minutes and I'm feeling better you know.

PATIENT X356
So instead of saying doctor I'm a lazy bum.

DOCTOR X356
Exactly.

PATIENT X356
I'm gonna say I've been walking.

DOCTOR X356
And then I'm gonna cheer for you.

PATIENT X356
There you go, I love that.  I love when someone cheers for me you know.

DOCTOR X356
I know, I do too.

PATIENT X356
Cause usually they call me the bum of the month or something like that over at work you know, no I'm just kidding you.

DOCTOR X356
(Laughter)

PATIENT X356
No I kind of, it's kind of fun we have a real fun group over there.  So you know.

DOCTOR X356
Good.

PATIENT X356
It's a dream job for most guys.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Really I mean and girls, it's really nice over there you know.  Too bad they don't pay you what a doctor gets paid cause you could work over there with us.  I'd just love to have you come.

DOCTOR X356
Oh well thank you.

PATIENT X356
You'd love that job cause you're out in the air all the time and now, three days a week I drive around in the @@@.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
Well I do get more exercise when I do that because I get out and I move around a little bit you know.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
When I'm in the shop, I'm just running up the register you know, let me have your money you know, you know what I mean.  I make change to everybody that comes and I stand there.  I don't really get nothing, yeah I'll start.  That's where we're at so, so you think everything looks pretty good there as far as my hemoglobin and all that other stuff.

DOCTOR X356
Yep.  Any blood in your stools that you see?

PATIENT X356
No, no I've been looking, no um.

DOCTOR X356
Good.

PATIENT X356
And in my urine no, uh uh.

DOCTOR X356

PATIENT X356

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
Okay.

DOCTOR X356
Yep.  So and you're on the proper meds to try and prevent any kidney disease from the diabetes, the losartan so.

PATIENT X356

PATIENT X356
Uh yeah, it was because you put me on it because my blood pressures were real high and I wasn't, you know @@@ I take two now.  I used to take one, now I'm taking two.

DOCTOR X356
Imdur to 60 maybe, I increased your uh, I increased this one and isosorbide mononitrate.

DOCTOR X356

PATIENT X356

DOCTOR X356
Okay.

PATIENT X356

I mean not that's terrible.  For now I'm now on a half a night you know.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
And my going to the bathroom is the same time as the last time.  Only when my sugar level's up do I go to the bathroom more.

DOCTOR X356
That will do it.

PATIENT X356
You know so.

DOCTOR X356
That'll do it.

PATIENT X356
@@@.  I got one little joke to tell you before I leave okay.

DOCTOR X356
Good.

PATIENT X356
Okay, um this guy is really having problems @@@ you know.  He's having sexual problems so he goes to the doctor and says at my age I shouldn't be having these problems I don't know what's the matter with me he says doctors says uh well he says what we can do here is take this jar, fill it up.  He says okay.  He says do you nee anything like uh magazines or DVDs?  He goes nope doc I'll take care of everything.  He goes away and goes home, comes back the next day.  Doctor looks at the jar nothing.  He says what happened, he says well doc he said I got home, I put the DVD in, he said I tried my right hand and nothing happened.  Tried with my left hand nothing happened.  So I called my wife and she tried with the right hand nothing, she tried with the left hand nothing happening.  I called my neighbor and she came over, tried with her right hand nothing, tried with the left hand nothing and she said.

DOCTOR X356
@@@.

PATIENT X356
And he said you called your neighbor to help you out with this?  And he said yes and she couldn't get the lid off the jar either.

DOCTOR X356
(Laughter)

PATIENT X356
Isn't that cute.

DOCTOR X356
That's great, that's great.

PATIENT X356
That you can tell your friends, a little VA humor.

DOCTOR X356

PATIENT X356
Anyway is there anything else you need from me?

DOCTOR X356
Yeah I want to retake your blood pressure.

PATIENT X356
Okay.

DOCTOR X356

DOCTOR X356
Nope, they've been working on that for quite some time.

PATIENT X356
Yeah, hello.

DOCTOR X356

On this arm, do you want to try it?

DOCTOR X356
I could try it.

PATIENT X356
Alright give it a shot.

DOCTOR X356
I usually don't have a problem.

PATIENT X356
Give it a shot.

DOCTOR X356
I might need the larger cuff though, we'll see.  Alright it was fine for me.  I gotcha about 128/74.

PATIENT X356
Oh that sounds good.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
That's probably what it should be @@@.

DOCTOR X356
It is 130/80.  Deep breath in for me good.  Alright that's good.  So one thing you are due for a tetanus shot.

PATIENT X356
I had one.

DOCTOR X356
You did?  I'll have to look again.

PATIENT X356
I'm ahead of you.

DOCTOR X356
You are, good for you.

PATIENT X356
And it hurt for about a month.  It did, it was an owie.

DOCTOR X356
I believe you, those can be terrible and you've got just a touch of swelling in your legs.

PATIENT X356
No I had, every time I come she says the same thing, a little bit not much though.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Maybe it's the @@@.

DOCTOR X356
I believe so.

PATIENT X356
No I feel good about that you know.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
I have blood so I feel good about that, it's pumping.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
You know all things being equal.

DOCTOR X356
Things are looking up right.

PATIENT X356
I couldn't ask for anything else.

DOCTOR X356
Alright.  Putting some of my paperwork in order here.  

PATIENT X356
So how have you been?

DOCTOR X356
How have I been?

PATIENT X356
Yeah.

DOCTOR X356
Been doing good, very good.

PATIENT X356
So things are going good for you as far as getting by you know.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
You're in your last year now?

DOCTOR X356
No this is my first year.

PATIENT X356
They'll go by fast.

DOCTOR X356
Two more years for me.

PATIENT X356
@@@ parade.  It's gonna be a long, I mean it's a long haul, seems like forever.  For you it must seem like forever.

DOCTOR X356
Well, yeah it can be tough but uh.

PATIENT X356
Yeah.

DOCTOR X356
So closer but I have two weeks left of work and then I have about a two week vacation before I start my next year so.

PATIENT X356
Now will you be, are you gonna be um, what do you study for?

DOCTOR X356
So I will get board certified in internal medicine by the end of this three years and I'll take a test and board certify in that.  So I'll be general internal medicine.  If I want to go on and do a specialty then I'll have to do a fellowship in that and I haven't decided.  I think I will probably just do general internal medicine, I just stay treating.

PATIENT X356
Yeah.  I mean there's a lot of GPs out there so you know.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
That ought to help you out a little bit you know what I mean.  You can get with anybody.  They're always looking for a @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
A lot of people are retiring now days, especially in Indiana.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.  @@@.  I think you know I enjoy doing a little bit of everything.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X356
Kind of taking care of the patient as a whole and just being available for whatever they need.

PATIENT X356
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X356
So.

PATIENT X356
Let me ask you this, do you have any special area you want to live in, you know like Illinois, Indiana, you know what I mean as far as where you'd want to live?

DOCTOR X356
I think I want to live in Kansas.

PATIENT X356
xxx xxx, now are you from Kansas?

DOCTOR X356
Yep.

PATIENT X356
So you want to go back home.

DOCTOR X356
I think so yeah.  In fact uh my parents live there and I have my brother and his wife and nieces and nephews.

PATIENT X356
Yeah all of your family there.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Yeah I've been through Kansas you know but never, the city itself.  I had once; I had a couple steaks there.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
That's about all I can say you know cause I stay overnight you know when I was traveling, a long time ago and uh I always liked Kansas I mean @@@ you know.  People seemed to be pretty friendly there, xxxerners.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
I would say, wouldn't you say xxxerners?

DOCTOR X356
Definitely.  That's really good.

PATIENT X356
But that's good, at least you get to go home you know.  Cause there's always something and you think, believe in the medicine field and the doctor field and all the hospitals, you should be okay.

DOCTOR X356
Yep.

PATIENT X356
@@@.

DOCTOR X356
I know.  I feel very blessed that I'll probably always be able to have a job, find a job.

PATIENT X356
Yeah.

DOCTOR X356
So tell me what is your plan for the diabetes?  When are you following up with them?

PATIENT X356
Three months.

DOCTOR X356
Three months okay, alright.  Then I don't think you necessarily need to see me in three months.

PATIENT X356
Not unless I, unless I have chest pains or something like that.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
And I will call you or go into the, if I have real bad chest pain I'll go into the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
But I'm going to, I told my cardiologist that I would uh call the doctor and let him know cause he was really concerned about it.  Cause before that, I said that blood thing must have done it, I mean that must have been cause my heart was working too hard I guess.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
For some reason.

DOCTOR X356
We call it demand ischemia so.

PATIENT X356
Okay.  If you say so.  You don't have to call it, you can call it Ray and you can call it Jay but you got to call it demand what is it?

DOCTOR X356
Demand.

PATIENT X356
Demand.

DOCTOR X356
Demand, so your heart is demanding it.

PATIENT X356
Yeah.

DOCTOR X356
And then ischemia means uh kind of like hypoxia, that it's damaging the heart because your heart is working so hard.

PATIENT X356
So I'm lucking my doctor gave @@@ everything.

DOCTOR X356
Yep, that's what it was.

PATIENT X356
Hmm.

DOCTOR X356
So I think six months would be good to see you.

PATIENT X356
Okay.

DOCTOR X356
Let me just talk with my attending and I'll be back.

PATIENT X356
Okay one thing.

DOCTOR X356
Of course.

PATIENT X356
Probably around December, when I quit, when I stop working again this year.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
That's probably when I'll probably see you.

DOCTOR X356
Okay.

PATIENT X356
Cause it doesn't make any difference between November and December, I'll make it work but if you want to put down December and then just set a date for that you know, that would work so.

DOCTOR X356
Sounds good.

PATIENT X356
Okay kiddo.

DOCTOR X356
Alright.

PATIENT X356
Sounds great doc.

DOCTOR X356
Give me just a few minutes okay.

Of course.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:45  DOCTOR IN:  45:50)

DOCTOR X356
Alright.  So do one thing, we need to look at the low platelets, have you heard that term before?  Yeah so you've been losing blood for over a year and.

PATIENT X356
What are they?

DOCTOR X356
So they're a component in your blood that helps blood clotting and they're not so low that you're at risk for bleeding or.

PATIENT X356
Well that's because I'm taking all this medication, I'm on medication for the blood pressure medication.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
It's a blood thinner, I'm taking all this crap @@@ its working.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
Which is gonna lead me to have whatever the hell it is.  I know that I bleed, I bleed @@@ you know than I used to.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
You know and uh now what do we want to do with that?

DOCTOR X356
So there are some lab studies we could do and then send you to a hematologist or specialist which is a blood specialist.

PATIENT X356
For?  But that means I have to pay money for that though.  If it's not important do you think I need to go I mean yet?

DOCTOR X356
So.

PATIENT X356
Could we wait till next time to see where I'm at?  I mean I'm sure they're not going to be real worse.  I mean higher.  I'm sure I'm not going to increase any but I don't.

DOCTOR X356
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X356
Really want to go at this time with my financial situation because I have to pay now.  I have to pay uh so much per visit.

DOCTOR X356
Yeah.

PATIENT X356
And in some ways, I don't have insurance.  I mean you know that's one thing cause I'm seeing four doctors now.

DOCTOR X356
I know.  That's a lot.

PATIENT X356
Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know what to do I mean.  Now what else is there, what else is this thing, the platelets are what is it, I'm low on platelets or?

DOCTOR X356
Yep low platelets.

PATIENT X356
I got nothing on my plate, what is this?

DOCTOR X356
So low platelets and you know I would expect you to bleed more because you're on the medicines but even being on these medicines the platelets are lower than what I.

PATIENT X356
What are they supposed to be?

DOCTOR X356
So greater than 150.

PATIENT X356
I can't see what they were.

DOCTOR X356
You're at 62.

PATIENT X356
Okay.

DOCTOR X356

PATIENT X356

DOCTOR X356
October 2009.

PATIENT X356

DOCTOR X356
So because I don't know the cause is why I'm sending, you know recommending that you go see.

PATIENT X356

DOCTOR X356

PATIENT X356

DOCTOR X356

DOCTOR X356

PATIENT X356
And then what else do you want me to do?  What's the other thing?

DOCTOR X356
Um if you're open for getting lab work or if you want to wait on the lab work I would be more amenable to that.

PATIENT X356
He says Father; forgive me Father for I have sinned.  Father says what's the matter my son?  He said well Father he says I've had illicit relationships with a member of our church.  He goes you have son.  Yes I have.  He goes do I happen to know this young lady is it?  And he goes yes.  He goes excuse me Father you do know her.  He goes you care to tell me who it is?  And he goes no; I don't want to tell you who it is.  You know it would be a sin, but I don't want take my confession back but I don't think it's relevant because.  He says well in a way it is I mean you know.  Well let me just say this, could it be a person named xxx and he goes no.  I can't tell you Father.  He says how about xxx.  No, how about Sue?  No.  @@@ the names of two more girls right.  He goes no @@@.  He goes well I'll tell you here's your penitence.  I want you to say 40 Hail xxx's, 40 our Father's and because you have really sinned I want you to have four months off from the altar, you cannot be an altar boy.  Father I, no my son that's my final, you cannot be an altar boy for four months.  Okay, so he goes up the stairs and all the guys are standing out waiting for him to come on out because he was taking up and they go what happened.  Well the bad news is I have to say 40 hail xxx's and 40 our Father's.  The good news is I get four months vacation and I have five new leads.

PATIENT X21
Good, good.

DOCTOR X21
I tried calling you a couple weeks ago, to try to let you know about um the study that you had at xxx Brown.

PATIENT X21
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X21
Well I guess, I couldn't get an answer.

PATIENT X21
When did you call?

DOCTOR X21
Um, last week sometime.

PATIENT X21
@@@.

DOCTOR X21
Oh okay.  Yeah it was uh the 2nd.

PATIENT X21
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X21
Last week.  Um, so what they saw on the study was that they didn't, they didn't see any source of bleeding at all.

PATIENT X21
Oh.

DOCTOR X21
With the scan and no, nothing that, I think from their notes it was a little bit of a bad prep, meaning you weren't totally clean.

PATIENT X21
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X21
So they couldn't see everything um but you know the whole reason that we were doing it was because your hemoglobin, cause your red blood cell count was low.

PATIENT X21
Yeah.

DOCTOR X21
And we thought maybe you were bleeding from somewhere.

PATIENT X21
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X21
But the most recent labs we have look great.

PATIENT X21
Yeah.

DOCTOR X21
So I don't think that we need anything else more done, we'll just keep watching it.

PATIENT X21
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X21
To make sure you don't go down again.  Um and if, you know if that starts to happen again then we could probably get the study done again.

PATIENT X21
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X21
So that's good news.

PATIENT X21

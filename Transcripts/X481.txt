DOCTOR X481

DOCTOR X481

PATIENT X481
My hip is.  How are you today?

DOCTOR X481
Good how are you?  Fair enough.  @@@.

PATIENT X481
Sure. 

DOCTOR X481
How are you doing?

PATIENT X481
Oh pretty good I think.

SECOND PERSON X481
How are you today?

DOCTOR X481
Uh I'm actually doing pretty good myself.  Getting kind of tired but.

SECOND PERSON X481
Yeah.

PATIENT X481
I think I'm pretty good cause I'm still breathing.

DOCTOR X481
I saw you saw the Hematology doctors.

PATIENT X481
The what?

DOCTOR X481
The doctors about your blood.

PATIENT X481
Yeah I saw them.  I just had the blood drawn today.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah know let's take a look at that.

PATIENT X481
Yeah I just had it.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.

PATIENT X481
I just had it drawn uh about 12:30.

DOCTOR X481
About 12:30 so it probably won't come back till a little bit later.  Right and how have your blood sugars been at home?

PATIENT X481
Blood sugar, it was 137 today, it's been pretty good.

DOCTOR X481
So you're checking every day?

PATIENT X481
Yes.

DOCTOR X481
What time do you check it?

PATIENT X481
Uh this morning.  You got uh, I wake up late.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.  I'm just going to be typing as we talk okay.

PATIENT X481
Okay I wake up late so it varies because I stay up late.  Uh most of the time it'd be around 2 o'clock when I take it.

DOCTOR X481
Is this after you've eaten something?

PATIENT X481
Uh only coffee.

DOCTOR X481
So only after coffee?

PATIENT X481
Right uh-huh, after I've had my cup of coffee.

DOCTOR X481
Do you have any low sugars?

PATIENT X481
No it's never low.

DOCTOR X481
What's it range from?

PATIENT X481
It ranges between 100 and sometimes it'll get up around 190.

DOCTOR X481
Okay that's the highest it goes?

PATIENT X481
Yeah that's about as high as it goes.

DOCTOR X481
Okay because you're hemoglobin A1c which is the measure of how controlled your blood sugars are, when we checked it the last time it was a little bit elevated.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
So uh I think we're gonna have to probably go up on your medicine.

PATIENT X481
Again?

DOCTOR X481
Yeah because well let's see, so I saw you back in February, oh no you know because I think I had seen you back in October.

PATIENT X481
I seen a letter about the.

DOCTOR X481
You saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT X481
I saw DOCTOR then I saw someone else too.

DOCTOR X481
The blood doctor right?

PATIENT X481
Right and I saw them yeah.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah so we had cut back on it but we need to go up on it.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
Um back in October.

PATIENT X481
Yeah.

DOCTOR X481
And you're on 40 units right?

PATIENT X481
Right that's the same amount I'm taking now, 40.

DOCTOR X481
You were supposed to go up to 45.

PATIENT X481
Uh no.

DOCTOR X481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X481
But okay.

DOCTOR X481
How do you feel about that?

PATIENT X481
Well if you think its necessary I mean.

DOCTOR X481
The only thing is as long as your blood sugars aren't running low.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
On either number.

PATIENT X481
They're never running low.

DOCTOR X481
Never lower than 100?

PATIENT X481
The only time is if I miss a meal, then I run low.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
But generally they never run low.

DOCTOR X481
Alright.

PATIENT X481
Okay.

DOCTOR X481
So if that's the case then we'll go up a little bit more.

PATIENT X481
Okay.  I was thinking all along, I probably shouldn't have waited.

DOCTOR X481
I know.

PATIENT X481
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X481
He was just high.

DOCTOR X481
So you know we want the goal of your A1c below 7.  Yours is @@@.

SECOND PERSON X481
That's the same as was back then.

PATIENT X481
I thought, well what was it last time?

DOCTOR X481
Before it was @@@ 7. something.

PATIENT X481
It was 7 @@@.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.  Now it will happen, it could be that your eating habits have changed but elevated or not @@@ little bit more @@@.

PATIENT X481
But it could be so if I'm not getting along as well since it's been cold.

DOCTOR X481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X481
And when it's cold my hip is bothering me and I don't move as much as when it's warm.

DOCTOR X481
So why don't we go up by 5 units.  If you start getting anything below 100.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
Then you just cut it down to just say 43 units.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
Uh but keep it in the 40s and then if, like I said, if you do it at 45, if you suddenly have lower readings below 100.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
Then cut it back down so it would be 43 units.  If you're still getting low readings then cut it down to 40.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
Yeah, I just have to bring it back down if it's low, I get it okay.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.

PATIENT X481
Right, okay.

DOCTOR X481
And um this.

PATIENT X481
There's something I need to see, it's one of the things I need you to see.

DOCTOR X481
Oh okay.

PATIENT X481
They wanted me to see @@@ doctor.  It's about my vitamin D.

DOCTOR X481
Oh you're vitamin D levels?

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
Let's see.  Yeah so this is actually pretty low.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And we can actually; we can probably set you up for a supplementation for your vitamin D.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And it's one pill that you'll take every week.

PATIENT X481
It's once a day?

DOCTOR X481
It's once a week.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X481
And you'll take it for about you know three months.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And then we'll recheck your levels.

PATIENT X481
Okay.

DOCTOR X481
Okay, let me see.  Oh this is from last year.

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
Do you take any vitamin D supplements or did they give you anything?

PATIENT X481
No they didn't give me anything.  They placed me on that, I know the last time I was in, they forgot to give it to me, DOCTOR when I saw DOCTOR and uh but I told him that I was going to go back on it so to get it for me.

DOCTOR X481
Okay, well yeah last time you didn't get started taking anything so it's probably still low.

PATIENT X481
Right and tell me what does that vitamin D do?

DOCTOR X481
Well it actually helps; the higher your vitamin D is the better it is for your bones.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And uh the lower your vitamin D, there is the risk of when you fall of having your bones break.

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah so.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.  Then let's um.

DOCTOR X481
And how's your breathing been?

PATIENT X481
Breathing is about the same. 

DOCTOR X481
About the same.

PATIENT X481
It's still bad.  I get out of breath easily.

DOCTOR X481
So you haven't been using the CPAP?

PATIENT X481
The CPAP, what is that?

DOCTOR X481
The CPAP do you use that?

PATIENT X481
If you mean the breathing machine?

DOCTOR X481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X481
I don't have a breathing machine; I have a sleep apnea machine.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah that's what I meant by it.

PATIENT X481
Hmm.

DOCTOR X481
Do you use it?

PATIENT X481
Hmm sometimes, not like I should.

DOCTOR X481
How come?

PATIENT X481
It's uncomfortable, I'm scared of it.

DOCTOR X481
You could maybe try to get it re-fitted.

PATIENT X481
Okay.

DOCTOR X481
So maybe that's why it's, because it's uncomfortable for you.

PATIENT X481
Hmm, we tried uh you know the stick in your nose.

DOCTOR X481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X481
Tried that and then we tried the mask and it still.

DOCTOR X481
Still uncomfortable.

PATIENT X481
Still uncomfortable.  I'm going to, what I'm gonna do is start using it regularly and uh see how if I can get used to it.  If I can just get used to it being on my face.  I'm not used to anything covering my nose and face so I'm gonna try it and see how that works.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X481
Um, is it true that they had found something new uh that you don't have to use the mask?

DOCTOR X481
For the CPAP?

SECOND PERSON X481
Uh for the CPAP treatment.

DOCTOR X481
No, do you know what um.

SECOND PERSON X481
Somewhere I saw or heard about it on the TV or something.  It's a medication I think instead of the machine.

DOCTOR X481
Hmm for sleep apnea, not that I know of.

SECOND PERSON X481
Well maybe it's not, maybe it's new.

DOCTOR X481
Because you know the reason why the medication is not @@@.  So I don't know, I don't think there's any medications that actually replace it.  @@@.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X481
Well you, it's probably not just kind of pills, sometimes he gets aggravated with me because I wake him up.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.  And the other problem is the longer you don't use the CPAP the higher your risk of developing high blood pressure of the arteries of your lungs.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And that can be very dangerous.

PATIENT X481
Yes.

DOCTOR X481
Uh and that's why it's really important for you to.

PATIENT X481
To use that machine.

SECOND PERSON X481
So what do you mean about high blood pressure from the arteries of your lungs?

DOCTOR X481
Uh you can, just probably over time and you develop what's called pulmonary hypertension.

SECOND PERSON X481
Oh.

DOCTOR X481
And that uh.

PATIENT X481
What you say, that means what?

DOCTOR X481
Like how you have high blood pressure of, we give medication for, for your arteries.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh @@@.

DOCTOR X481
No you can actually get that of the blood vessels of your lungs, uh the blood of your heart that kind of leads to your lungs.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X481
And um and that's much harder to treat.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.

SECOND PERSON X481
But it is treatable?

DOCTOR X481
Well not really.

SECOND PERSON X481
Not successfully?

DOCTOR X481
Uh sometimes if your blood pressure is so high you can be on home oxygen.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh @@@.

SECOND PERSON X481
What is a really dangerous blood pressure?

DOCTOR X481
Uh for the lungs?

SECOND PERSON X481
For anything.

DOCTOR X481
Well I mean, usually our goal blood pressures for you, when you come in here and we want your blood pressure to be about 130/80.

PATIENT X481
Hmm.  Well today my blood pressure was 112/73.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah actually that's good.

PATIENT X481
So I could take off, stay on my blood pressure medicines?

DOCTOR X481
Yeah that's actually great; it's good that you should stay there.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay, alright.  Cause I thought it was too low.

DOCTOR X481
No it's actually normal.  Less than 120/80 is normal.

PATIENT X481
Oh is that, okay.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah so.  Um do you need any refills today?

PATIENT X481
Yes I do.  I need refills on um uh all of my uh, like the insulin, the insulin uh the syringes I don't have any refills on the syringes and my testing strips.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X481
Nothing else?

PATIENT X481
Yeah I have a little more and my uh I need a refill on the Cialis.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.  Anything else?

PATIENT X481
That's all.  Cause I have refills on the rest of them.  DOCTOR gave me refills on most of them the last time.

SECOND PERSON X481
Last time you were here?

PATIENT X481
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X481
Okay.

DOCTOR X481
So do you want to get those, pick them up while you're here?

PATIENT X481
Uh you can have them mailed to me.

DOCTOR X481
Mailed to you.

PATIENT X481
Cause I have enough to last me for a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.  Let me have you sit down so we can listen to you.

PATIENT X481
Do you need me to take my coat off?

DOCTOR X481
Yes.

PATIENT X481
Okay.  Oh you know something else, I almost forgot, my um my right leg it keeps swelling up.

DOCTOR X481
When?

PATIENT X481
Oh this last week it swelled up, it's about every day.  I don't know if something's cutting off my circulation or what.

DOCTOR X481
So do you have any pain when you walk?

PATIENT X481
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X481
In your legs?

PATIENT X481
Yes uh, @@@ you know I need a hip replacement and I don't want to do that but the swelling, that shouldn't cause the swelling though right?

DOCTOR X481
So, do you try putting your feet up?  Have you been on your feet a lot?

PATIENT X481
Well I'm not on it a whole lot but uh.

DOCTOR X481
I'm gonna have you um roll up your pants.

PATIENT X481
See I think uh it's swelled right now.

DOCTOR X481
So let me see the other one too.  And it kind of swells up then goes down?

PATIENT X481
It swells up and then it, both of them are swelling now.

SECOND PERSON X481
But I know your feet have swelled for the last.

PATIENT X481
Yeah the swelling in my leg.

SECOND PERSON X481
Your right leg.

PATIENT X481
Yeah it's mostly the right one.

SECOND PERSON X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
@@@.

PATIENT X481
@@@.

DOCTOR X481
I'll press it.  

SECOND PERSON X481
You want them both up?

DOCTOR X481
Yes and do you take a water pill at all?

PATIENT X481
Yes I take that for my blood pressure.  I think that's what blood.

SECOND PERSON X481
Yeah it's a water pill for your blood pressure.

PATIENT X481
She wants the sock off too?

SECOND PERSON X481
Do you want the sock off?

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT X481
@@@ socks.

SECOND PERSON X481
It's swollen.

DOCTOR X481
And you didn't hurt yourself?

PATIENT X481
Not that I know of.  They just, I was watching TV.

DOCTOR X481
And how often do you get this?

PATIENT X481
Well, looks like all last week it's been swelling.

DOCTOR X481
And then the swelling goes down?

PATIENT X481
When I lay down and wake up it goes down.  But when I'm up and moving around it swells up.

DOCTOR X481
So one of the things that um.

SECOND PERSON X481
She wants this up.

DOCTOR X481
Is it right here?

PATIENT X481
Right in there, where you just had.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.  And you didn't hurt yourself right?

PATIENT X481
No I don't remember.

SECOND PERSON X481
No.

PATIENT X481
No I don't feel any real pain in it.

DOCTOR X481
So why don't you, it this okay when I'm pressing?

PATIENT X481
It's okay.

DOCTOR X481
It's okay.

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
Can you move your ankle for me, there's no pain there?

PATIENT X481
No it's, that's the way it was.

SECOND PERSON X481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X481
I'm just thinking it had something to do with the circulation or something.

DOCTOR X481
Well you know I think they tested your circulation when you were in Podiatry.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And the circulation of blood to your legs is okay.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
Uh.

PATIENT X481
But there's got to be something for it to swell up like that.  We'll let you know, next time it swell up maybe I take a picture of it and let you see.

SECOND PERSON X481
That one is swollen now.

PATIENT X481
Well this one is @@@.

DOCTOR X481
So it looks like your ankle here is swollen here.

SECOND PERSON X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
So.

PATIENT X481
I don't know.

DOCTOR X481
It could just be cause this is your bad hip right?

PATIENT X481
It is.

DOCTOR X481
So that you might actually be um using your, to compensate for your hip.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
You might be putting more pressure on your.

PATIENT X481
Yeah I do do that.

DOCTOR X481
On the joints and that would cause you swelling.  It's, I don't think it's anything to be worried about right now.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
But the thing is if it gets swollen and it stays swollen.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And it becomes red and hot uh that's when we need to think about there's maybe clot in your leg or if you have an infection in your leg.

PATIENT X481
Alright.

DOCTOR X481
That doesn't seem to be the case.

PATIENT X481
Well then at night if I lay down, if I go to sleep when I wake up then it's down.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah that's another thing too is you could be putting a lot of pressure on that.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
But you're gonna naturally have a little bit more swelling.

PATIENT X481
Should I just, kind of keep @@@.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.

PATIENT X481
@@@.

DOCTOR X481
Let me just listen to you okay.  

PATIENT X481
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
Yeah.

DOCTOR X481
Deep breaths, another one.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT X481
Yes I do.

DOCTOR X481
Are you going to quit smoking soon?

PATIENT X481
Well I'm trying, I'm trying.

DOCTOR X481
Are you really trying?

PATIENT X481
Not real real hard uh.

DOCTOR X481
Because you've got some wheezing.

PATIENT X481
Hmm.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X481
@@@.

DOCTOR X481
So you've got to stop smoking.

PATIENT X481
Right I know.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.  

PATIENT X481
I know all my doctors tell me.

SECOND PERSON X481
He's got to @@@ trying.

PATIENT X481
All of my doctors tell me.

SECOND PERSON X481
He's @@@.

DOCTOR X481
I just need to talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:24  DOCTOR IN:  27:50)

DOCTOR X481
Okay.  So I talked to DOCTOR.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
And he actually recommends going up on your insulin to 50 units.

PATIENT X481
50?

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.  But you know cause it's up to you if you feel comfortable going up that many units.

PATIENT X481
Well if he thinks it's best I'll do it.

DOCTOR X481
And then if blood sugars ever run low then you should.

PATIENT X481
Then cut back.

DOCTOR X481
Um cut back and then call here.

PATIENT X481
Okay.

DOCTOR X481
Okay and let him know.

PATIENT X481
Alright uh so a lot of times that if I call then I don't get through.

DOCTOR X481
I think sometimes they tell you to go to the Urgent Care.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
I don't know when DOCTOR is available here.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.  Yeah I know he's got a lot of patients.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah.

PATIENT X481
Oh.  So I it would probably be better just to call at his old clinic and ask for him?

DOCTOR X481
Yeah that's probably the best way.

PATIENT X481
Just call okay.  Uh one more thing I wanted to ask you and then uh you know a couple things, you send in for my syringes and stuff, you ordered those for me right?

DOCTOR X481
I'm going, yeah I'm actually ordering them right now.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
But we're going to have the come to you through the mail.

PATIENT X481
Yeah that's the syringes, the test strips and the insulin.

DOCTOR X481

PATIENT X481
Okay.  And the Cialis I need a refill on that.

DOCTOR X481

PATIENT X481
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
Alright.

DOCTOR X481
And then we'll see you back here in about two months.

PATIENT X481
That's what I was wanting to ask you, not to schedule any appointments till after May.

DOCTOR X481
Oh that's.

PATIENT X481
Because my granddaughter is going to school.

DOCTOR X481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X481
And she needs somebody to keep her baby.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
She had to miss today because I had to come, but I had to come, I need the supplies and stuff.

DOCTOR X481
Okay.

PATIENT X481
Uh and I want to ask you one more question and then I'll be out of here.

DOCTOR X481
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X481
Uh if you were to tell me that uh I need, my activities were restricted to control my blood sugar what would you be telling me?

DOCTOR X481
What makes you think you uh restrict your activities?

PATIENT X481
I'm not under that?

DOCTOR X481
Uh uh.

PATIENT X481
No restrictions, I see.

DOCTOR X481
No you should actually try to walk around as much as you can.

PATIENT X481
Oh okay, that's what I was just @@@.

DOCTOR X481
Okay and this is the sheet you gave me earlier about the vitamin D levels.

SECOND PERSON X481
Well what about the shortness of his breath?

DOCTOR X481
So as much as you can tolerate.

SECOND PERSON X481
But um he gets out of breath quick.

DOCTOR X481
Yeah so the thing is that that we actually don't have any control over because part of it's his COPD.

SECOND PERSON X481
When they gonna check his lungs?

DOCTOR X481
Uh check his lungs for?

SECOND PERSON X481
You know @@@.

PATIENT X481

PATIENT X481
But I didn't go back for that appointment.

SECOND PERSON X481
But you should.

PATIENT X481
But there wasn't no need in going back until I quit smoking.

DOCTOR X481
So.

PATIENT X481
Cause she said basically is my problem is smoking.

DOCTOR X481
The problem is smoking.

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
And it's only gonna get worse.

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
So what I recommend is for you to, I mean.

PATIENT X481
Right, I'm gonna stop smoking.

DOCTOR X481
Stop smoking, start using a breathing machine and then you're gonna start feeling much better.  You're gonna be able to walk further, you'll be less short of breath.

PATIENT X481
We have uh, once I quit smoking will my lungs clear up then or?

DOCTOR X481
It takes a, it'll take a while.  A lot damage has been done to your lungs.

PATIENT X481
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X481
Can't be reversed.

PATIENT X481
Right.

DOCTOR X481
But at least you won't damage it any further.

PATIENT X481

DOCTOR X481
The damage should stop.

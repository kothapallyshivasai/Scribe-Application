DOCTOR X482
Good to see you.

PATIENT X482
Isn't that cool?

DOCTOR X482
Are they @@@ you?  Okay.  How are things going?

PATIENT X482
Uh pretty good, pretty good.

DOCTOR X482
Okay um so you're that heart test that you did was normal.  The one where they, it was done at the @@@

PATIENT X482
The echogram?

DOCTOR X482
Yeah.

PATIENT X482
That echogram.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah.

PATIENT X482
Yeah @@@ wanted to ask you @@@ his heart.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah.

PATIENT X482
So I got a pretty good heart and you know that's, you know I have a good heart @@@ muscle.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah.

PATIENT X482
Gets the blood everywhere.

DOCTOR X482
@@@ sure.  Any problems since I last saw you?

PATIENT X482
Uh no not really.  You know but one thing I'm really concerned about and @@@ I take my blood pressure at home @@@.

DOCTOR X482
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X482
And sometime my heart race, it's up to like 52, is that kind of too low or?

DOCTOR X482
Well if you have any symptoms from it?  In terms of do you feel lightheaded at all?

PATIENT X482
No, no, I don't think so.

DOCTOR X482
Okay.  Um any.

PATIENT X482
But you know, I know you can look at my records uh in February I spent a couple of days in the hospital here because I did pass out.

DOCTOR X482
Right yeah.

PATIENT X482
But I think they agreed with me like I just got overheated.  I told them I got real hot and I just stopped and sat down and the next thing I know they @@@ somebody and uh they said I was out for maybe a minute, not even a minute, you know just half a minute so.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah there's lots of reasons why you can um be, why you can pass out.  Sometimes it's you're heart but it's not always.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
So I would say, you know there was one time you were here when it was reported in the 50s but it looks like you're consistently you know in the 60s or 70s which is actually good.  It means the medication's working.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
That's what we want to see because the atenolol, that medication you're on protects your heart a little bit.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
So um.

PATIENT X482
Well I'm like on a half a tablet only right now.

DOCTOR X482
I know yeah and you're on a small dose, that's right.

PATIENT X482
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X482
So I would say just continue.  You know if it were to recur again then we'll look at and when it does happen.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
If at that time your heart rate is low then we would consider stopping it but I think.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
When it happens your heart rate wasn't that low so it means that it wasn't that low.

PATIENT X482
Okay, that's good, that's really good.

DOCTOR X482
@@@.  Um so the other thing I'm going to send you vitamin D pills.

PATIENT X482
Oh yeah, I've had was on that for a long time but you know I just bought some and so I taking them, I think @@@ 800 units. 

DOCTOR X482
Oh you do.

PATIENT X482
Something like that.

DOCTOR X482
Okay.

PATIENT X482
@@@.

DOCTOR X482
Is it cheaper for you to buy them?

PATIENT X482
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X482
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X482
I get 400 in a bottle @@@.

DOCTOR X482
Okay so what I want you to do is um stop, I'm going to send these other, these concentrated pills uh just cause your level was borderline low so to get your numbers back into the normal range.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X482
And then we'll and then you could, so don't throw those pills that you have away.

PATIENT X482
Alright.

DOCTOR X482
But I'll these send you these and you just take it once a week.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X482

PATIENT X482
Don't take it with the other ones.

DOCTOR X482
Right just hold, put those aside for three months.

PATIENT X482
Okay.

DOCTOR X482
And then once you're done taking these once a week for 12 weeks.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X482
Then start taking those.

PATIENT X482
Okay.

DOCTOR X482
Okay and it should, you know now that's it's sunny outside that'll help you.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
Help you.  I think all people who @@@.

PATIENT X482

DOCTOR X482
Um and otherwise no changes to any of your medications I think.  Your blood pressure looks good.  Your cholesterol is still at goal um.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
And then urology you don't have an appointment until October right?

PATIENT X482
I don't know.  It's like once a year.  I don't know, they said they'd call me.  It's only like a once a year basis now.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah they say in October and @@@.

PATIENT X482
They wouldn't call me back until when, October?

DOCTOR X482

PATIENT X482

PATIENT X482
This time they did find some polyps the first time but you know they wasn't any.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah and they take then out right then.

PATIENT X482
Right.

DOCTOR X482
So it's just the, yeah I don't know let me just make sure that there's no other.  We just checked your blood so I don't think there's anything for me to look at but hmm.  Do you have any questions for me?

PATIENT X482
Yes.  Well I have a question; I have something I would like for you to do for me.

DOCTOR X482
Sure.

PATIENT X482
I have to renew my handicapped sticker.  I have it because I have these operated knees and when I have to walk a long time, a long distance, it's like I'm only doing my walking in the day so I got a knee brace on to help me get up.  Uh it expired yesterday but I had, last time I was here I had the doctor fill out the form for me.  The Secretary of State wouldn't accept it because uh he put over here one year.

DOCTOR X482
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X482
See it's either permanent or six months and I have a permanent one.

DOCTOR X482
Do you have a new form or can I just @@@.

PATIENT X482
No, no, no.  They wouldn't let me change that.

DOCTOR X482
Okay.

PATIENT X482
So I got a new form, see I got already had a permanent when they did the @@@.

DOCTOR X482
Oh okay.

PATIENT X482
And uh I got a new form.

DOCTOR X482
Oh yeah let's do this one cause.

PATIENT X482
And they have to be filled out and they wouldn't accept this one because he put one year in there and I said what, I just is that what he said, probably just @@@.  And I @@@ handicapped @@@.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah.

PATIENT X482
You got to do all of this stuff and I see this was expired yesterday and I don't want to be getting no ticket for it.

DOCTOR X482
What did we put on the old one?

PATIENT X482
It's up here knee osteoarthritis is what they put.  Uh I don't know that it's terrible, I see that date of birth up here.  

DOCTOR X482
Oh sure.

PATIENT X482
Does it call for that?  

DOCTOR X482
This one is.

PATIENT X482
The one that says now that's what disability, that's why I come here, I say did something that isn't right.

DOCTOR X482
Yep.

PATIENT X482
Yeah but that's why we'll get this right.

DOCTOR X482
What's this on the bottom here?  Down here.

PATIENT X482
Yeah.  Oh.

DOCTOR X482
Now DOCTOR isn't here any more.

PATIENT X482
Oh.

DOCTOR X482
Did she tell you?

PATIENT X482
Uh no, no.

DOCTOR X482
There's somebody who replaced her and her name is DOCTOR.  @@@.

PATIENT X482
Okay.

DOCTOR X482
We'll look at um okay.  This one.

PATIENT X482
@@@.

DOCTOR X482
I'll have her fill this one out.

PATIENT X482
Alrighty.

DOCTOR X482
@@@.  Otherwise it looks like you're in good shape.

PATIENT X482
Alright.  @@@.

DOCTOR X482
Just sit up here for me, I'm gonna take a look at you.  Anything else I can do for you @@@.

PATIENT X482
No I think that's about it.

DOCTOR X482
Okay.  

PATIENT X482
You know it took a long time cause I had a 10 o'clock appointment and @@@ could have done you know at least 30 minutes after my appointment now and I'm usually in and out.

DOCTOR X482
They told me they checked you in.  They had here you were at 10:30.

PATIENT X482
Oh.

DOCTOR X482
When I came to look for you um and I couldn't find your @@@ they had the paperwork and then it disappeared and so.

PATIENT X482
Yeah okay, I talked to two people out there and try to you know, like this guy with the heart thing and then talked to him.

DOCTOR X482
Oh okay.

PATIENT X482
So maybe.

DOCTOR X482
Yes.

PATIENT X482
Maybe they pulled my papers while I'm talking with them or something I don't know.

DOCTOR X482
I think that's the problem cause I know you showed up early.

PATIENT X482
Oh yeah I was here long before 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR X482
And you were yeah.

PATIENT X482
Always, I'm always early.

DOCTOR X482
And maybe they took it yeah.  So that's.  Few deep breaths for me.  One more.  You sound good.  

PATIENT X482
Okay.  Did I mention to you, I did mention to you about that low heart rate I get sometimes at home right?

DOCTOR X482
Yep.

PATIENT X482
But you said that's nothing to worry about huh?

DOCTOR X482
But if you feel, if @@@ does happen. 

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X482
Then um I would say you could just hold off on your atenolol.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X482
For a few days and see if it helps you.

PATIENT X482
I'll see.

DOCTOR X482
And you can always come back to Urgent Care.

PATIENT X482
Yeah, I'll keep checking it then.

DOCTOR X482
But yeah.  I'd say the best thing to do is take it, if you want to check it, take it first thing in the morning but you're on a small dose and your blood pressure is otherwise controlled so it's helping protect your heart a little bit but it you know, it you check it and it's low then you can stop it.

PATIENT X482
Okay.

DOCTOR X482
Uh I'll check it and if it's low.

PATIENT X482
I always check it first thing in the morning.

DOCTOR X482
Okay.

PATIENT X482
Right before I eat.

DOCTOR X482
Okay.  Um yeah if you have no other problems I'll see you back in four months.

PATIENT X482
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR X482
Yeah but let me go have DOCTOR.

PATIENT X482
Oh oh, okay yeah.

DOCTOR X482
@@@ so she can have those @@@.  So I'll see you in August.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay good.

DOCTOR X482
Three months.

PATIENT X482
Good.

DOCTOR X482
About a week before you um, like a few days before the next appointment, come to the Lab and get your blood drawn and we'll check to make sure that vitamin D has been replaced.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X482
Uh and we'll have to check it.

PATIENT X482
Uh and when I come to the Lab for that, I'm probably not going to be in the computer or anything.   I just go in there and I don't have to be right?

DOCTOR X482
Yes I'm putting in the computer right now.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X482
For um August.

PATIENT X482
Okay.

DOCTOR X482

Okay.  DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR X482
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X482
DOCTOR okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X482
Okay take care.

PATIENT X482
Okay, sure will.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Thank you.  Okay, so um I'm going to write your cholesterol numbers down so you have them on this paper.

PATIENT X482
Okay, the what now?

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Your cholesterol numbers, would you like to have them?

PATIENT X482
Yeah, do that, yeah, yeah that's a good idea.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Okay this is a list of all your medications that you're on right now anyway so we'll just give you and um so all of your numbers look good.  So your total, @@@ total cholesterol.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Um HDL is the good cholesterol.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
And remember H is for healthy.

PATIENT X482
Yeah okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
And it looks like you're 149 and then your LDL remember L for lethal, is your bad cholesterol.

PATIENT X482
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Is 67 and so we want, so to meet your goal less than 200 you want this about 40, this one less than 150 and this is less than 70.

PATIENT X482
Above 40?

FIRST DOCTOR X482
So right, so there's no medication.  Well there is a medication that can raise it but the other thing that can raise it is doing exercise.

PATIENT X482
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
So either walking or riding a bike or something.

PATIENT X482
Kind like kills the walking.  Cause my wife gets up at 6 o'clock every morning and goes for a walk, oh maybe about a mile, mile and a half, with my neighbor.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Okay.

PATIENT X482
And I'm going to go @@@ but I drop out about half a block.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Oh right.  Now can you do swimming or biking?

PATIENT X482
Uh a stationary bike.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Yeah.  So if you just do it you know for about 20 or 30 minutes, enough to break a sweat.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
You don't have to be stressing.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
But you need to do that @@@ and that'll help raise it.

PATIENT X482
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
But this number is everything else looks good so I wouldn't say that this is low enough and these other numbers are not abnormal so I wouldn't.

PATIENT X482
Okay that should be up in the 70s?

FIRST DOCTOR X482
40s.

PATIENT X482
Oh show I should go, I was looking at that @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
That means greater.  Greater than and less than.

PATIENT X482
Okay.  Okay, @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
So it's not low enough because @@@ I would put you on another medication.

PATIENT X482
Uh-huh.  I'll see if I couldn't get it up by the next time I get here.

FIRST DOCTOR X482
Okay.

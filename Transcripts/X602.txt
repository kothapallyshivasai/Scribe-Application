On your leg.

PATIENT X602
Right, right.

DOCTOR X602
Did you never have to see a doctor before all this happened?

DOCTOR X602
Yeah, yeah.  So you just never had a reason to go to the doctor.

PATIENT X602
Right, right.

DOCTOR X602
You were in good health and then all of a sudden this happened.

PATIENT X602
Right, right.

DOCTOR X602
And I understand that they had to cut below your knee on this one and just your toes on this leg right.

PATIENT X602
Right, right.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.  Did they tell you the reason why they thought this happened?

PATIENT X602
It was just frost bitten.

PATIENT X602
I don't know how it happened.

DOCTOR X602
Were you out in the cold during the blizzard?

PATIENT X602
I was cold; I was out in the cold.

DOCTOR X602
Yeah.  Goodness.  So it's not because you have like diabetes or?

PATIENT X602
Oh no, no, no, no.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.

PATIENT X602
Hmm.

DOCTOR X602
Alright, so according to the computer though you have a lot of medicines they want you to take.  Are you taking those?

PATIENT X602
@@@, I take them right, right.

DOCTOR X602
You do those.  Okay cause you have some blood pressure medicines so it looks like maybe you did have high blood pressure.

PATIENT X602
Well I thought I did cause you know I knew if I had it, I knew if I'd feel dizzy when I'd be walking.

DOCTOR X602
Oh.

PATIENT X602
I'd feel a little dizzy but after a while, cause I quit what I was doing and it'd go away.

DOCTOR X602

DOCTOR X602
A pack about every day and a half okay, alright.  Um any other problems you're having besides with your legs.  Because with your legs I can't help you unfortunately.  You've got to get Podiatry to help you.

PATIENT X602
Hmm.

DOCTOR X602
Nothing, no problem, no problems with your medicines or anything?

PATIENT X602
No problems, no medicines.

DOCTOR X602
It looks like you're gonna run out of stuff soon.

PATIENT X602
Yeah I ran out of one already.  I @@@.

DOCTOR X602
You did alright.  Amlodipine.  Are you needing this diphenhydramine, that's the xxxadryl?  I don't know, were you taking it for itching or for sleeping?

PATIENT X602
No I don't take nothing like that.

DOCTOR X602
Okay so you don't need that one right here.

PATIENT X602
Yeah.

DOCTOR X602
Um.  They have you on iron supplements, was your iron low, do you know?

PATIENT X602
Yeah I was gonna ask you if you know, but I'm taking two iron supplements.

DOCTOR X602
Yeah.  Let me see how they were. 

PATIENT X602
One of them I still have quite a few but the other one's kind of low.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.

PATIENT X602
Yeah.

DOCTOR X602
Let me see what they put you on.  Maybe they want you to have it.

PATIENT X602
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X602
Oh your hemoglobin is very low, that's your blood count, okay.  And when you take the iron are you having problems with constipation at all?

PATIENT X602
No, not at all.

DOCTOR X602
No okay.

PATIENT X602
I don't take the @@@ any more.

DOCTOR X602
The oh you don't take the stool softeners anymore?

PATIENT X602
No, they make me keeping running.

DOCTOR X602
Oh.  So even, but you are taking the iron.

PATIENT X602
I take those.

DOCTOR X602
Okay just the stool softener.

PATIENT X602
Right.

DOCTOR X602
Is the one you aren't taking?

PATIENT X602
Right.

DOCTOR X602
Okay and do you need more of the gabapentin?

PATIENT X602
What?

DOCTOR X602
Gabapentin is the one; I'm assuming they probably gave it to you like sometimes after you have an amputation you have sensations like you know like your leg is still there.

PATIENT X602
Yeah I do have those.

DOCTOR X602
You do have those.

PATIENT X602
Right, right.

DOCTOR X602
Okay so we'll make sure we refill those.

PATIENT X602
Yeah.

DOCTOR X602
Oh it looks like you're pretty much out of everything actually.

PATIENT X602
Except that one iron pill, I have quite a few of those.

DOCTOR X602
Yeah okay.  Let's make sure we reorder all that stuff for you then.

PATIENT X602
Okay.

DOCTOR X602
Do you want to pick it up here or do you have an address that it can be mailed to or?

PATIENT X602
Well I have to go get it now.

DOCTOR X602
Okay, since you're here you might as well go get it.

PATIENT X602
Right.

DOCTOR X602
Make sure you keep taking those vitamins too.

PATIENT X602
Of course I'm gonna keep taking the vitamins.

DOCTOR X602
Um sounds like you used to drink quite a bit.

PATIENT X602
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X602
So you probably have some vitamin deficiencies.

PATIENT X602
Hmm.

DOCTOR X602
Uh it is pretty hard for you to get out here?

PATIENT X602
I just, I call for the free ride, the chauffeur.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.

PATIENT X602
@@@.

DOCTOR X602
So it'd probably be easier to give you 90 day supplies, what do you think?

PATIENT X602
You do it.

DOCTOR X602
Will that work?

PATIENT X602
Yeah.

DOCTOR X602
Where are you living at?  Do you have somewhere to live?

PATIENT X602
Uh-huh.  ADDRESS.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.  You know we can change this metoprolol to; they have you on 25 every eight hours.  We could change it to once a day and that'll be easier @@@.

PATIENT X602
You want me to take it two times a day?

DOCTOR X602
I'll change it so it can be just once a day.

PATIENT X602
Okay.

DOCTOR X602
Rather than taking it two times a day, we'll change to one.

PATIENT X602
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X602
Are you pretty good about taking medicines or?

PATIENT X602
I got, if they want me to take it, I start out late, the one that I take two times a day.

DOCTOR X602
Good.

PATIENT X602
I take it all between 6 and 6.

DOCTOR X602
Good.  Oh it looks like you're on another once a day here, so we'll do it twice a day but we can change it to two times a day.

PATIENT X602
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X602
Are you taking the aspirin still?

PATIENT X602
Right.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.  It must be hard for you to go to uh starting taking all these pills when you're not used to it right?

PATIENT X602
Well like anything, muscles, at that time, I used to work with weights and I used to take it before that.  I used to check it @@@.  I @@@.

DOCTOR X602
Yeah.

PATIENT X602
Yeah that's the way.

DOCTOR X602
Yeah keep taking it, I know it's hard but you can.  You got plenty of support at home, people to help you out?

PATIENT X602
Oh just me really so.

DOCTOR X602
It's just you.

PATIENT X602
Right.

DOCTOR X602
You live by yourself?

PATIENT X602
Oh no, there's another person, my roommate there.

DOCTOR X602
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X602
She's there yeah.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.  And you follow up with uh, with Podiatry and everything.

PATIENT X602
Yes I go there next when I'm done here.

DOCTOR X602
Oh today.

PATIENT X602
Yeah I have an appointment at 1 o'clock, a 1 o'clock appointment and a 2 o'clock with him.

DOCTOR X602
You have a 2 o'clock appointment.

PATIENT X602
Right.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.

PATIENT X602
Uh @@@ that's why I'm late.

DOCTOR X602
Oh okay.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?

PATIENT X602
I don't even know what that is.

DOCTOR X602
Um well if you've never been to the doctor you probably haven't had it.

PATIENT X602
No I haven't.

DOCTOR X602
Um it's where they use um a camera and a tube and they look in your colon that goes through.

PATIENT X602
Oh yeah, I understand that, no.

DOCTOR X602
You've never had it before though right?

PATIENT X602
No, no.

DOCTOR X602
Okay.  Do you know, you know we usually actually suggest people start having them when they're 50 years old.

PATIENT X602
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X602
Um and then have them every 10 years so we can look for cancer.

PATIENT X602
Okay.

DOCTOR X602
Mainly because um you've done so good, not we just as doctors not wait as long but have gotten really good at finding them early so that if they are removed early.

PATIENT X602
Hmm.

DOCTOR X602
That we can prevent cancer from forming.

PATIENT X602
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X602
Um and then that's better than letting them you know be there, develop over time and keep developing.

PATIENT X602
Right, right.

DOCTOR X602
Then it causes a problem and then by the time, if you catch it late then it's um less likely that you can be cured from it.

PATIENT X602
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X602
So um if you're up to it, if you're interested I can set you up for it.

PATIENT X602
That's the thing, they use a camera up your.

DOCTOR X602
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X602
I'd like to think about this.  @@@.

DOCTOR X602
I know I have to actually, my dad was not very happy with him when I forced him to do it.  Why don't you think about it, next time I see you then we can?

PATIENT X602
Okay the next appointment yeah; I'll give you the answer.

DOCTOR X602
Okay, okay, alright.  Give me just a second okay.  

PATIENT X602

DOCTOR X602

PATIENT X602

When you go out its right across the hall um and you just sign in and I'll have the labs put into the computer that I want them to check and they'll draw some blood.  You don't have to stay and wait for them though, if there's anything abnormal I could call you with it.

PATIENT X602

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
Uh-huh did it help?

PATIENT X580
Yeah that is the ibuprofen.  My ibuprofen, I have acid reflux now real bad.

DOCTOR X580
Okay.

PATIENT X580
I need something for that and the doctor he gave me some paperwork here for uh he wanted me to go to the Substance Abuse Clinic.

DOCTOR X580
Okay.

PATIENT X580
See and I want to get that started so I can get them out in the works, whatever it takes.  And then I also want you to make me an appointment to see the eye doctor and foot doctor.

DOCTOR X580
Alright let me make a note of this here, eye doctor, foot doctor, Substance Abuse Clinic, ibuprofen and acid reflux.  Alright.  I'll quickly put in the request for the eye doctor then and just go down everything one by one.  Tell me why you need to see the eye doctor.

PATIENT X580
I had glasses.

DOCTOR X580
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X580
And they got misplaced so that's one of the reasons I need to see the eye doctor to get some new glasses.

DOCTOR X580
Gotcha.

PATIENT X580
I need glasses.  

DOCTOR X580
And you saw them.

PATIENT X580
The foot doctor, I saw the foot doctor but the calluses have come back.

DOCTOR X580
Well uh do you have arthritis at all?

PATIENT X580
Well not, it don't bother me but I have it.

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
Okay.  Okay.  I can get you some of those pills.  The VA can only mail those out; you can't pick those up here.

PATIENT X580
Okay fine.

DOCTOR X580
And you're limited to two pills a month.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
That's, for some reason that's come down from higher up that's all we can give.

PATIENT X580
That'd be fine.

DOCTOR X580
So we'll do that.  We'll also check some blood work cause sometimes if there's something you know wrong in the blood that might be a reason why too and we've got to figure that out.

PATIENT X580
@@@.  It still might be an idea @@@.

DOCTOR X580
Oh you got this done at UIC huh?

PATIENT X580
Yeah well I got it different guy, he did it.

DOCTOR X580
When did you stop?

PATIENT X580
When I got locked up, it was a hot day.

DOCTOR X580
It looks like you're trying to stop.

PATIENT X580
Yeah no drinking or smoking.

DOCTOR X580
No drinking or smoking.

PATIENT X580
Yeah.  That's why I'm @@@ and wanted to show them to you.

DOCTOR X580
Alright.  Well we actually have a Liver Clinic here that can treat people who have hepatitis C.

PATIENT X580
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X580
As long as they're still not smoking or drinking they'll consider you for treatment.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
It'd be great if I could get them to see you.  You're okay with seeing them?

PATIENT X580
@@@.

DOCTOR X580
Alright well I'll ask them to make you an appointment too.

PATIENT X580
Can you make it?

DOCTOR X580
And what I'll do is we'll see if our clerk up front can and if they can't schedule you they'll send you something in the mail and you'll give them a call.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
Whatever time that works well for both of you.

PATIENT X580
Well what about this?  This substance abuse?

DOCTOR X580

PATIENT X580
Ibuprofen, that's for my back.

DOCTOR X580
Okay.

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
Were you taking anything for your blood pressure?

PATIENT X580
No.  Never have.

DOCTOR X580

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
Nothing but the ibuprofen.

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
Well your blood pressure looks like it's a little bit up today.

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
And it was a little bit up the last time I saw you too.

PATIENT X580
It was.  But only one pill if I have to take it I take it.

DOCTOR X580
We'll get some medications for you today too.  And how about, you look like you're missing some teeth.

DOCTOR X580
Gotcha.  Do you see Dentistry in here or, some people some of our dentists outside of the VA?

DOCTOR X580
I see okay.  Let's see.

PATIENT X580
You can put up all those appointments.

DOCTOR X580
Dentists, we'll try to get this stuff set up first and then once this is getting better we'll talk about your teeth.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
What I want you to do you know for the, they have some paperwork that they'll have you do at Admitting to see if you qualify for the dental services here.  I guess it has to do with how much service connected you are and how much they'll cover and stuff like that.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
If you're covered by dental here we can have them see you but if you're not then they won't even, they'll only take emergencies.

PATIENT X580
Oh.

DOCTOR X580
It might not be worth it.

PATIENT X580
I mean I been waiting till I'm done.  I'm trying to get a claim for disability now.

DOCTOR X580

DOCTOR X580
You're feeling tired overall huh?

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
Well it might have a little bit to do with the hepatitis as well.

PATIENT X580

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580
Alright PATIENT.  Very good.  So we'll go through this list one by one with you.  So we'll have you pick up your medications today.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
They'll be the ibuprofen um 800, pick it up from the window and we're gonna start you on a blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X580
Okay.  What about this acid reflux?

DOCTOR X580
I can get you something for that too, hold on a second.  Acid reflux uh, do you usually take medications?  Is it after every meal or is it worse when you lie down in bed?

PATIENT X580
It's worse when I lay down in bed.  I have to jump out of bed and run to the bathroom.

DOCTOR X580
Gotcha.  When you run to the bathroom what happens?

PATIENT X580
It just make me feel like I'm losing my stomach.

DOCTOR X580
Okay.  I'm gonna give you something, it says to take it at bedtime but I would probably take it like half an hour or an hour before you actually lie down to go to bed.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
If it bothers you during the day as well you can take this medication up to twice a day so you could take it at morning and night.

PATIENT X580
And see this stuff here; it's been keeping it under control until at night.

DOCTOR X580
Gotcha.  You can keep taking it if you want.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
Okay.  Like a multivitamin sort of thing you've got going on here.

PATIENT X580
Okay, so it won't hurt.

DOCTOR X580
For the eyes we will send you to uh, I'll ask them to schedule a follow-up for you in the Eye Clinic.  You saw them, if you see them within like a two year period they don't count you as a new patient, you're a follow-up one so if they can't schedule you you'll have to call and just say I want to make a follow-up appointment.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
You'll be a new patient in the Nail Care Clinic; this is the Podiatry Clinic who takes care of the calluses.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
Uh the Liver Clinic you're also gonna be a new patient in.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
And the Addictions Clinic.  They should be able to direct you to the Addiction Central Intake.  They have their own office where they make their appointments.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
So the front desk will tell you how to get there.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
Uh Admitting will have some paperwork to see if you qualify for the dental stuff.

PATIENT X580
When I leave here.

DOCTOR X580
Yeah hopefully.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
So the places that I want you to stop off at are the front desk, the Pharmacy and the Laboratory we're gonna get some blood work cause it's been about a year and a half now.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
Okay.  I want to see you back in a month just to see how all of these things have kind of played out.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
Maybe after the holidays, like the early January, you could come in; we could check your blood pressure again with just the nurse.

PATIENT X580
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR X580
And then if your blood pressure is still high we can change the medication a little bit.

PATIENT X580
Okay.

DOCTOR X580
Alright.  Then sorry that you were in jail but I'm glad that they took the opportunity to get you to stop drinking and stop smoking.

PATIENT X580
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X580
Kind of get everything back together.

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580

PATIENT X580

DOCTOR X580

PATIENT X580
So when I'll be expecting it?  One week, two weeks?

DOCTOR X580

PATIENT X580
Okay, alright thank you.

DOCTOR X580

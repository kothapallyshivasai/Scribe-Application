DOCTOR X80
Come on back.  How's everything going?

PATIENT X80
I'm hanging in there.

DOCTOR X80
Good.  Your blood pressure was a little high when you first came in.

PATIENT X80
Yeah.

DOCTOR X80
@@@ running around.  @@@ rechecked it and it was 136/84 so. 

PATIENT X80
I know @@@.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah this time, the past three times when we've rechecked it it's always been 120s @@@.  Are you in any pain today?  Could be that why it's elevated.

PATIENT X80
I'm getting pain today because I'm kind of @@@ actually.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
No, actually when I saw you in January you was gonna put some orders in for me to uh have an eye consult.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah did they not schedule your eye appointment?

PATIENT X80
No eye appointment, no Ortho consult, no.

DOCTOR X80
Well remember we were going to try the physical therapy before we tried the Ortho consult and we ordered those films.  We wanted to take a look at those films so that's why the Ortho consult wasn't placed yet because we had ordered those films of your knees to look and see if there were any fracture or dislocation or anything that @@@ images first and the physical therapy is it helping your knees?

PATIENT X80
Well I, let me see I only went one more time because he said uh I don't know, he wanted me to continue but.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah.

PATIENT X80
But the guy downstairs he and I wanted to continue going but you know I guess he had to, he had to get something from you to continue with it and since that didn't happen.

DOCTOR X80
Well we should be able to continue that, I mean physical therapy isn't usually just one session.

PATIENT X80
Well I had @@@.

DOCTOR X80
It looks like you went multiple times.

PATIENT X80
I went multiple times.

DOCTOR X80
Okay, did you feel like you needed to continue with it?

PATIENT X80
I felt, I wanted to continue but he said you know, I don't know, I guess he needed something in writing I don't know, I guess.

DOCTOR X80
Okay but did you feel that you would benefit from more physical therapy?

PATIENT X80
He said I could.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
Uh but then.

DOCTOR X80
Do you feel like it was helping you?

PATIENT X80
It was helping with the strengthening you know.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.  Okay it looks like you did try to do some, the Physical Therapy Clinic.

PATIENT X80
Right.

DOCTOR X80
It shows you had had 11 sessions.

PATIENT X80
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X80
So it looks like you were tolerating the exercises and doing well with the treatment.  But you don't feel like it was really helpful?

PATIENT X80
It's just, you know, it helped with strengthening, you know strengthening my legs but.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
But helping with my pain or anything like that @@@.

DOCTOR X80
Okay so it helped you @@@ but you're still having and it helped with your stability as well?

PATIENT X80
No, not really.

DOCTOR X80
No.

PATIENT X80
No.

DOCTOR X80
So you feel like unsteady when you're walking?

PATIENT X80
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.

PATIENT X80
Uh-huh and he's the one that gave me the cane.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
Uh and then let's see what else.

DOCTOR X80
Do you take anything for the pain?

PATIENT X80
Naprosyn.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  Is that helping?

PATIENT X80
I've been taking that for so long it's not really effective anymore.  I've been taking that for you know almost 10 years.

DOCTOR X80
10 years, that's a long time.

PATIENT X80
A long time.

DOCTOR X80
You're putting yourself at risk for a ulcer.

PATIENT X80
Right.

DOCTOR X80
Okay, how much Naprosyn are you taking?

PATIENT X80
250.

DOCTOR X80
And how often do you take it?

PATIENT X80
Uh twice a day, sometimes three times a day.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.

PATIENT X80
Uh.

DOCTOR X80
But it's not really doing any good?

PATIENT X80
No.

DOCTOR X80
Okay, I would stop it then if it's not helping you, then it's just putting you at risk for an ulcer.

PATIENT X80
Alright.

DOCTOR X80
Since it's not helping your pain.  Um okay so you those x-rays that we took continue to show the degenerative joint disease and the narrowing of the disk space but it didn't show any fractures or dislocation but we can send you to Ortho um now that we have the films and it does um @@@ if you would benefit from surgery.  They can evaluate you for that.

PATIENT X80
Um what about the colonoscopy?

DOCTOR X80
Is that something that you're still interested in?

PATIENT X80
Yeah you said you were gonna.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah did you go and get the labs done?

PATIENT X80
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X80
Okay, so let's take a look at the labs here.  You went and had blood drawn?

PATIENT X80
Yeah.  You said you were gonna order me some of that stuff for my skin, for the dry skin Absorbase, never got that.

DOCTOR X80
Okay, so you don't have all the labs that you need for the colonoscopy.  Can you go down to the Lab today for some blood work and we can get that done.  So could you.

PATIENT X80
I didn't get the labs done, I thought I did.

DOCTOR X80
Those were different so before you had you know your cholesterol checked, that was back in, that was a while back, back in November I think, yeah back in January when you had your cholesterol getting checked and the hepatitis C and your prostate enzyme, all of that good stuff.  But you didn't get screening labs for your colonoscopy at that time so we need to order specific screening labs first just to review them and then we can refer you for the colonoscopy so.

PATIENT X80
So okay, so after I get the labs done then I'm gonna have to have another appointment or what?

DOCTOR X80
No you don't need another appointment.  I will see the labs and then I'll schedule you for the colonoscopy okay.  So let's go ahead and order these labs.

PATIENT X80
Yeah I'll get them done tomorrow morning, I got something else tonight.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.

PATIENT X80
I got to go back there.

DOCTOR X80
That's fine.  Okay so I've ordered the @@@ labs um, the physical therapy is not helping so we put in for Ortho to see you and you want the Absorbase you said?

PATIENT X80
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  Do you want to pick that up today?

PATIENT X80
Yeah sure.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  And you're using that for dry skin?

PATIENT X80
For dry skin.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.

PATIENT X80
And uh I need to go to the Eye Clinic uh, I couldn't do a walk-in, I mentioned that when I saw you in January, I tried to go in and see if they had.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
It'd been almost a year that I had been in their so I needed to go our time here.

DOCTOR X80
It doesn't look like that won't, okay @@@.  Where do you usually come in, all over?

PATIENT X80

DOCTOR X80

DOCTOR X80
Also there's the colonoscopy labs you can go for tomorrow.

PATIENT X80
Yeah tomorrow, yeah.  What about the Eye consult?

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.  So what was going on with your eyes?

PATIENT X80
Um a few years ago um I started having blurred vision so I came in and with the guys in the Eye Clinic.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
And uh you know they dilated @@@ and did all that and did some additional tests.  They said they wanted to keep an eye on something, make sure I come back within a year but I kind of you know, I didn't follow up like I should have and that's probably why you know they wouldn't let me just walk back in because it had been over a year.

DOCTOR X80
You needed a few more tests?

PATIENT X80
Yes.

DOCTOR X80
Okay. 

PATIENT X80
It was something specific that they wanted to watch for but.

DOCTOR X80
Have you been having any vision symptoms?

PATIENT X80
Uh some yes.

DOCTOR X80

PATIENT X80
Uh just the continued uh.

DOCTOR X80
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
As I used to.

DOCTOR X80
And you think that um.

PATIENT X80
I think.

DOCTOR X80
That when you're looking at things far away or close?

PATIENT X80
When um, normally, usually my far vision isn't affected.  My distance vision hasn't really been affected in the past but that's starting to be affected too.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.

PATIENT X80
So it's both.

DOCTOR X80
Near and distant as well.

PATIENT X80

DOCTOR X80

PATIENT X80
Cause I gotta a you know.

DOCTOR X80
But that doesn't help @@@ at all.

PATIENT X80

Okay.  I see.  How long did you, are you still taking the Tylenol and the ibuprofen?

PATIENT X80

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  I'm going to take that off your medication list.  I'm going to show you're using that.

And uh, like I said I'm having my follow-up today.  I still got some sutures in my mouth.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.

PATIENT X80
They gonna remove @@@.

DOCTOR X80
I would stop taking your Naproxen because it's not helping your knee pain and if you're taking that much of it you're gonna just put yourself at risk for an ulcer.

PATIENT X80
Uh-huh, right I.  And I hadn't been taking the Naproxen anyway.

DOCTOR X80
Oh I thought you said you've been taking.

PATIENT X80
I had been taking the Advil.  You know I had been taking the Naprosyn like for years.

DOCTOR X80
Oh uh-huh.

PATIENT X80
But then I ran out, I didn't try to get anymore.

DOCTOR X80
Oh because it wasn't helping.

PATIENT X80
Wasn't helping.

DOCTOR X80

PATIENT X80
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X80
But you're not, no active infection right now and your labs are not typical for disease @@@.

PATIENT X80
So could I give blood?

DOCTOR X80
Um, they'll probably want to do screening labs when you give blood.  Sometimes @@@ infection in the past they will not allow you to give blood.  I don't know exactly what their rules are.

PATIENT X80
Okay.  And the only reason I asked that uh I have a common type.

Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X80
So the first few times that you use it, make sure that you don't drive afterwards.

PATIENT X80
Oh I'm not driving now.

DOCTOR X80
Okay good.  Just kind of monitor yourself after you take it and make sure that your mind is still clear, you don't have any confusion and it's not making you drowsy or sleepy or anything like that okay.

DOCTOR X80
Okay let me just talk to my boss real quick.  Anything else you wanted to discuss?

PATIENT X80
No.

DOCTOR X80
@@@ take a seat up there.  @@@.  Take some big deep breaths.  Good.  Your lungs sound good right now.  After you stop smoking you can prevent yourself from developing emphysema.  I'm on service right now at the VA and we see people coming in all the time.

PATIENT X80
With emphysema?

DOCTOR X80
Emphysema.

PATIENT X80
Yeah, like in the Smoking Cessation Class.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah, you problem see.

PATIENT X80
Almost all the guys, almost all of them have emphysema.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah.

PATIENT X80
And asthma.

DOCTOR X80
And asthma too.

PATIENT X80
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X80
Go ahead and lay back, @@@ underneath.  You're able to bend it?

PATIENT X80
Yes, part of that without hurting.

DOCTOR X80
Can you bend it any further?

PATIENT X80
Nope.

DOCTOR X80
Nope.  And how about this one?

PATIENT X80
This one's kind of not as bad.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.

PATIENT X80
Like the last one so.

DOCTOR X80
xxxd it again for me.  Did that cause any pain?

PATIENT X80
No.

DOCTOR X80
What about this?

PATIENT X80
That does, especially in the hip, not in the knee.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  But it doesn't cause any pain in the knee?

PATIENT X80
No.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  Alright.  @@@ it looks like you do have some restriction and some stiffness, @@@ may be able to @@@.  So the left side looked better.

PATIENT X80
It's worse than that.  That's also the one that locks, snaps and pops all the time.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  (doctor working on computer)  @@@.

PATIENT X80
Right.

DOCTOR X80
Heading in the right direction huh.

PATIENT X80
Yeah.

DOCTOR X80
Good for you.

PATIENT X80
@@@.  All those crazy wild days are over. 

DOCTOR X80
Good.  Where are you living at?

PATIENT X80
Uh, presently I'm just staying with my mom.

DOCTOR X80
Okay.  

PATIENT X80
It's a temporary situation of course.

DOCTOR X80
Sure.

PATIENT X80
Uh when I get back to working.  

DOCTOR X80
Well, I'll be right back.

PATIENT X80
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  37:36  DOCTOR IN:  48:48)

DOCTOR X80
Okay sir, she agreed with our plan.  The only suggestion she had was to use just to try diclofenac instead of um tramadol just because tramadol @@@ property so it probably would be better to try something without those properties first and try um.

PATIENT X80
What is that that you said, what is it?

DOCTOR X80
Diclofenac.  It's a stronger anti-inflammatory medicine, it's stronger than Naproxen so.

PATIENT X80
Okay.

DOCTOR X80
So we'll try that and you can pick that up today too.  @@@.

PATIENT X80
@@@.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah it's not really what we use that often but @@@ so.  Cause usually Naproxen helps most people but.

PATIENT X80
Unless they've been taking it forever huh.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah @@@.  

PATIENT X80
I been taking it for a long time.

DOCTOR X80
So let's try something different.

PATIENT X80
I'm surprised no one's ever suggested coming off of that and trying something else.

DOCTOR X80
Yeah.

PATIENT X80
@@@.

DOCTOR X80
@@@.

PATIENT X80
They always ask me how long have you been taking it and I tell them and they just keep prescribing it.

DOCTOR X80
I know, so if it's helping then they'll still continue it but if it's not helping you then what's the point right?

PATIENT X80
@@@ from time to time anyway though.  I think you know, will that cause ulcers too?

DOCTOR X80
It can so they'll probably want you to take it with food.  They're going to @@@.

PATIENT X80
Yeah I always take it with food I don't, yeah I don't take without food.

DOCTOR X80
Okay, so you take it once in the morning @@@.  Alright.  So it sounds like they wanted you to go back up front, or go back to Room @@@ on the 22nd for a @@@.  Do you just want to wait over here in the Waiting Room?  Okay take care @@@.  There you go.

PATIENT X80
We'll try again.

PATIENT LEAVES:  51:32.

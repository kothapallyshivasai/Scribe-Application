DOCTOR X255
I'm DOCTOR, nice to meet you. @@@.  How you doing?

PATIENT X255
Good.

DOCTOR X255
Uh 72 huh finally.

PATIENT X255
Yeah.

DOCTOR X255
It's kind of a tease at the moment.  It looks nicer than it is out there.  Yeah.  Uh how have things been going?

PATIENT X255
Oh just you know, it might be the cholesterol medicine and I did take that uh @@@.  But when I call them up to refill it, it just @@@ something like that.

DOCTOR X255
I know that's strange @@@.

PATIENT X255
But the uh, the new reflux pill works perfect.

DOCTOR X255
Does it?

PATIENT X255
Oh and @@@ feel, where that's burning you know, in the chest and that and I'm taking one pill a morning but when I do there's improvement @@@.  Cause for the last month, I got a cold and during the you now blowing your nose, @@@ it feels like I'm congested in the head and when I blow the nose my nose bleeds, not a lot but just you know a little bit on the Kleenex and then I'm always stuffy now and it's oh, been like a month.

DOCTOR X255
You never had that before?

PATIENT X255
No.

DOCTOR X255
And you're stuffed up now?

PATIENT X255
Basically stuffed up, just hard to breathe just at night.

DOCTOR X255
Yep.

PATIENT X255
@@@.

DOCTOR X255
Uh okay uh @@@.

PATIENT X255
And I've been feeling kind of crampy and drained out but uh @@@ but the @@@ is like you know just about normal.  I mean it's you know you get that kind of thing where it's difficult to you know put on your socks and shoes but the pain tolerance.  Cause I get the uh, you told me to switch to the Excedrin so I take that and it relieves it a little bit and I really don't, you know, I'm not physical.  I don't you know really do anything but walk the dog.   

DOCTOR X255
You have, that's alright.  Do you drink any alcohol?

PATIENT X255
Oh yeah I have a beer once in a while and uh someone had a birthday yesterday so we got a couple of glasses of wine with dinner.  But drinks, mixed drinks, I don't drink.

DOCTOR X255
Uh you haven't had any thyroid problems?

PATIENT X255
No my dad had a thyroid problem.  I just remember hearing about it.

DOCTOR X255
Now your cholesterol has been going down slowly yet.

PATIENT X255
Would you like me keeping taking the pills or?

DOCTOR X255
Oh yeah, so you're almost there with your bad cholesterol.  You're almost where you need to be um but uh the triglycerides.

PATIENT X255
Hmm.

DOCTOR X255
Are up pretty high as well.

PATIENT X255
Oh it's high?

DOCTOR X255
Yes.

PATIENT X255
Do you think they should be like 100 something?

DOCTOR X255
Under 160 your triglycerides.  Your are 480.

PATIENT X255
Oh.

DOCTOR X255
So.

PATIENT X255
Well that could be, since I wasn't taking the medicine though right?

DOCTOR X255
Well the medicine, you know actually come on over here I want to show you this stuff here.  So here's your good cholesterol, your LDL is your bad cholesterol and that's 105.  We like that over 100 if possible.  You're not far off.

PATIENT X255
It's not good.

DOCTOR X255
That's not too bad.  This is often the more important one.  This is the one that causes more trouble with heart attacks and strokes, things like that.

PATIENT X255
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X255
This can be, @@@ go the triglycerides.  Uh especially when they get over 500, that can actually irritate your pancreas and give you pancreatitis.

PATIENT X255
Oh.

DOCTOR X255
Um the guideline @@@ is to go after this one first uh, it's kind of like splitting hairs.  If we keep this our goal, that doesn't help out your overall health.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
But after you get to that goal, it's just, it's still high and so you're on some medication that really cuts it down quite a bit but this is the more important one.

PATIENT X255
Now is it just because like it's a liver thing or @@@ cause you know @@@ it's not what's going on with the heart.  So could that be from not doing any of these things.  I mean not walking?

DOCTOR X255
It could definitely be you know, it takes several months of good exercise to kind of help that uh.  Alcohol can definitely make that worse.

PATIENT X255
Well like I might have within a week, I might have two drinks.   Is that bad?

DOCTOR X255
Most of the time?  The trouble is the triglycerides can irritate the pancreas and alcohol will do the same thing.  @@@.  So there's a couple medications that we can do to try and bring that down um one, there are a few that I prescribe that have slightly increased risks of giving you muscle cramps and muscle breakdown like the statin you're taking now but there's also fish oil which can help bring those triglycerides down.  It might be good for you to take this one.

PATIENT X255
Okay.  Cause anything that gives me cramps I couldn't take it anymore.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  

PATIENT X255
My cramps, you know like your foot is regular like this.  My foot would come to @@@ size and the toes would @@@ and I can't even @@@ now.  They can stay like that for 20 minutes at a time and finally get straight, they'd be straight and relax for a little bit and then it's start again and do the same thing.

DOCTOR X255
Now this one's going to be more like the big @@@ muscles the arms, things like that.

PATIENT X255
Oh.

DOCTOR X255
@@@.  So in particular it can cause a little bit of diarrhea.

PATIENT X255
@@@.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  @@@.  Any chest pain, any trouble breathing?

PATIENT X255
@@@.  Then I caught a cold.  @@@ and I get, you know it got worse and never got better.  It got better when I got over all the coughing but it just, I never just got back and stayed like that.

DOCTOR X255
I actually am going to increase that statin medicine.  The pravastatin you're taking, we're going to give you a whole pill.

PATIENT X255
And that's for the cholesterol?

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  

PATIENT X255
Cause I supposed to be taking a half.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  When do you take it?  What time of day?

PATIENT X255
I take it once cause I used to take it every morning about 9 o'clock and the other one I take it at the same time, I take it at bedtime.

DOCTOR X255
I prefer that you take that simvastatin at nighttime.

PATIENT X255
At bedtime it's easy. 

DOCTOR X255
The one for reflux, uh it kind of looks the same.

PATIENT X255
So I should still take it in the morning?

DOCTOR X255
This one you take @@@.

PATIENT X255
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X255
But it's not @@@.  The only one that really matters is the statin.

PATIENT X255
Okay, take it.

DOCTOR X255
The body makes more cholesterol when you're sleeping.

PATIENT X255
Oh yeah?

DOCTOR X255
So those medications kind of work.

PATIENT X255
Like after dinner take it?

DOCTOR X255
Yeah right before you go to bed.

PATIENT X255
Okay, I'll just take it then.

DOCTOR X255
But uh those medications kind of work a little bit better at bedtime, uh @@@ pill.

PATIENT X255
Now is that going to be the same numbers that I had for my calling in.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah always you can call into the same place.  So the simvastatin and the @@@.

PATIENT X255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X255
You need to start taking the full pill.

PATIENT X255
I don't have any.

DOCTOR X255
Oh you don't okay.

PATIENT X255
There are some things they could have thrown that out because I haven't had it for over a month.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah well it looks like it expired you know a while back. Uh so I just reordered it for you, but yeah @@@.

PATIENT X255
@@@.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah @@@ same time.

PATIENT X255
Okay.  Oh I pick it up before I leave?

DOCTOR X255
Oh if you want to you can, otherwise I was just going to have it mailed.

PATIENT X255
Oh okay yeah that's good.

DOCTOR X255
Let's take a look at what you're doing.  @@@.  Um otherwise what I want to do is get some blood work from you.

PATIENT X255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X255
@@@ today and three months.

PATIENT X255
I didn't fast today.

DOCTOR X255
That's fine.

PATIENT X255
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X255
Uh let me have a quick look at you.  Any ear pain or obstruction?

PATIENT X255
Yeah the ear is always ringing and I took things @@@.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.

PATIENT X255
And uh it started in the service cause I could always sort of hear it.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.

PATIENT X255
So they had treated me for that @@@, I did one and I took it once so then they did two and then it would @@@ and @@@.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.

PATIENT X255
So then the doctor said that what was happening is the hearing aids were intensifying the ringing in my head, they just made it worse.  I could hear, you know I mean I could hear you better but what I.  @@@.

DOCTOR X255
Uh open up for me ah.

PATIENT X255
Ah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X255
Give me deep breath.  Is there any blood in your stool?

PATIENT X255
Uh like if I'm really constipated it like affects the hemorrhoids and then I'll have blood, blood in the stool but not that much.

DOCTOR X255
Okay.  Yeah it's probably uh.

PATIENT X255
So @@@.  But this leg could be like ice, it'll be like cold and you get like @@@ is that like normal?

DOCTOR X255
Now what happened, the reason why you got rid of the foot drop and then?

PATIENT X255
I had a back operation.

DOCTOR X255
Okay so it's all from nerve damage.  Yeah it's likely due to the nerves.

PATIENT X255
These now, you know how you hear people are kind of weak in the legs, there's no circulation there.  I @@@ up in there.

DOCTOR X255
Let me have you pop your shoes off real quick, your shoes and socks.  @@@.  

PATIENT X255
Just the one right doc?

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  

PATIENT X255
It looks like these toes are maybe too long.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.

PATIENT X255
It's just @@@ a different kind of, like @@@ you know like just a different color.  This will be whiter and this will be like really red.  It gets real red all the way down and it's just like @@@ pick up a little bit you know.

DOCTOR X255
This one is just cold, so you sure don't have much circulation.  Can you feel me touching right here?

PATIENT X255
No.

DOCTOR X255
These are all @@@ it's a nerve problem.  So unfortunately there's not really much I can do.

PATIENT X255
@@@.  I can't feel like anything down here just past the heel.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah that's from nerve damage.

PATIENT X255
Is that what it is?

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  Those nerves that go down into the foot, they start up in the back.  This is where they come out, down there.

PATIENT X255
Like this I can feel but you can't feel nothing down there.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah so everything is started in the back and then they kind of split up as they go down and if there is, even if the problem is at the back, if there is just a compression on part of it, then that could be an injury, you know depending on what part of that nerve had some kind of damage to it, that could be like here and this could fine or it could be down there and this would be damaged.

PATIENT X255
@@@ come back?  For a while I did physical therapy.

DOCTOR X255
Nerve damage takes a long long time to come back.

PATIENT X255
Yeah.  This has been like four years.

DOCTOR X255
But it's been several years so I don't think this is ever coming back uh.  I mean @@@.  It's just one of those things and people have trouble with nerves for a long time.  It usually takes at least several months.

PATIENT X255
But that's with good circulation right?

DOCTOR X255
Yeah with good @@@.

PATIENT X255
But I mean, its okay I just can't use it @@@ okay.

DOCTOR X255
Right.  @@@.

PATIENT X255
Oh man.  @@@ the worst.

DOCTOR X255
No.  Uh, alright for the nose, do you ever have trouble with allergies?

PATIENT X255
No.

DOCTOR X255
Do you feel like you're draining a lot or does it feel like you're stuffed up and you can't get anything out?

PATIENT X255
It feels like it's stuffed up.  I'll take two showers a day, heat it up and then I take @@@ and it breaks it up a little bit.

DOCTOR X255
Well there's a couple things we can do for this.  I want you to take ibuprofen just for you know a couple of days.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
@@@ cause you know you had some trouble when you were taking all that ibuprofen with bleeding uh, what that can do is help reduce any inflammation there.

PATIENT X255
But just regular ibuprofen right?

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  And then I'm gonna get you a nasal spray as well.

PATIENT X255
What do you think of Vicks, would that be bad?

DOCTOR X255
That actually could just help you a bit.

PATIENT X255
Yeah that's what I do when it's really bad, I use that and it seems to open it up a little bit.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah that's totally fine.  So this an Afrin nasal spray, oxymetazoline um and that can help open things up.  You take it twice a day but I don't want you taking it for more than three days.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
Uh if you want I can have you pick that up today.

PATIENT X255
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X255
If that'd be easier for you, it's over-the-counter.  But the problem is if you use it for more than three days and then stop it, sometimes you get what is called rebound and you can end up getting worse.

PATIENT X255
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X255
So cut it off at three days uh.  If you're having a lot of mucous, which it doesn't sound like, it sounds like it's more you know drainage and @@@, I could probably prescribe @@@.  Then you can take like a Mucinex, stuff like that.  You could try Zyrtec as well for allergies; it has some anti-inflammatories with that.  @@@ did you want to pick that up today too?

PATIENT X255
Oh yeah I could you know wait for it, that's no problem.  Do you want to do the blood tests today?

DOCTOR X255
Yeah the blood tests will be today.  So it's actually going to be today and @@@ taking too long, we've got to watch your liver function.  Your liver function looks okay but there's a lot @@@.

PATIENT X255
Hmm.

DOCTOR X255
Uh so we've got the simvastatin and we changed the dosage @@@.

PATIENT X255
@@@.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah we just need to check it again when we change it.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
And @@@.

PATIENT X255
So I'll come back in two weeks for another blood test?

DOCTOR X255
Yes just the blood test, you don't have to come to the clinic or anything like that.

PATIENT X255
And I won't have to fast?

DOCTOR X255
No, you won't have to fast for that.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
And then in three months I'd like you to come back to the clinic and they'll do blood work around that time and that one you'll need to be fasting.

PATIENT X255
Okay.  Now will the VA send me something.

DOCTOR X255
They should.

PATIENT X255
Yeah.

DOCTOR X255
But uh if you don't hear anything then you need to call us.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
So @@@ the Zyrtec @@@, it's also over-the-counter, it's an allergy pill.  If things start cleaning up you don't have to take it.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
Alright, you can pick up the nasal spray today.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
And I'm going to send you out the simvastatin.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255
We'll do blood work today, two weeks and then fasting blood work in three months.

PATIENT X255
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X255
And then you'll come back to see me, actually it won't be me.

PATIENT X255
In July.

DOCTOR X255
Yeah.  Uh so I'm actually going to be gone and I'm actually moving to xxx xxx.

PATIENT X255
Oh really.

DOCTOR X255
So I won't be here so you'll have to get set up with another @@@ resident @@@.

PATIENT X255
Okay.  xxx xxx, you're going far.

DOCTOR X255
Uh I'm from there originally.

PATIENT X255

DOCTOR X255

PATIENT X255

PATIENT X255

DOCTOR X255
So uh it looks like everything else is pretty well set up and I'm going to set you free but uh get the blood work today and.

PATIENT X255
Do I go down to the basement for that where they do the blood?

DOCTOR X255
When you check out up front here, uh @@@.

PATIENT X255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X255
Uh ask them if they're, I'm not sure if they're still doing it down the hallway.

PATIENT X255
Okay.

DOCTOR X255

PATIENT X255

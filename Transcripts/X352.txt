PATIENT X352
Hello doctor.

DOCTOR X352
Hi.

PATIENT X352
How are you?

DOCTOR X352
Good.  How you feeling, you okay?

PATIENT X352
Good.  Good to see you.

DOCTOR X352
Good to see you.  Everything you need.

PATIENT X352
Finally after all of another year is gone.

DOCTOR X352
Remind me how to say your last name?

PATIENT X352
PATIENT.

DOCTOR X352
PATIENT.  Alright.  Come on back and have a seat.

PATIENT X352
Sure.

DOCTOR X352
I can take your jacket if you like.

PATIENT X352
Oh I'll just leave it here on the chair.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
Because I got my cell phone in there and it falls out sometimes.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
Yeah.

DOCTOR X352
Well how have you been?

PATIENT X352
Uh not too bad, not too good.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
One of the things that's really uh, a larger source of aggravation in the past.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Is my arthritis.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
I know that I was prescribed diclofenac I believe it is. 

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Uh the dosage is twice a day, I believe its 7.5 mg.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
I don't know if its enough and I don't if it's even the right drug.

DOCTOR X352
Right.

PATIENT X352
By the way I've run out of it, two days ago and they won't refill it downstairs because there's not a standing prescription.

DOCTOR X352
Hmm, yeah it's expired that's right.  So why do you think you don't know if it's the right drug.  Has it been helping enough with your pain?

PATIENT X352
It didn't.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
In fact I was in Emergency here about a month and a half ago.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
With severe pain.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And basically the doctor who attended to me at the time just said hey you know there's nothing more I can do.  He says you know, he was a sufferer as well.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
With that and.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
He says you know there's nothing that even I can take for myself otherwise I'd give it to you but I think its two different conditions.  Ones arthritis, is there something else?

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
But you know, all the same uh basically I walked away with nothing.

DOCTOR X352
Okay and your pain is mostly in your back?

PATIENT X352
It's right above my right hip.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
And then it radiates all the way down, all the way down my thigh, all the way down the outer thigh.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Okay all the way down into my calf, up through my neck right to the base of the skull.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
It's like a ribbon.  I mean it literally feels like it's a hot ribbon.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
In my body.

DOCTOR X352
So you're having the pain, also it shoots all the way up your back to your neck or just near your neck?

PATIENT X352
It goes all the way up through my neck right to the base of the skull.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
Okay.  It's a very narrow.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Type feeling.  I don't know, it feels like somebody.  I don't know how else to describe it other than like it's a ribbon that's been heated up and just placed from my neck all the way down to my ankle.

DOCTOR X352
Okay and how long has it been getting worse for?

PATIENT X352
Uh probably a few months.  Ever since the episode with the TIA back in October.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.  Alright and anything make it better?

PATIENT X352
No nothing.  Is that um.

DOCTOR X352
Is the.

PATIENT X352
I'll use Tylenol sometimes at night.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
When it's worse.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
And I only get about four hours of sleep till it wakes me up.

DOCTOR X352
Did the diclofenac.

PATIENT X352
Yeah.

DOCTOR X352
That's a mouthful, does that make it better?

PATIENT X352
Well that's what I was initially prescribed that medication after my TIA.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
By an outside physician.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
A physician that I had used for years.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
Um.

DOCTOR X352
Are you still seeing that outside physician?

PATIENT X352
No.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
No in fact I had to drop my Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance.

DOCTOR X352
Hmm, sorry to hear that.

PATIENT X352
Yeah uh well that's just the financial fact.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
Especially for myself and my wife.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
I maintained hers.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Because that's all I could afford.

DOCTOR X352
Okay so.

PATIENT X352
Uh but he switched me off the meloxicam.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
To go to that.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
I have been complaining of a lot more severe pain and he says okay, this is, you know this is a little more intense so maybe this will work.  Well it did work for a short period of time and now it's not working.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT X352
But I need something.  I mean its gotten way out of hand.

DOCTOR X352
Anything make the pain worse?

PATIENT X352
Yeah too much activity, especially with the pets.  You know I've been doing some work in the yard.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
You know trimming hedges and things like that.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
There's a lot of bending and stooping.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And that does aggravate it.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
Very much so but I can't not do that.

DOCTOR X352
Right.

PATIENT X352
And @@@ I like it.

DOCTOR X352
Right.  Any other problems other than the pain that you've been having?

PATIENT X352
Uh no.  Uh I ran out of Plavix so I just went to baby aspirin.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
Uh they won't renew that.  There's a lot of the drugs they just won't renew them for me.  I don't know why I mean.

DOCTOR X352
So I never got, they usually send me an alert that uh you're out of meds and will I renew them for you.  So you called the Pharmacy and they just wouldn't renew them?

PATIENT X352
No I called the Pharmacy and they said oh you gotta come in so I made a trip in.  I talked to the pharmacist.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And he said oh there's not a prescription for it that's all, you got to get a prescription and so I made the appointment with you today because that's getting out of hand as well.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah I know.  I want you, but now I'll just @@@ you and so I want you on the Plavix so I'm renewing that right now.

PATIENT X352
And uh another question that I've had.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And I meant to ask you the last time I was here, so actually two more questions uh.

DOCTOR X352
Do you want them to mail this or pick it up at the window?

PATIENT X352
I'm gonna pick it up at the window.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
You know because I'm out of it.  I mean I've got nothing.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
You know.  The other medication that I'm taking for diabetes is pravastatin.  

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh and that was actually for cholesterol.  Pravastatin?

PATIENT X352
Uh pravastatin is for cholesterol, correct I'm sorry.

DOCTOR X352
No that's alright.

PATIENT X352
Uh I read in uh, on a medical website.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
That's actually put up by one of the universities, xxx xxx puts it up.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Um that that statin drug should be considered uh for switching off of it for a time period.  I've been on it for five or six years.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And the article informed me to the point of saying that after about four years it's not a bad idea to talk to your physician and find out if you should be taken off of that and put on something else.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
So that's what I'm doing now.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.  Um are you, have you been taking them?  When was the last time you took the pravastatin?

PATIENT X352
Oh last night.

DOCTOR X352
So you still have some.

PATIENT X352
Oh yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR X352
Let's look at your lipids now.

PATIENT X352
Yeah that was the other thing.  I never got results back from the two tests that they did the last time.  The urine and the uh blood draws.

DOCTOR X352
Well let's look at these first and then we'll look at that.  So.

PATIENT X352
I can't see that you know.

DOCTOR X352
Oh okay.  So your LDL cholesterol which is the bad cholesterol is 105.  For you, you have a lot of risk factors.  You've already had one stroke or TIA.

PATIENT X352
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X352
So I think your goal should be more strict so less than 100 to even less than 70.

PATIENT X352
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X352
So I would say that your cholesterol is not well controlled yet.  So I would be hesitant to let you have a break from the statin.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
When we don't even have your cholesterol under great control.

PATIENT X352
I understand okay.

DOCTOR X352
I mean if the article is very reasonable and that sometimes we just keeping pressing renew, renew, renew and then people have more and more meds and sometimes they needed one but now they don't um but.

PATIENT X352
Well that's exactly why I'm speaking to you about it.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah, no I think its important cause to make sure you really need what you're taking.

PATIENT X352
Right.

DOCTOR X352
Right.

PATIENT X352
Exactly.

DOCTOR X352
I think you do.

PATIENT X352
Okay.  No that's fine as long as your opinion of that, that's what we'll go with.  Um another thing that I wanted to bring up.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Is while I was still on Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Blue Cross/Blue Shield paid their part of my hospital bill.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Okay.  Now one of the reasons I wound up in the xxx xxx is because it was three minutes away from my home and I was having a stroke.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
I said I was a veteran and I had hospitalization here at the VA but they wouldn't drive me here.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
They just took me right there and started on me.

DOCTOR X352
Yep.

PATIENT X352
Um I spoke recently to a collection agency that I was turned over to because there was a nonpayment of $1500 on that bill.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And I said well, you know I've heard that the VA may take up a percentage of that which would lessen my cost.  I says number one I didn't even know I still owed you money.

DOCTOR X352
Right.

PATIENT X352
And the guy was very polite and very genuine as a human being.  He said well I'm gonna get you a detail of what the $1500 is going for.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
I know I owed Anesthesiology, was it you know Emergency Room, whatever.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And he said it could be just a bunch of combined things.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Where you know they got 80% from the insurance company on everything and then they just sort of reassessed it and said you know okay this adds up to this.

DOCTOR X352
Right.

PATIENT X352
Uh do you know the route that I have to take to inquire with the VA if they would pick up some of that?

DOCTOR X352
I do not, but I think uh maybe a social worker would be the place to start.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
Alright but let me talk with my attending and see if he has a different idea.  If not we'll set you up with the social worker and see if she can point you in the right direction.

PATIENT X352
Yeah.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
That would be great.

DOCTOR X352
Alright.  I wanted to go over what meds you are still taking.  Like are you taking the Timolol for eye pressure?

PATIENT X352
I need that too.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
Thanks for bringing that up because I would've walked out of here forgetting.  Yeah I've got three or four drops left in the bottle.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
So about three or four days worth.

DOCTOR X352
And how about the metformin?

PATIENT X352
Metformin yes, I've been on that, that's my diabetes medicine. 

DOCTOR X352
Are you taking that currently?

PATIENT X352
I am.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
Twice a day.  I believe the total dose is 500 mg or about 1000.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah twice a day of the 500 @@@.  Um what about the Wellbutrin or the bupropion?

PATIENT X352
I need that.

DOCTOR X352
You need that.

PATIENT X352
Yes if you could do that.

DOCTOR X352
How is the depression doing?

PATIENT X352
Actually it's a very, very strange type of @@@.  Uh there's some days that I find myself crying over joyful things.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Uh but that's not depression.  I don't know what they call it.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
You know I it's, it's so bizarre.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
You know if I see something that I'm really happy about I just start crying.

DOCTOR X352
So maybe some emotional uh labile emotions.

PATIENT X352
Oh that could be you know I mean.

DOCTOR X352
That can happen with depression.

PATIENT X352
Yeah I'm not saying that uh you know I've had a horrible load to haul.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
I've had a more difficult road to haul of late.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
You know losing my eyesight in 2009 and then you know my daughter's still a teenager, she's 19 and she moved to Florida.  Uh my wife's had two heart attacks.

DOCTOR X352
I know it's very tough.

PATIENT X352
And so you know I can see where I'd be a little pent up.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Legitimately I mean without making it some grander problem but as I was going into therapy uh I had to leave for Florida because my daughter fell into some really bad times there in Florida.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
So I left for Florida and I missed that whole appointment and when I got back I just never bothered to reappoint because what was being accomplished was very little um.  I think the psychologist wanted to, let's say take it from the beginning.  You know he wanted to try and delve into my life as from what I remember.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
All the way up to the present and so he of course is looking for treasures that might be going on now that relate to something in the past but I'll be very honest with you and I was very honest with him I says you know what, other than being in the military I've never had a traumatic experience.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
You know.  My mom was a stay-at-home mom.  My dad worked, he'd come home, we'd all eat dinner together.  I'd go out and play you know.  I mean I had such a normal childhood that it's not even funny.  It's just plain simple normal.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
You know and we were uh, we weren't impoverished but we were definitely not middle class either you know we were just above impoverished.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
Okay.  Uh but that made no difference to me.  I mean I started working when I was 16 and anything that I wanted I bought.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
You know.  A couple times I know I had to sign; my dad had to sign for me like when I bought my first car.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And even though I had the money you still needed a co-signer at that time because of my age.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
So that was done but you know before the military there was no traumatic experiences.  In the military there was traumatic experiences but they weren't the type that uh, I don't feel like I have that syndrome.

DOCTOR X352
PTSD?

PATIENT X352
Yeah I don't feel I have that.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
I don't know.  I mean I think that's what this guy was trying to get after.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
And just maybe that was something going on to, I have no idea but I just sort of lost my interest.

DOCTOR X352
Alright well.

PATIENT X352
Seriously.

DOCTOR X352
You know I'd encourage you that uh you keep up with the Mental Health okay, if you need it um and maybe if there's someone else that you can see.  But definitely if you're getting crying more, losing interest in activities, lack of appetite, can't sleep, any of those symptoms, let us know okay.

PATIENT X352
Yeah.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.  I'm gonna take a look in your eyes.

PATIENT X352
@@@.

DOCTOR X352
They're good.

PATIENT X352
You're not going to very successful on it.

DOCTOR X352
Hmm, there's a little @@@ that's alright.  Um.

PATIENT X352
Most people can't see my pupils anyway that's why I.

DOCTOR X352
I know.

PATIENT X352
My eyes just sort of.

DOCTOR X352
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X352
Yeah.

DOCTOR X352
Any interest in quitting?

PATIENT X352
There's always an interest in quitting.  It seems as though my interest wanes.  I had actually physically stopped for a week.

DOCTOR X352
That's good.

PATIENT X352
Um and that's exactly when I started the uh generic Wellbutrin.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
You know it helped a lot.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
Suppress the urge.

DOCTOR X352
It does uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Uh but then all these things started to break lose of course.  You know this always happens.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
Um my daughter got all crazy in Florida and I went out there and she's a heavy smoker.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And the first thing you know she's living with a heavy smoker so I just, go right back up.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
By the time I got home six weeks later I was smoking again.

DOCTOR X352
Well you know what my advice is gonna be right?

PATIENT X352
Well of course I do.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.  And what I'm saying alright.  Deep breath in, good again.  Alright excellent.

PATIENT X352
Yeah and it's really funny because I think the, probably the biggest psychological issue, quit smoking.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And I have this every pattern of test that I've had one on since October 4th of last year.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Certainly would've brought out even the slightest little defect in the lung capacity, in the heart, carotid artery.  I mean they did everything and it all came back great.  And it's that, my attending physician at the hospital said that he couldn't believe the condition I was in internally for what I'm doing to myself.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
So she says it's luck.

DOCTOR X352
Well I wouldn't take the risk.

PATIENT X352
I know there's also the risk factor that's gonna.

DOCTOR X352
Alright.

PATIENT X352
Jump up and grab you.

DOCTOR X352
Well I'd like to get some lab work on you.

PATIENT X352
@@@.

DOCTOR X352
At your convenience.  Did you get some today?

PATIENT X352
No not today.

DOCTOR X352
No.

PATIENT X352
But uh again the lab work that was performed the first time I though we were going to meet which was all the way back last year.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Um you did say see you in three months or because I came in October so I scheduled an appointment and then I came in and I didn't have it so.

DOCTOR X352
No.

PATIENT X352
And so but I never got results over the phone either.  All of the lab that they did at that time was probably back in November.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Maybe December.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.  Well I've looked over your labs.  It's hard for me to get back just because @@@.

PATIENT X352
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X352
Um but I want to redo some lab tests again today.  It looks like liver function hasn't been done in almost a year.  Uh and you @@@ and your lipid profile your creatinine we'll pick up and look at, something like your electrolytes and kidney function.

PATIENT X352
Okay well now that the weather's broken up and what it is, I'm gonna start walking again.  I don't know if I told you but I was walking on an average of six miles a day.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And I had actually taken down 15 pounds.

DOCTOR X352
That would be very good.

PATIENT X352
Yeah.  I just got to restart now cause everything's south.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.  I know you can do it. @@@.

PATIENT X352
Yes I'm anxious sometime down the line.  Like that one stroke that was very light.  One reason why I want to lose weight.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
And I didn't have a girlfriend and gained weight.

DOCTOR X352
Not @@@.  Well let me go talk with my attending.

PATIENT X352
Alright.

DOCTOR X352
And we'll talk about what uh, what to do for this pain okay.

PATIENT X352
Sure.

DOCTOR X352
Alright.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
See you back in just a few minutes.

PATIENT X352
Okay.  If he doesn't have any other suggestions you know the diclofenac would just have to be.

DOCTOR X352
Trust we've got a few more things we can try.

PATIENT X352
Good, as long they're not nonsteroidal.

DOCTOR X352
They are not too.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
@@@.

PATIENT X352
Cool.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:19  DOCTOR IN:  39:33)

DOCTOR X352
Alright.  So we're gonna try a medicine called tramadol.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
It's um a medicine that, it's a little bit stronger.

PATIENT X352
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X352
But it's not a narcotic.

PATIENT X352
Good.

DOCTOR X352
And it's not an NSAID and it's not uh a steroid.  It's just kind of it's only little.

PATIENT X352
Only little creature.

DOCTOR X352
Own little niche.

PATIENT X352
Okay.  Well that's fine.  As long as it's not a steroid or a narcotic I'll take it.

DOCTOR X352
Okay.

PATIENT X352
I would have a debate with you otherwise.

DOCTOR X352
Sounds good.

PATIENT X352
So if I'm suffering from depression and you really think I need a narcotic in my body, no.

DOCTOR X352
Agreed and talking with my attending he would like to get you into the Eye Clinic since I can't monitor the pressures in your eyes.

PATIENT X352
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X352
I'm not refilling the Timolol for you okay.

PATIENT X352
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X352
So uh I'm gonna have, refer that to the ophthalmologist, that way they can monitor it okay.

PATIENT X352
Sure.

DOCTOR X352
And then I'm gonna put in a consult to the social worker.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
And you should get a phone call about telling them, what you can talk to them about.

PATIENT X352
Okay is that.

DOCTOR X352
The medical bill.

PATIENT X352
That's good.  Because it just comes out to me, I don't know.

DOCTOR X352
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X352
Yeah again.  Had I been transported here.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
Uh, you know if it was something else.  Let's say I slipped and fell and broke my hip and they take me to the hospital well they would have brought me here but because of a stroke.  I guess they're directed to take you to the nearest facility.

DOCTOR X352
They are.

PATIENT X352
And since I live a mile exactly from @@@ Hospital.

DOCTOR X352
Alright.

PATIENT X352
Now these prescriptions now will be available downstairs?

DOCTOR X352
Yes.

PATIENT X352
And they're right?

DOCTOR X352
I hope.  We'll see you again in six months.

PATIENT X352
Are you gonna be here six months from now?

DOCTOR X352
Yep.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
I'll be here for two more years.

PATIENT X352
Oh really.

DOCTOR X352
Yep.

PATIENT X352
Oh wow.  I must have been on the back end of the last doctor's.

DOCTOR X352
Yep.

PATIENT X352
Round.

DOCTOR X352
Then yeah.  Alright oh and then the other thing for the pain I think, would you be willing to do physical therapy?

PATIENT X352
I would be willing to.  I don't know if it's going to do anything but I'd be willing to sure.  

DOCTOR X352
Let's do a trial of that and see if that helps you.

PATIENT X352
Yeah, why not?  I mean anything that'll help is well worth it.

DOCTOR X352
I like the attitude.

PATIENT X352
Yeah physical therapy, well yeah you know the physical therapy I was basically doing my own all my life until I had a baby.  My wife slimmed down and I just kept picking up.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
Once the baby was born, that was it, I don't know.  Cause I was working 16 hours a day most of the time and.

DOCTOR X352
It's hard isn't it?

PATIENT X352
Oh yeah.  And I was in upper level management so you know I was sitting on my butt for 14-16 hours every day.

DOCTOR X352
Yeah.

PATIENT X352
And I was eating junk food like it was going out of style.

DOCTOR X352
That'll do it.

PATIENT X352
Yeah.

DOCTOR X352
Do it for you won't it.

PATIENT X352
Yeah cause I was a manager when the @@@ occurred.

DOCTOR X352
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X352
It was more of a hobby but still.  I was @@@.

DOCTOR X352
Right, they should be calling you with this physical therapy appointment.

PATIENT X352
Okay so I got two calls to look forward to.

DOCTOR X352
Yep.

PATIENT X352
Alrighty, that sounds good.

DOCTOR X352
And lab work to do at your convenience.

PATIENT X352
Okay.

DOCTOR X352
And we'll be sure to send you a letter for this.

PATIENT X352
Okay.  So I think what I'll do is when I get a phone call from either of those two entities and they establish an appointment with me I'll just do my labs on the day of the appointment with them.

DOCTOR X352
That sounds like a plan.

PATIENT X352
And eat at the Commissary and do that.

DOCTOR X352
That sounds good.

PATIENT X352
Yeah, that's how I'll work it.

DOCTOR X352
Great.

PATIENT X352
Alright doctor, well I thank you very much.

DOCTOR X352

PATIENT X352

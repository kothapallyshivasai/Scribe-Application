DOCTOR X391 
PATIENT. 

PATIENT X391
Yes.

DOCTOR X391
Sorry about the wait.  I'm not your regular doctor.  I think you see DOCTOR.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Normally um.

PATIENT X391
Yep.

DOCTOR X391
Is there anything in particular you want to talk about today or is this kind for you still a regular follow-up?

PATIENT X391
Uh well I yeah I uh blood pressure.  Every time I come here it is like it's up.  Today it was 150, what was it 160 something and then she checked my right arm and it was 162.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
So it's always high and I'm on the, what is that listinol and also omeprazole and I don't know what's going on and why my pressure is up like that.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
And then at night uh during the day my feet swell.

DOCTOR X391
Your what swells?

PATIENT X391
My feet, both feet swell yeah and uh of course I prop them, sometimes I prop them up at night maybe not all the time but they seem to go down overnight but I don't know if @@@, I don't know.

DOCTOR X391
Sometimes as we age our veins aren't as strong.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
So the fact that you get them during the day and you lay down at night and you bring your leg up so the veins don't have to fight against gravity.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
The blood can flow back and that's very common.

PATIENT X391
Well okay.

DOCTOR X391
When you get older.  What do you do about it not much.  There are stockings, compression stockings you can wear to help during the day if you want to.  Some people think they're very uncomfortable.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
They kind of keep your, the pressure against the veins a little bit tighter so that they can't pool the blood there.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
And you have to move the blood back up.  That is an option if you want something like that.

PATIENT X391
Okay.  Yeah I wondered why my leg @@@ or something.  Uh I don't, you know it doesn't hurt or anything but I can feel them.  You like when I go to the washroom.

DOCTOR X391
Yes.

PATIENT X391
I can feel like I feel them swelling.

DOCTOR X391
Right.

PATIENT X391
You know and it just started um I don't know and it's just started since my pressure's been high.

DOCTOR X391
But your pressure's been high I think for quite a few times.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.  For more than a year, it's been up for a couple of years now and I just retired last February uh and I drove a bus, you know drive there and then wait eight hours a day so I thought that maybe I shouldn't let my feet swell after that well I noticed after we started finding my pressure high that's when I noticed the swelling you know.

DOCTOR X391
Let me ask you a few questions so we're on the same page because it's the first time I've seen you.  As far as I understanding some of the major issues that you have and doctors follow, you see the Rheumatology Clinic for your arthritis correct?

PATIENT X391
Right.

DOCTOR X391
Okay and you see the GI Liver Clinic.

PATIENT X391
Yes.

DOCTOR X391
Because you have a history of @@@.

PATIENT X391
Yeah and also like I say I cancer on my nose and knee surgery.

DOCTOR X391
@@@?

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.  They did surgery to remove cancer in my liver and also they gave me what they called a @@@, yeah I had two spots on my liver.  One they removed and then the other they did a @@@ on it, I forget what they called it where it's just something like a microwave that would kill the cancer that they think was there.  That was done on May 17th.

DOCTOR X391
Well after that you had a CT.

PATIENT X391
CT scan.

DOCTOR X391
You had a CT just recently in October.

PATIENT X391
Yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
But it looks like you have another mass in your liver.  Did anybody tell you that?

PATIENT X391
No.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
They told me everything was okay.

DOCTOR X391
Well you saw the Liver Clinic before that.  You saw the Liver Clinic on October 1st.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
And they said they'd order a CT for you just to make sure @@@.

PATIENT X391
Right yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Uh and I don't know if they called you.

PATIENT X391
Uh yes she called me then and uh I can't recall when she called me.

DOCTOR X391
Okay so I guess their interpretation of this is @@@ they did call you.  They're saying that it looks like a, almost like a bruise what we call a hemangioma on the liver.  But the radiologist said that it's a finding highly suggestive of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.

PATIENT X391
What does that mean?

DOCTOR X391
That means the cancer.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
What they're seeing on the CT means they're concerned of a recurrence of the cancer.  When DOCTOR called you her thought process, she talked to DOCTOR, I don't know who DOCTOR is, if that's the GI doctor, do you know DOCTOR?

PATIENT X391
DOCTOR he may be one of the GI doctors I can't remember his name.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah he'd be one of the liver doctors.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
So I think DOCTOR looked at it and thought it does not look like cancer that it looks like a pooling of blood there because of the surgery so from their standpoint I think she's trying to tell you she's not that concerned and just so you know what the official reading was you know.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR X391
So from their standpoint it's fine.  You will also have your every six month CT.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Um those I think are your biggest issues.

PATIENT X391
Hmm.

DOCTOR X391
Biggest issues correct?

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Uh right now I mean.

PATIENT X391
Right but on the other finding, the one that thinks that its cancer, somebody thinks that it's cancer.

DOCTOR X391
It's the same thing.  The same thing that they see the radiologist thought it looked maybe like cancer again.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
But the liver doctor looked at it and he thinks it's just probably there because you had the surgery.

PATIENT X391
Surgery okay.

DOCTOR X391
So that's what they think so I obviously would check with them cause they're the ones with the CTs.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
And they're the ones that are deciding on treatment for your care.  Um I don't think, you did not have any blood work today is that correct?

PATIENT X391
Yeah right.

DOCTOR X391
Um you're probably due for some blood work for the next time you see DOCTOR so I'll some like your cholesterol.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Your kidney disease.  Your blood pressure issue um do you ever get any chest pain?

PATIENT X391
No.  I have a pacemaker and uh sometimes I feel my heart beating and pulsating faster.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.

PATIENT X391
You know and I'm due for a pacemaker check and this one is on the 24th, the 24th of November this month cause they rescheduled it.  

DOCTOR X391
Okay my thought is that um you don't have an echo of your heart, that's the ultrasound of the heart for many years.  The last one was in 2000.  

PATIENT X391
Right.

DOCTOR X391
12 years ago.  Uh as we age the heart can get weaker and I know you have a pacemaker and that's good.

PATIENT X391
Right, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
But there are times when the heart can't pump out fluid as well so it backs up and can cause our legs to swell.  Can I see your legs?

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
If that's the issue there's a different medication that may help.  It's called Lasix.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Actually not that bad.

PATIENT X391
Good.

DOCTOR X391
So the type of edema that you see from a weak heart is different than what you have.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
You would be able to see my fingerprints in your legs.  So I think this is purely because of your veins and you're kind of correct in saying you're a bus driver cause you drive all day and you're pushing the pedals.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
You're exercising your calves.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
You're pushing blood back up in your veins when you stop.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
So that's actually pretty common to a lot of people can @@@.  So compression stockings would help.  I can send you those.  I don't think you need anything else right now.  There's another medication, a type of water pill, it makes you urinate a lot.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
It can help with the edema but I'm not sure that you really need that.

PATIENT X391
No I don't need that.  I uh, one reason I have incontinence, what is it continence?

DOCTOR X391
Incontinence.

PATIENT X391
Incontinence.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
Yeah I wear xxx clamp and it's my you know but I have to wear this thing 24 hours you to keep me from constantly urinating but to hold it in my bladder.

DOCTOR X391
Do you think you've have time to go pick up the stockings today?  Only because they would be able to measure how much pressure of the stocking they should give you?

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.  Um and they'll let you know where and he's in Building 228.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Have you been there?

PATIENT X391
Prosthetics?

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
Yeah I was over there for a few things.

DOCTOR X391
So I'll put the order in and you just go there after this.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Um and you can get them.  

PATIENT X391
I need something on my medication.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah let's go through them so.

PATIENT X391
And also this I haven't had for a while but I don't know if @@@ last year I think it was 2010, but I used it on my back and I have this fungus like.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.

PATIENT X391
And uh it went away but now it's back, you know it comes back again if I use that @@@.  So you got it the list.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah we'll talk about it.  And if they mail them to you that's okay?  To mail them?

PATIENT X391
Yeah that's okay.

DOCTOR X391
Okay so first on my list that I have for you of the medications that I'm giving you, you're taking fish oil.

PATIENT X391
Yeah the fish oil I have one refill left.

DOCTOR X391
Okay I'll make sure, you keep this I have it on the computer.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Then you have the hydrocodone Tylenol that's for pain?

PATIENT X391
Uh yeah I haven't been taking that.  They gave it to me when I was released from the hospital.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.

PATIENT X391
But uh.

DOCTOR X391
So you don't even have any refills on it.

PATIENT X391
That's and that's Vicodin.  That's Vicodin isn't it?

DOCTOR X391
Uh Norco, similar to Vicodin.

PATIENT X391
Yeah no I haven't taken that.

DOCTOR X391
I think I deleted so it probably should not be given to you.  So fish oil, that's Latanoprost eye drops are you using them?

PATIENT X391
Uh those yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Okay lisinopril every day?

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.

PATIENT X391
I use that yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Metoprolol half a tablet twice a day?

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.  Um omeprazole 20 mg every morning?

PATIENT X391
Omeprazole yeah right uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Um psyllium that's the packets.

PATIENT X391
Yeah I got two of those I just got some.

DOCTOR X391
Okay and then what is this Bactrim for?  The sulfamethoxazole.

PATIENT X391
What is that?

DOCTOR X391
It's an antibiotic.  It says take for seven days.

PATIENT X391
That's sulfamethoxazole?

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
Uh no that's what I was taking, DOCTOR I think put me on that sulfameth, one of the doctors did.

DOCTOR X391
Oh that's been a while.  Are you still taking that?

PATIENT X391
No, no.

DOCTOR X391
Are you sure?  You not taking it recently?

PATIENT X391
No.  I haven't if anything and I don't know I mean.

DOCTOR X391
I think she wanted you to be on that because you have so many UTIs.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
And that's why.  It's kind of a preventative measure for you.  She ordered that a while ago and you still have some active refills.  You haven't gotten it in over a year so you're not taking it but.

PATIENT X391
Yeah well maybe I should be taking it then; I didn't know that's what she wanted.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah I'm putting it on my notes she wanted that but I think that you're supposed to be on that and you have refills so when you don't get it mailed to you you have to call them and say that you need it.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
The Pharmacy.

PATIENT X391
Okay.  So will they mail it to me now?

DOCTOR X391
Um I can renew it and mail it but I don't know if she wants you to be on it cause you haven't gotten it in over a year.

PATIENT X391
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X391
So I'm gonna wait to see what she says.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Um, well let me renew it so you get one month's worth at least.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
If she changes her mind she can just order it.

PATIENT X391
Okay she can give me a call or something.

DOCTOR X391
Uh then you're on aspirin, full dose aspirin correct?

PATIENT X391
No I can't take aspirin anymore.  It starts my nose to bleed uh while I was taking it but I can't take it.  Potassium, potassium I haven't had that in a while but I would like to take that calcium with the vitamin D.

DOCTOR X391
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X391
It may be able to help my, my knee just feels like a bone on bone.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
You know I'm listening to them.  I had a cortisone shot last week, week before that @@@ and then at home the other day I was having pain and irritation and I was bending over and my knee felt, you know it didn't feel like it but I could hear it.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
Like bone on top of bone.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.  Yeah you probably do.  I think as we all age we get arthritis.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
That's probably happening.

PATIENT X391
That cartilage, there ain't no cartilage there.

DOCTOR X391
Yep, yep.  Um do you want the calcium vitamin D from here?

PATIENT X391
Yes.

DOCTOR X391
From the VA?

PATIENT X391
Yes right yeah.

DOCTOR X391
You're gonna need some a lot of blood work when you see DOCTOR next time okay.  So you need to go over there.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Even if nobody calls you and tells you to come over you should come in early and go to the Lab.

PATIENT X391
Okay.  Will do.

DOCTOR X391
So I think the vitamin D and the calcium we're gonna have to order separately.

PATIENT X391
Hmm.

DOCTOR X391
Um because otherwise they're not strong enough pills.

PATIENT X391
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X391
So by using 2000 what we call International Units.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
A day.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Calcium carbonate.  And you're taking steroids as well as prednisone?

PATIENT X391
No I stopped it.

DOCTOR X391
You're not taking those?

PATIENT X391
No I'm not taking anything.

DOCTOR X391
When was that stopped?

PATIENT X391
Uh last year or the year before, last year I think it was 2010.

DOCTOR X391
Are you still taking a multivitamin?

PATIENT X391
No 2011.  

DOCTOR X391
Are you still taking a multivitamin every day?

PATIENT X391
Uh sometimes, no I don't take it every day.

DOCTOR X391
So your calcium vitamin D for sure, I mean you don't necessarily @@@.  I'm just cleaning all of your medications up.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
To get rid of whatever we can.  Okay um and I don't have any @@@.  Let me see what it was back in October.  Okay I'm gonna have you have a seat up here so I can take a quick listen to your lungs.

PATIENT X391
You need me to take anything off?

DOCTOR X391
What's that?

PATIENT X391
Do I need to take my coat off?

DOCTOR X391
Oh no you're okay.  Open your mouth and say ah.

PATIENT X391
Okay look at my nose, look at my chin.

DOCTOR X391
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X391
Yeah you can put another out I got one.

DOCTOR X391
Deep breath through the mouth good.  Good.  Take a listen to your heart now.  Can I have you lay back?  Can I lift your shirt?

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh sure.

DOCTOR X391
What are all these scars from?

PATIENT X391
That's the.

DOCTOR X391
You've had a lot of surgeries.

PATIENT X391
The one going across this way.

DOCTOR X391
Yeah.

PATIENT X391
That's the liver surgery I had in May.  This one was a colon reversal.

DOCTOR X391
Hmm.

PATIENT X391
Basically just my colon.

DOCTOR X391
Can you take a deep breath okay good.  Lift your ankles from the floor.  Can I see the skin on your back that you were talking about?

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
I'm not sure this is fungus.

PATIENT X391
Hmm.

DOCTOR X391
Were you told that by a skin doctor before?

PATIENT X391
Yeah that's what I was using.  I was using it on a regular basis and then.

DOCTOR X391
It got better?

PATIENT X391
Uh yeah it got better.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.

PATIENT X391
It was over and I stopped using it and it came back.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.  We'll mail that to you.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
You can have it here.

PATIENT X391
Oh in the summer months it's just really, that's when it came back in the summer and uh I had it over and when I used it I had a bottle.  That bottle had some left in that one and I used it when it started getting bad again then I ran out.

DOCTOR X391
You said, you had all sort of urinary; you do have episodes of urinary incontinence correct?  You urinate without getting to the bathroom first?

PATIENT X391
Oh I what'd you say now?

DOCTOR X391
You just sometimes lose your urine without getting to the bathroom first?

PATIENT X391
Yeah even though I got this clamp on uh yeah it'll come if I don't rush, if I don't get there you know otherwise I'll lose it.

DOCTOR X391
And @@@ to ask all patients now is in the past two months have you been living in stable housing that you own, rent or stay in as part of a household?

PATIENT X391
Well I just stay and I rent.

DOCTOR X391
Okay cool.  Um are you worried or concerned in the next two months you may not have stable housing?

PATIENT X391
@@@.

DOCTOR X391
Okay and then have you had any falls recently?

PATIENT X391
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X391
So there's a screening for osteoporosis, I don't think you have this um it's called a DEXA scan and it basically is kind of like a big x-ray of the body to see how strong your bones are.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Um and it suggests if you're 84 that you would get that screening done, do you want that?

PATIENT X391
Yeah.  I'll get it.  At my age I just can't @@@.  I twisted my knee in 2011 @@@ birthday.  I tripped and I already I have a rod inside my left femur which I guess comes down almost just above my knee and I messed up the cartilage and the arthritis seems to be worse in this knee here but anyway uh.

DOCTOR X391
Do you have a history of a hip repair?  Did you have a hip repair?

PATIENT X391
No just the uh, well I've been in an automobile accident, this was in 89 in uh 1989 and I severed my artery and the muscle and broke the femur, left femur.  So he put a steel rod inside the femur but uh you know actually it doesn't bother me you know just the arthritis in the knee and then I twisted after my birthday on my birthday in 2011 and it's gotten worse.

DOCTOR X391
Hmm.

PATIENT X391
But otherwise you know it doesn't bother me.  That's the arthritis of course that's gonna be with me, I guess @@@.

DOCTOR X391
Okay so I have to quickly go talk with my attending about all the cases.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Uh basically we went through your medications.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
You will have a lot of blood work ordered for next time; you can get at the follow-up visit with DOCTOR.  She will likely call you back to let you know about that medication if you need to be on it for your UTIs, your urine infections.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Um @@@ treat it best mostly urine infections in the past.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Um and you'll get the scan whenever you, I think they'll try to either um schedule it for you or I think you can go down and get it today if that's okay if you have time you should walk in and get it whatever.

PATIENT X391
That's where they look at your bones?

DOCTOR X391
Yeah where they see how strong your bones are.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Um and then you can also go to Prosthetics today and pick up the stockings right and they'll measure and see how strong of a stocking you should be using.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Um.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X391
Throw these away right here?

DOCTOR X391
Yep.

DOCTOR OUT:  53:10  DOCTOR IN:  58:48

DOCTOR X391
Okay.  Sorry that took so long.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Alright so one thing the blood pressure issue.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
I think we have room to go up on your lisinopril.

PATIENT X391

Okay.

DOCTOR X391
It's the medication that's 5 mg I think DOCTOR had increased it last time as well.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Um you're taking one pill.  I would just increase the dose and take right now you're gonna start taking two pills starting tomorrow.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Of lisinopril.  Once you get the new bottles that pill should be stronger so you take one pill so it's gonna be 10 mg.

PATIENT X391
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X391
Okay it'll say it on the bottle.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
But overall you're gonna have twice as much of the lisinopril.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Which means that you need to come back here and get your blood pressure checked.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Uh with the nurse and obviously all the blood work that I ordered just get it done in about a month.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
So I'm gonna say lab one month.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
Then you need to come back for a nursing check in one month and I think we'll try to do it with DOCTOR's nurse that you follow up with all of that for the next time.

PATIENT X391
See the nurse during the same day right?

DOCTOR X391
What's that?

PATIENT X391
Can they do these two on the same day?  The lab and the nurse?

DOCTOR X391
Yeah well you down to the lab get your blood drawn because it's gonna be an active order but then the nurse, the blood pressure check you have to come back to the clinic.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
@@@ see how it's doing.  Ideally your medications should be taken for about 2-4 weeks before we can see the effect.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
So you get the new bottle and now whenever you get it you know you can finish out your old pills still.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Just take two of them.  Um and then you'll get the new bottle, you'll have to take blood work to make sure your potassium is fine cause sometimes @@@ go wrong with them.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
But you'll come back in and they'll want some blood work that day as well.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Okay so that's a lot of stuff but.

PATIENT X391
Yeah.

DOCTOR X391
I think we went through some medications and you will come back in a month because you're gonna increase your lisinopril so you're gonna come back to the hospital for blood work and check your blood pressure with the nurse.

PATIENT X391
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X391
After you're here today go to Prosthetic and get your stockings and whenever it is convenient for you you can get the DEXA scan.

PATIENT X391
What was it?

DOCTOR X391
That's just the scan that looks for osteoporosis in the body.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Or weak bones and that can be done at any time.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391
Go to Radiology and tell them you name.

PATIENT X391
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X391
It's totally up to you, whatever your day is looking like.  You can come later and there's no rush.

PATIENT X391
Oh okay, I'll check down there today and if I can get it @@@.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.  Yeah.  Maybe it won't be @@@.

PATIENT X391
Oh right right yeah.

DOCTOR X391
Okay.  Actually through the checkout counter.

PATIENT X391
Okay.

DOCTOR X391

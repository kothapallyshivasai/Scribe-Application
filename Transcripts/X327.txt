DOCTOR X327

PATIENT X327
One more month.

SECOND PERSON X327
I can't imagine.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah grab a seat.

PATIENT X327
Oh.

DOCTOR X327
Just about there.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
You know I'm looking forward to it a little bit.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
But it's scary.

PATIENT X327
That's okay.  
SECOND PERSON X327
You're jumping.

PATIENT X327
Oh it'll be alright.

DOCTOR X327
How are things going for you?

PATIENT X327
Pretty good.  I got my little quirks.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.  Pain here and there.

DOCTOR X327
Any problems?  Sleep well?  Any kind of problems?

PATIENT X327
No, no big problems, except every so often my ankle hurts right here.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.

PATIENT X327
Right there.

DOCTOR X327
What do you do when it hurts?  Like elevate it or?

PATIENT X327
I don't know it just comes and goes.

DOCTOR X327
You ever hurt it before?

PATIENT X327
Not that I can remember.

DOCTOR X327
Do any exercising or anything?

SECOND PERSON X327
Only walking around the house.

DOCTOR X327
Okay, walking around.  I mean the only thing we kind of do for that, do you take anything for it to help?

PATIENT X327
Uh well I got some medicine Naproxen and that @@@.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah probably Naproxen.

PATIENT X327
Yeah that and my wife, she rubs it and washes it with a liniment, like a liniment and it gets better.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.  You probably just have some strain on the ligaments and everything.

PATIENT X327
Right it's just like a little pain that comes.

DOCTOR X327
It comes up here?

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
It's probably a little strain in the muscle.  Does it seem to be on the outside?

PATIENT X327
Yeah like right, right in here.

DOCTOR X327
There's a kind of strain where you're pushing your down and you're using these muscles.

PATIENT X327
Oh.

DOCTOR X327
And so usually the muscles on the outside of the ankle.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Pushing down like that so.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
The one thing to do is just you know keep exercising the ankle movement around.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
And don't overwork it too much.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Heating pads and stuff will help with that.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Well and I mean and I'll take a look at it just to make sure there's nothing swollen in there or anything.

SECOND PERSON X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Um, anything else?  Have you been checking your sugars?

PATIENT X327
Yeah.  I've been doing that steady you know.

DOCTOR X327
Oh right yeah.

PATIENT X327
@@@ every day, especially when I can't sleep.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  Um how do they look at home?

SECOND PERSON X327
They look good.  @@@.

DOCTOR X327
So when do you check them?

PATIENT X327
Uh in the mornings and before I eat.

DOCTOR X327
What have they each been?

PATIENT X327
Uh it depends on @@@ at night.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah and in the morning?

PATIENT X327
124, 27 you know.

DOCTOR X327
So 120s that's pretty good.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Any low ones?

PATIENT X327
Uh in the morning no.  I've had a few high ones like in the 150 range.

DOCTOR X327
That's still not too bad so that's good.

PATIENT X327
But after I take the medicine you know it's back to 130, 12 goes down to like 116, 107.

DOCTOR X327
So it's pretty good.  So you're keeping in a good range and how about the blood pressure?

PATIENT X327
Uh blood pressures range from like 130 you know, the bottom like 78 and heart rate, the heart rate always seems a little high.

DOCTOR X327
@@@.

PATIENT X327
Yeah about 93, 98 just had a long trip.

DOCTOR X327
Any reason why it's so fast?

PATIENT X327
You mean.

DOCTOR X327
No chest pain, shortness of breath?

SECOND PERSON X327
No not really.  

PATIENT X327
It usually go up whenever I do my inhaler you know.

DOCTOR X327
Okay that's why.  The inhaler makes it a little fast that makes sense yeah.

PATIENT X327
Right.  @@@.

DOCTOR X327
It speeds you up.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
It @@@ should.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Alright.  So all the meds here, you're still taking the metformin?

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
And the lisinopril, amlodipine.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Niacin?

PATIENT X327
Yeah.  I'm taking every damn thing.

DOCTOR X327
We gave you more than enough so.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
So his blood pressure is good today.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Really well-controlled, better than even before.  Pulse is high still.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
We'll recheck that.  Okay.  How is that knee?

PATIENT X327
Uh it's doing pretty good.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.

PATIENT X327
Yeah, seems like it leaves one area and go into another area.  @@@ and that wasn't a normal thing it's, just had a pain and that's normal but shit what can you do?  @@@.  

DOCTOR X327
Well I know we tested a bunch of labs @@@.

PATIENT X327
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X327
And I remember that they all came back normal so @@@.

PATIENT X327
Didn't I get an x-ray or something?

DOCTOR X327
You did like x-ray and that was okay.  Your iron was okay, we checked that.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
And you know everything else here, your thyroid looks okay so I don't think there's any like any cause for, so you probably did something like first @@@ and it happens sometimes you don't even.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
So today there's nothing prominent.  When was the last time you saw the eye doctor?  In October?  Remember that?

PATIENT X327
I think so.  Yeah that's it.

DOCTOR X327
And your level was not too bad.  Your A1c level was good, it was 7.2.  Now I want it below 7.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
So that's not bad.

PATIENT X327
What's that fellow when I called in for my shoes?

DOCTOR X327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X327
They asked me did I know my A1c.

DOCTOR X327
Oh they asked you, that's the one you want to know.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
7.2 so.

PATIENT X327
7.2 and they want it below 6 right?

DOCTOR X327
Well closer to, probably under 6.5 would be best.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
I'd be happy to get you under 7.

PATIENT X327
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR X327
So I mean, you're almost there and you're not on a ton of meds so.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
I mean we could probably let it go up a little bit.  I mean I think the way your sugars are looking and how's the diet and exercise doing?

SECOND PERSON X327
Good.

PATEITN X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah so you been losing weight, the same.

SECOND PERSON X327

DOCTOR X327
Pretty good.  So he's losing a little?

SECOND PERSON X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Pretty similar to last time.

PATIENT X327
I've stopped eating a lot.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X327
We diet @@@.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.  Cause I got to @@@

DOCTOR X327
So that's how it's working?

PATIENT X327
Yeah I got do another @@@.  Sometimes I tell you I can't eat nothing.

DOCTOR X327
Oh all the good stuff you can't eat.

PATIENT X327
Yeah, like fried chicken, cause that's hard.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah, it hurts too much.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X327
Go ahead.

DOCTOR X327
Oh no just stay where you're at.

SECOND PERSON X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Eat today already?

PATIENT X327
Yeah I ate.  I went for blood work.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  So did they check your cholesterol?

PATIENT X327
Right yeah did the blood work.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.

PATIENT X327
They called me and told me to come in and check my @@@.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  It should be here.

PATIENT X327
@@@.

DOCTOR X327
It's still a little high.

PATIENT X327
Oh they did it already?

DOCTOR X327
Yep.  So we might need to uh, let's see.  Are you taking the um simvastatin, you're taking it?

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
And you're taking the niacin.

PATIENT X327
Niacin.  I don't really keep track of that one.

DOCTOR X327
Okay try and take it daily so I don't have to.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X327
One time when he took that pill.

DOCTOR X327
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X327
The other night he was burning and he was burning and he said my skin's on fire.

DOCTOR X327
I can give you something for that.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Usually the xxxadryl or using an aspirin before you take it.

SECOND PERSON X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
So you take aspirin anyway right?

SECOND PERSON X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Baby aspirin at night like when you're going to take the niacin.  So take the aspirin a little before you take that pill.

PATIENT X327
Oh okay, like 81 mg.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X327
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X327
So if you take that before it should help. So when you take the aspirin.

PATIENT X327
That scared the shit out of me.

PATIENT X327
Right and I like to know, hearing these reports about @@@ about testosterone.

DOCTOR X327
Yes.

PATIENT X327
So um now um I was been on the computer and found that.  Like I don't seem like I don't want my, you have to want desire for sex or whatever.

DOCTOR X327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X327
And that's one of the reason low testosterone.

DOCTOR X327
Right.

PATIENT X327
Is there a something for that?

DOCTOR X327
There is but it's something I don't like to check because I'll tell you the reason because giving testosterone has it’s own risk, it hurts your liver you know.

PATIENT X327
Oh really.

DOCTOR X327
It can do a lot of different things.  It changes your sugar levels.

PATIENT X327
Oh.

DOCTOR X327
It'll do @@@ at the same time, so like the prostate.  So if
you're older obviously there's an increased risk of prostate cancer.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
I think it's probably good that they advertise and we don't know who really has that.

PATIENT X327
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X327
So I don't recommend it unless like you're getting really fatigued, it's like maybe you know it's like you're getting more like your hair like on the arms falling out.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
You're developing breasts then I would think oh you don't have testosterone you know.

PATIENT X327
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X327
But like @@@ you know for low energy I wouldn't recommend it because of all the risks and benefits.

PATIENT X327
Cause that's just a bunch of hype.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah I mean we could check it but even if it was low and nothing was right.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
You may be low, there's no @@@.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
You know we'd have to keep it low.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
I would be, I mean it's something we can look into.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
I mean as you get older, you lose a little bit of desire.  Do you have any trouble getting erections or anything?

PATIENT X327
Uh, kind of, sort of.

DOCTOR X327
Oh yeah, sometimes.

PATIENT X327
Sometimes it still works, sometime it don't.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  Well then we'll do something.

PATIENT X327
Yeah I got a wife that's 10 years younger than me so she @@@.

DOCTOR X327
She wants you to do well.  @@@.

PATIENT X327
That's alright.  I think it's um we'll have to get her a toy.  Hey whatever does it?  Right.

DOCTOR X327
But I guess the question is you know is there anything else that could be contributing and like how's your sleep been?

PATIENT X327
Uh that's kind of shitty at times.

DOCTOR X327
What happens? Do you wake up?  

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Do you think you snore or are you short of breath or anything?

SECOND PERSON X327
No.

PATIENT X327
I goes to bed 9-9:30, go to sleep and I wake up.  If I don't take a Advil P.M. I wake up like 2 o'clock.

DOCTOR X327
Why are you waking up?  What's going on?

PATIENT X327
I don't know.  I just wake up.

DOCTOR X327
Are you tired @@@.

SECOND PERSON X327
No, uh uh.  I say what's up.

PATIENT X327
What. 

DOCTOR X327
Huh.  Can you go back to sleep?

PATIENT X327
Yeah maybe after a while I go back to sleep.

DOCTOR X327
Are you tired during the day?

PATIENT X327
No I don't really do shit.  It's just that I wake up, I don't know why.

SECOND PERSON X327
I don't know why either yeah.

PATIENT X327
I wake up, I'm thinking on things that are important you know, crazy.

DOCTOR X327
Have been anxious?

PATIENT X327
What?

DOCTOR X327
Have you been anxious?

PATIENT X327
Sometimes I do get a little anxious.

DOCTOR X327
With worries about what?  Any in general?

PATIENT X327
Yeah, just thinking about overall affairs.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.

PATIENT X327
Just you know crazy shit.  How's the money going to last you know, I know, you know like and if I take an Advil P.M. I sleep good.

DOCTOR X327
I don't recommend probably continuing to do that.

PATIENT X327
Why?

DOCTOR X327
You know when you can.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Now all we're going is @@@.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
If you feel like you're gonna wake up or you're having trouble, just take it before you go to bed.

PATIENT X327
It's like a half a pill you know.

DOCTOR X327
Good you know I mean I think it's real easy but I can give you a different medicine that might help with your @@@ problem.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
And if you feel maybe, you know another thing I think having a younger lady, do you feel pressure?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
Any pressure to like perform?

PATIENT X327
No she's understanding.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  

PATIENT X327
@@@.

DOCTOR X327
You get worked up and you want to do it and when you want to do it so bad you can't.

PATIENT X327
I know sometimes I see @@@.

DOCTOR X327
Hmm.

PATIENT X327
She's going through menopause.

DOCTOR X327
Hmm.

PATIENT X327
Man she can get real crazy.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.

PATIENT X327
@@@.  These little things, you know it's sad you know.  @@@.

DOCTOR X327
I think around menopause is probably the worst.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Cause the woman knows what's happening.

PATIENT X327
Is that worse than menopause?

SECOND PERSON X327
Not really um.

DOCTOR X327
You @@@ kind of go slowly.  It's not like how you where you just shut off.

SECOND PERSON X327
Right, right.

DOCTOR X327
Like a slow drop so over time you know it's like obviously testosterone is @@@ talking about.

SECOND PERSON X327
Right, right.

DOCTOR X327
Not really and that's how you, unless you're, I'm not sure if it totally fails but when it fails you want to go to @@@.

PATIENT X327
Right okay.  Yeah I guess I just have to, @@@, get all the memories.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.  Well you know it's something I would think about checking from.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
If you really want, if you're really concerned about, how often can you get an erection?  Do you wake up with erections?

PATIENT X327
No not really.

DOCTOR X327
No.

PATIENT X327
I don't know even @@@.

DOCTOR X327
No, not anymore.

PATIENT X327
That's what I say is it supposed to drop like that?

DOCTOR X327
How quickly does it fall off, I mean fall away?

PATIENT X327
Um rapidly.

DOCTOR X327
Like all the time?

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Well I think you know, part of that is getting the diabetes under control.

PATIENT X327
Right.

SECOND PERSON X327
Yeah.

PATIENT X327
The medicines.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah.  Now that your sugars are getting pretty good.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
I think that's gonna help.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
And now the blood pressures even looks a little better.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
So the only thing that I would say that I think will help rather than the testosterone is you know getting around and like walking.

PATIENT X327
Exercising.

DOCTOR X327
Get the blood flowing.  The biggest problem is the blood flow.

PATIENT X327
Right, right.

DOCTOR X327
I doubt if its testosterone but we know @@@ shortness of breath.

PATIENT X327
Yeah okay doc.

DOCTOR X327
I knew you did.  So I wouldn't worry about it.

PATIENT X327
Right okay.

DOCTOR X327
So I think you'll be okay.

PATIENT X327
Alright.

DOCTOR X327
Get moving.  Anything that gets the blood flowing is good.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Into the blood flow.

PATIENT X327
Okay.  I know I went out of town and I work, you know, I was in clothing @@@ and sent people to help me.

DOCTOR X327
Oh.

PATIENT X327
I worked every day.

SECOND PERSON X327
And I @@@ weather.

DOCTOR X327
That's really good.

PATIENT X327
After working you know so hard and all of that, I start feeling better though.  So I got to start exercising.

DOCTOR X327
You need to do that.

PATIENT X327
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Well you got to do it then.

PATIENT X327
Right, okay.

DOCTOR X327
So maybe that's the main thing.  I don't think you have any medications that are causing a problem and I'm just looking here.  Yeah you don't have any medications that should interfere.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
That would be another thing I'd check.

PATIENT X327
Don't the water pills do that?  The water pill?

DOCTOR X327
They shouldn't no.  Everything else looks good.  

SECOND PERSON X327
@@@.

DOCTOR X327
I need to do an exam on you and you already got all your labs done.  They look obviously the cholesterol is still a little high.  Not where I want to see the bad cholesterol, the 128.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
I want that under 100 but if you take the niacin.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
That might help.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Just take the aspirin before.  Cholesterol's okay.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Not where we want it to be, it's just a little high triglycerides but that will go down when the diabetes is under better control, reasonably better so.  @@@ before and your blood looks fine, nothing worrisome.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
So that's about it.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Let me do a quick exam on you.  I'll go talk with the other doc and we'll get you out of here.  Do you need anything else?

PATIENT X327
Uh no I'm good.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.

PATIENT X327
It's all good.

DOCTOR X327
When did you take your inhaler last?

PATIENT X327
Uh let's see @@@.

DOCTOR X327
Okay I think it's been fast but nothing.  Did you walk around a lot before you got here?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  You don't feel short or breath, chest pain?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  Nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
You've been taking them with liquid?

PATIENT X327
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X327
No fevers, chills?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
Coughing up anything?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
Pain when you urinate?

PATIENT X327
Uh what?

DOCTOR X327
Any pain when you urinate?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
Okay.  You are actually just a little bit fast.  I'm making you nervous.

PATIENT X327
@@@.  You put me on the spot doc.

DOCTOR X327
Take a deep breath.  Again.  Any pain here?

PATIENT X327
No.

DOCTOR X327
Can I take a look at your feet?

PATIENT X327
Yeah sure.

DOCTOR X327
@@@.  Alright.

PATIENT X327
@@@.

DOCTOR X327
Is that right.  You don't want them too moist anyway.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
With diabetes.  So you got some feeling along through here?

PATIENT X327
Yes.  I had um surgery on that @@@.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah what'd you have done there?

PATIENT X327
I had like a hammertoe and.

DOCTOR X327
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X327
About a year or less.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.  It's hanging my belt in that joint @@@.

DOCTOR X327
Better now?

PATIENT X327
Yeah it got kind of dark you know and they cut that joint up.  They broke that bone, put a pin in it and straightened it out.

DOCTOR X327
They chopped out a lot?

PATIENT X327
What?

DOCTOR X327
They chopped out a lot?

PATIENT X327
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X327
Do you have feeling here?

PATIENT X327
Yes.

DOCTOR X327

PATIENT X327
Right.  No I'm really @@@.

DOCTOR X327
Oh they look good.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
@@@.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
Oh they want me to screen everyone for HIV.  I mean you already had labs drawn today.  I'll just say we'll do it next time.

PATIENT X327
Okay.  Yeah I think I'm straight.  But you're young.

DOCTOR X327
They tell you to do it for everyone.

PATIENT X327
Yeah okay, okay.

DOCTOR X327
So but I suppose we could take it today.  @@@.

PATIENT X327
Alright.

DOCTOR X327
And you had your c-scope four to five years ago.

PATIENT X327
Right.  

DOCTOR X327
I got it all set up.

PATIENT X327
What the?

DOCTOR X327
Oh the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X327
Oh.

DOCTOR X327
Everything else looks okay.  You said the @@@ is better.  Normal.  Everything else is normal.  Alright let me talk with the other doc.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
And I think, yeah no big changes.  Just we'll try that niacin okay.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
I'll be back in a moment.

PATIENT X327
And that aspirin won't let me get the burns huh?

DOCTOR X327
It'll help.  If it doesn't work we can try a full dose aspirin.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
The 3.5 and you can try that and that should help prevent it at least.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Either that and if that doesn't work xxxadryl.

PATIENT X327
Oh xxxadryl.

DOCTOR X327
Yeah sometimes that works.  That's what's in the Tylenol P.M. anyway.

PATIENT X327
Right.

DOCTOR X327
So take it before bed.

PATIENT X327
Yeah.

DOCTOR X327
And it works like Tylenol P.M., it'll work.

PATIENT X327
Okay.

DOCTOR X327
Try it with the aspirin first.

PATIENT X327
Okay.  Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:23  DOCTOR IN:  52:33)

DOCTOR X327
Alright one change.

PATIENT X327

DOCTOR X159
Come on back.

PATIENT X159
Okay.

DOCTOR X159
How you doing?  Good to see you.  What's new?  What's new?

PATIENT X159
What's new?  I got a sore throat.

DOCTOR X159
You got a sore throat huh?

PATIENT X159
Yeah overnight.  Something that and I got a back aches every morning.  I was here a month ago.

DOCTOR X159
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X159
And I had a different doctor, you weren't available I guess so.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.

PATIENT X159
Anyway uh, the hardest part is in the morning when I get up.

DOCTOR X159
Backache?

PATIENT X159
It's above the back and it goes from both sides.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.  What did they do when they saw you?

PATIENT X159
They took an x-ray.

DOCTOR X159
A what?

PATIENT X159
X-ray.

DOCTOR X159
Of what?

PATIENT X159
Of my hip and my back and uh at the time I told them I think that I had taken Advil but it was Aleve.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.

PATIENT X159
So he says to take one in the morning and one at night.  Well I stopped doing that after a while and the last three, four nights now I take one Aleve in the evening, you know at bedtime.

DOCTOR X159
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X159
Well.

DOCTOR X159
Does it help?

PATIENT X159
Uh well, it appears to be a little bit, but the hardest part.  During the day I can live with it.

DOCTOR X159
So a little huh.

PATIENT X159
It doesn't affect me during the day but the hardest part is getting up, when I get up in the morning, just out of bed.

DOCTOR X159
Um do you have any sort of aching, do you have aching in the morning?

PATIENT X159
It hurts.

DOCTOR X159
@@@.

PATIENT X159
It's the side and it's been on both sides.  It'll go from one side to the other.

DOCTOR X159
Now is this in the same place you have here because you had that surgery done about six years ago.

PATIENT X159
Yes.

DOCTOR X159
Is it in the same spot?

PATIENT X159
I don't think so, I thought that was on, this is more on like now, the last couple days it's on the right side and I did come in for the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR X159
Let's see we had little, well they checked your urine and that was fine.  You're having no problems urinating right?

PATIENT X159
Correct.

DOCTOR X159
And then no fever or chills?

PATIENT X159
Nope.

DOCTOR X159
Now, hold on one second.  So what you were just saying, you had your colonoscopy.

PATIENT X159
Yes I did.

DOCTOR X159
When was that done?

PATIENT X159
A month ago, well maybe a little more.  A month ago I was seen here for the back so, maybe two months.

DOCTOR X159
Two months.

PATIENT X159
I'm not positive but.

DOCTOR X159
Uh-huh. 

PATIENT X159
Shortly after you arranged for it.

DOCTOR X159
Now you said that the back issues, they started about a month ago?

PATIENT X159
It started in July really, 4th of July.

DOCTOR X159
So you get back pain on the side.  Talk to me, show me where it is.

PATIENT X159
It's right in here.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.

PATIENT X159
It's not directly in the back.

DOCTOR X159
Did you recently, were you lifting things, were you doing anything like that, nothing new?

PATIENT X159
Nothing out of the ordinary.

DOCTOR X159
Worse in the morning but it goes away by the end of the day?

PATIENT X159
During the day I'm fine, it doesn't affect me.

DOCTOR X159
So when you wake up how long does it last for?

PATIENT X159
Uh till I get in gear.  I sit.

DOCTOR X159
So about an hour, two hours, how long?

PATIENT X159
Oh ten minutes, maybe even less.  But it's the idea of getting up.

DOCTOR X159
Yeah.

PATIENT X159
Sitting up and then and trying to get up because it hurts just getting up into a sitting position.

DOCTOR X159
You have no problems specifically getting up?

PATIENT X159
No except for the pain of the back, inside the back or whatever you want to call it.  But it has seemed to alleviate a little bit.

DOCTOR X159
No numbness or tingling in your legs or your hands?

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
And then no loss of bowel or bladder?

PATIENT X159
Nope.

DOCTOR X159
No weight loss?

PATIENT X159
I don't believe so.  I may have lost two or three pounds.

DOCTOR X159
Nothing big.

PATIENT X159
Nothing.

DOCTOR X159
No night sweats?

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
You said no fever or chills.

PATIENT X159
Correct.

DOCTOR X159
No nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT X159
No sir.

DOCTOR X159
Okay and then um right now you would have no problems turning, walking?

PATIENT X159
No, no.  Uh the hips are beginning to have a little pain in them when I start walking, you know when I walk.  I mean I would walk without no problem and now my hips, both of them, are kind of sore.

DOCTOR X159
Um and then does the medication you're taking help?

PATIENT X159
It seems to have helped somewhat.  I was going to ask you, which would you recommend, Aleve, Advil, Tylenol or which?

DOCTOR X159
Now do you have any problems with your stomach?

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
Um typically if this is just for arthritis um, you know you have a history of lower back pain, osteoporosis, so this could just be degenerative.  But let me look at the films real quick.  If it's just that I would recommend probably anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen.  But you've never had any bleeds?

PATIENT X159
Bleeding?

DOCTOR X159
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
Um if you have then we can recommend another type.  But you've never had any stomach problems?

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
Or you don't have any heart problems or kidney problems right?

PATIENT X159
I hope not, not to my knowledge anyway.

DOCTOR X159
Yeah.  And you just have, you have hypertension and gout, uh high blood pressure.  Okay you don't seem to have any of the other ones.  You're just on the simvastatin, lisinopril, folic acid um vitamin B12, the alendronate and the aspirin and calcium right?

PATIENT X159
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X159
Take a look at the x-ray, spine and lumbar.  Worsening compression deformity, extensive degenerative changes with a lot of osteophytes.  Okay.  Well basically what that means is you have quite a bit of um, quite a bit of degenerative changes.  My guess is those degenerative changes, in which case the anti-inflammatory should work the best, so ibuprofen.  How much ibuprofen have you been taking?

PATIENT X159
I haven't.  This Aleve.

DOCTOR X159
Why not?  Oh you're taking Aleve?

PATIENT X159
Well I've taken it the last three to four days.  I've taken Aleve one at night.

DOCTOR X159
That's it?  Oh you can take.

PATIENT X159
Well.

DOCTOR X159
Uh take it in the morning when you wake up.  Cause when you go to sleep it's just going to wear off in a few hours and when you wake up, let's say if you're having problems in the morning then um.

PATIENT X159
But then during the day I don't have any problems.

DOCTOR X159
Then don't take any during the day.  You only take them when you have problems.  So I would say only take them when you notice that you have some problems there okay.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT X159
So the only problem I have is when I get up, like I say.

DOCTOR X159
Right, yeah I think, so what I would say is when you get up, maybe take them when you get up and then if you don't have any symptoms during the day then great.

PATIENT X159
I don't have it without the pill in the morning.  

DOCTOR X159
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X159
I only take it at night thinking that in the morning it might be better.

DOCTOR X159
Sure.  Well yeah, exactly.  In the morning um, when you have the pain that's when you take the medicine.

PATIENT X159
Okay.

DOCTOR X159
In other words take the medicine when you have pain.

PATIENT X159
Alright.

DOCTOR X159
Does that make sense?

PATIENT X159
Sure.

DOCTOR X159
Okay, let's see here.  Let's see the last time, so I actually saw you in June.

PATIENT X159
Well you told me you wanted to see me in three months.

DOCTOR X159
Yeah no I was just trying to remember when the last time was that I saw you.

PATIENT X159
And since then I came in for the colonoscopy and then I came in for.

DOCTOR X159
Oh great.

PATIENT X159
Because of my back pain problem.

DOCTOR X159
And what else and you had just recently been diagnosed with diabetes?

PATIENT X159
I have?

DOCTOR X159
No back then.

PATIENT X159
If I have, I haven't been told.

DOCTOR X159
What's that?  Well no we told you that you had recently high blood sugars right?

PATIENT X159
Well the last time I came here you asked for a blood test and a urine test.

DOCTOR X159
Correct.

PATIENT X159
That was the last; I'm not taking anything for diabetes.

DOCTOR X159
Right.  Well this one the idea is in your hemoglobin A1c was how we measure your potential diabetes.  Your hemoglobin A1c was 5.9 which is really good.  Let me look at the old one because let me just take a quick look at.  I think one of your labs was off and then we rechecked it and your hemoglobin A1c was 5.9, that's really good.  You're spilling some protein in your urine which was um, let's go over this.  So that was fine.  Your kidney function is doing okay.

PATIENT X159
And you know you had me here taking the eye test, I did that two or three times when I came in to that and they told me to come back in a year.

DOCTOR X159
And we checked your, let's see we checked your cholesterol in November of 09.  Your total was 177, your HDL was 75 and your LDL, yeah so your cholesterol looks really good.  See the sugars that we took were high but your hemoglobin A1c was okay, so I think we won't, basically we're just not going to start you on anything but you're kind of on the borderline of diabetes.

PATIENT X159
Okay.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.  Okay, okay and then um we talked about the colonoscopy and you ended up getting it.

PATIENT X159
Correct.

DOCTOR X159
And the good news is you don't need to get any more.

PATIENT X159
Wonderful.

DOCTOR X159
What's that?

PATIENT X159
Wonderful.

DOCTOR X159
Was it uh.

PATIENT X159
No it wasn't bad.  I mean the worst part is before.

DOCTOR X159
You had a little external hemorrhoids, that's about it, so diverticulosis, okay.  And let's looks at your immunizations.  You should probably be up on your immunizations.

PATIENT X159
Is the flu shot in already?

DOCTOR X159
Not yet unfortunately.  For some reason we don't have the flu shot.  Now do you want the zoster vaccine, remember we talked about it last time?

PATIENT X159
What is that one for?

DOCTOR X159
For when, or if you were to get the shingles.

PATIENT X159
I took that, I had that, I did get that shot.

DOCTOR X159
Oh you did?

PATIENT X159
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X159
Oh it was the Pneumovax right.

PATIENT X159
Yeah that I got.

DOCTOR X159
Okay, oh no you need the zoster and you just got the pneumonia one.  You need the zoster one for the shingles.

PATIENT X159
I thought it was for the shingles.

DOCTOR X159
When was that?

PATIENT X159
I don't know, at least a year ago if not longer.

DOCTOR X159
I really don't have it in here.

PATIENT X159
Because.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.

PATIENT X159
Because I think.

DOCTOR X159
At least you think you got it.

PATIENT X159
You told me that uh if you do get it, it shouldn't be as severe as.

DOCTOR X159
Exactly and you think you've gotten it.

PATIENT X159
I have gotten it.

DOCTOR X159
Huh.  I wonder why it doesn't show it.

PATIENT X159
I had one done.

DOCTOR X159
You said you've already had one okay.  Well did you have some back pain right there?

PATIENT X159
Not really, it's just, that's the way I get up now.

DOCTOR X159
Why is that?

PATIENT X159
Oh well, old age I call it, I don't know.  But there have, in the past, like when I came here a month ago to see the other docs, I mean I had a hard time getting up.  It was really painful.

DOCTOR X159
You hadn't, you did do, no lifting.

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
Or nothing like that.

PATIENT X159
And it's, now like I said it has subsided considerably.

DOCTOR X159
But no weight loss?

PATIENT X159
Not to speak of.

DOCTOR X159
Okay and no night sweats and you're eating well?

PATIENT X159
Yes.  Maybe too much.

DOCTOR X159
You're eating well.  What's that?

PATIENT X159
Maybe too much.

DOCTOR X159
Maybe too much?

PATIENT X159
Right.  

DOCTOR X159
Okay, I'll take a listen to you.

PATIENT X159
You want the shirt off or?

DOCTOR X159
Um, no I can do it.

PATIENT X159
Okay.

DOCTOR X159
What do you do for uh, what did you do for a living?

PATIENT X159
I worked at the lumber yard.

DOCTOR X159
Oh that's right.

PATIENT X159
For 32 years.

DOCTOR X159
Right.

PATIENT X159
And then I was the equipment man at the high school @@@.

DOCTOR X159
Oh I forgot about that.  Good.  Your blood pressure was a little better when I checked it than when the nurse checked it.

PATIENT X159
Good for you.  I think probably @@@.

DOCTOR X159
What's that?

PATIENT X159
Next time I @@@.

DOCTOR X159
Right.  Deep breaths.  In and out.  In and out.  In and out.  Good.  Where is the pain, point to me where the pain is?

PATIENT X159
It's right in here.

DOCTOR X159
If I push in does it hurt?

PATIENT X159
No.  It's more on the side, but it's above the belt line.

DOCTOR X159
Point to me where it is.

PATIENT X159
It's right in through here.

DOCTOR X159
Now does that hurt?

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
No.

PATIENT X159
No, like I said the only time it really hurts is.

DOCTOR X159
Give me your hand.

PATIENT X159
When I uh get up in the morning.

DOCTOR X159
You've never had any other signs of osteoarthritis?

PATIENT X159
Not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR X159
Okay squeeze but not too hard, good.  Lift up, lift pull, good.  When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

PATIENT X159
When I was here.

DOCTOR X159
How recently?

PATIENT X159
Uh it'd be four months ago now.

DOCTOR X159
Oh four months ago.  No ulcers on your feet?

PATIENT X159
No what?

DOCTOR X159
Ulcers on your feet?

PATIENT X159
No.

DOCTOR X159
Now did they do, they did something in 2002, but they did a colonoscopy in 2002?  Oh I see you had tubular adenoma that's why.  But did the colonoscopy in 2002 as well huh?

PATIENT X159
Yes.

DOCTOR X159
And 2010.

PATIENT X159
I had it three, this is the third time I had it done.

DOCTOR X159
Yeah did they not take any biopsies this time?

PATIENT X159
Uh evidently not.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.

PATIENT X159
If they did the, all I got is the letter stating that the colon is normal.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.

PATIENT X159
That's all I got and like you said the hemorrhoids were there.

DOCTOR X159
Yeah okay sir I'll be right back, give me a few minutes.

PATIENT X159
Can I put this back in?

DOCTOR X159
Yeah of course, yes.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:15  DOCTOR IN:  54:38)

DOCTOR X159
Alright.  Well the good news is you're doing great.

PATIENT X159
Thank you.

DOCTOR X159
Um I think really the only thing that we would need to do is obviously if you have worsening pain just let me know.  If you start having fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, worsening pain let me know.  I think this is all just degenerative changes in your spine.  You can take ibuprofen.

PATIENT X159
Any particular brand would be recommended?

DOCTOR X159
Aleve is fine.

PATIENT X159
Aleve instead of ibuprofen.

DOCTOR X159
You can take that too, that's not important.

PATIENT X159
That's better than Advil or Tylenol?

DOCTOR X159
Yeah.

PATIENT X159
Same thing?

DOCTOR X159
Well the Tylenol is not the same thing.

PATIENT X159
Oh.

DOCTOR X159
But uh ibuprofen are.

PATIENT X159
Well I, personally I don't like to take anything.

DOCTOR X159
Right, well if it doesn't bother you very much then you don't have to.

PATIENT X159
Like I say.

DOCTOR X159
But if you have problems well then take it.

PATIENT X159
Okay.

DOCTOR X159
Um obviously if you have any worsening symptoms let us know.  Uh all your labs are pretty much up-to-date.  We really don't need to do any labs until probably six, seven months from now.

PATIENT X159
Great.

DOCTOR X159
Flu shot, as soon as they come in they'll give you a mass mailing and you can come in to get it.

PATIENT X159
Okay.

DOCTOR X159
And then I don't think you need to see me for six months unless something pops up, in which case you just call up and let me know and we'll see you earlier.  How does that sound?

PATIENT X159
Thank you very much.

DOCTOR X159
You're welcome.  That was an easy, easy solution.  I hope so.

PATIENT X159
Yeah.

DOCTOR X159
Nice to see you.  

PATIENT X159
Alright.

DOCTOR X159
Have a good evening.

PATIENT X159
Doc.

DOCTOR X159
Did you bring anything?

PATIENT X159
I didn't bring anything.

DOCTOR X159
Okay.  (Doctor talking with someone else)

PATIENT X159
I should get that sent to the house correct?

DOCTOR X159
Yeah absolutely.

PATIENT X159
Thank you sir.

SECOND PERSON X454
Here I am.

PATIENT X454
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X454
He called your name and didn't see you.  How are you good.

PATIENT X454
Pardon?

SECOND PERSON X454
How are you?

DOCTOR X454
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X454
Okay.

DOCTOR X454
Been real busy today.   I'm trying to; uh give me one second okay.  Alrighty.  So, I've been looking through your chart overall to try and make sure you know take a look at things that have been happening and it sounds like you know, we're trying to figure out where we're doing with the blood pressure medications you know.

SECOND PERSON X454
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X454
You know.  Uh what they did in Neurology, when they did the Dopplers they were concerned that you know there was basically a whole, occlusion of one side of the blood that goes to the brain basically.  So when we lowered your blood pressure with the medications it was causing the blood pressure to be low enough that there were parts of the brain that were not happy with it because all the blood was being supplied by this other section basically.  So obviously we're gonna hold off on the blood pressure okay.  How have you been feeling since we've been holding up on the blood pressure medication, better, worse, same?

PATIENT X454
Some days are pretty good and then other days I don't feel too good.

DOCTOR X454
Okay.  More often good days than bad days?

PATIENT X454
Well uh, more often good days.

DOCTOR X454
Has it improved at all since changing the way you were taking your medications?  I know you were dizzy all the time and.

PATIENT X454
Yeah I was dizzy @@@ but it wasn't bad you know.

DOCTOR X454
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X454
But some days it's much worse you know.

DOCTOR X454
Any new you known weakness, numbness, tingling anywhere?

PATIENT X454
Yeah I feel a tingling up in here.

DOCTOR X454
Okay.  Tingling and is it a strong tingling?

PATIENT X454
Yeah.

DOCTOR X454
@@@.  So the brain doctors, when you saw them, thought you know the tingling in the hand is consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.

SECOND PERSON X454
Hmm.

DOCTOR X454
On your left side.  Basically it's nothing dangerous okay.  Something just you know there's a nerve bundle that goes through the wrist here and it gets tight cord so it gets irritated and so it gets that numbness and tingling okay.  What I'm really worried about is @@@ okay.  So um, why haven't you guys gone back to follow-up with the brain doctors?

SECOND PERSON X454
No we have, so with the neurologist?

DOCTOR X454
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X454
When did they want to see @@@ I know @@@.

DOCTOR X454
Well apparently.

SECOND PERSON X454
Cause like I called when we got a reminder and the receptionist said that we had made the appointment already so we didn't have to worry about making another one, we just got the reminder, if they needed to see us they would let us know.

DOCTOR X454
So, let's get you back to Neurology and do a consult.  I think they wanted to see you after all the MRIs and stuff like that.  @@@ orders @@@ this up okay.  So @@@ I think we'll set it up.

SECOND PERSON X454
I know.

DOCTOR X454
I know you had something like this done before where they would go in and open up the artery @@@ um.  It might make a difference in how the @@@ and how you feel okay and it may or may not prevent more strokes.  I'm not sure about that to be honest um but it may be something we can work on.  Um.

SECOND PERSON X454
It depends on what they're doing too.  He just saw, was that the nurse that they were calling @@@?  What was his findings on this, you said something about his pressure was high?

DOCTOR X454
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X454
Something else that the blood flow was low?

DOCTOR X454
His heart rate is a little low.

SECOND PERSON X454
Okay his heart rate.  Cause you know I was thinking on my way in, @@@ as he was coming in and I looked @@@.

DOCTOR X454
Um, the last time he was here, do you know what it was last, it was on the lower side @@@ 40s, 50s.

SECOND PERSON X454
@@@.

PATIENT X454
Cause I've been there quite a few times.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X454
@@@.

DOCTOR X454
@@@ echo for you right?

PATIENT X454
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X454
And I don't know.  You did that @@@ right?  Or @@@ everything else.

PATIENT X454

SECOND PERSON X454

PATIENT X454
Yeah.

DOCTOR X454

PATIENT X454

DOCTOR X454
Do you need help lifting up your legs or?  Excellent.  Probably get a little bit of hair, @@@.  I'll just put some more stickers on your leg now and everybody's smart wearing like two layers of pants.  @@@.  All my patients today have been uh I'm like wow you guys are really smart cause I'm freezing when I'm walking on the outside.  And they just laugh.  

PATIENT X454
Sure.

DOCTOR X454
All hook these stickers to these wires and let's just put the camera here okay.

PATIENT X454

PATIENT X454
Well usually @@@.

DOCTOR X454
Let me ask you a question um, what type of work do you do?  @@@.

PATIENT X454
@@@.

DOCTOR X454
I'd like to see you a little better in terms of your dizziness at first before you get back @@@.  I don't want you exerting yourself too much @@@.  

PATIENT X454
Cause I don't know how long they're holding my job for me.

DOCTOR X454
Oh I see.

PATIENT X454
The pressure is on here.

DOCTOR X454
@@@.

PATIENT X454
@@@.

DOCTOR X454
@@@.  When are you gonna be able to take a break?  You know you're getting on in your years you know.

PATIENT X454
It's where I'm at.  The day I was going to retire, he says when you coming in, they just try to @@@.

DOCTOR X454
@@@.

PATIENT X454
No @@@.

DOCTOR X454
Think of what I'm saying.

PATIENT X454
@@@.

DOCTOR X454
What kind of pills are we talking about?

PATIENT X454
@@@ pills, @@@.

DOCTOR X454
We'll about that.

PATIENT X454
No and taxes, heart attacks, you know all that stuff.

DOCTOR X454
How much longer do you think you can take off before @@@ medicine.

PATIENT X454
@@@ got, @@@.  But that's why they moved in @@@.

DOCTOR X454
@@@.  I don't want to drive if you're dizzy so that part of your job I don't think you should do.

SECOND PERSON X454
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X454
Even if you go back now I would not recommend, you can put on your clothing, but I would not, when it comes down to you not @@@.  Um if you had to go back to work, about @@@ dizziness.

PATIENT X454
Yeah.

DOCTOR X454
But if you have to go back to work I'd recommend that you @@@ not going to be chasing down anybody, you're not doing any type of heavy activity.  But still you could monitor and watch the screen and I think that'd be okay but any type of long patrolling where you're gonna be walking or hiking or things like that I don't really recommend that okay.  

PATIENT X454
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X454
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X454
@@@ maybe one time you know.  So my only shelter is in the car @@@.  So I'm gonna have to hole up I guess.

SECOND PERSON X454
Yes.

PATIENT X454
@@@.

DOCTOR X454
I want to bring you back to see the brain doctors and you can see what they recommend in terms of if this needs to be fixed or um and I want you to see @@@ in terms of your dizziness but I have to be honest uh you're getting on in the age where I'm concerned that you might need to take things a little more easier.

SECOND PERSON X454
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X454
Alright.

SECOND PERSON X454
@@@.

DOCTOR X454
I know you've got bills to pay um but your, is there anything else you can cut back on so that you don't have to work?  Are you getting Social Security benefits and things like that already?

PATIENT X454
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X454
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X454
And that's not.

PATIENT X454
Won't cover it.  That's about a thousand a month.

SECOND PERSON X454
Then we didn't have nothing in savings for a little while.

DOCTOR X454
@@@ you find you're in a position where you get to watch monitors @@@ rather than just walking around or driving?  Cause that's reasonable for me here, not.

PATIENT X454
I don't know.

DOCTOR X454
You don't, they don't require you to drive where you can just @@@ for a while, not worry about slipping on ice and falling in the daytime then.

PATIENT X454
Uh.

SECOND PERSON X454
See the other thing is @@@.

DOCTOR X454
That's true.

SECOND PERSON X454
Is just, is just @@@ around the block.

DOCTOR X454
Okay.

PATIENT X454
@@@ about a block, a block and a half long where I travel around.

SECOND PERSON X454
Do you get out at all?

PATIENT X454
You have to get out and uh @@@ and go on to the next station.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON X454
Then get in the car and ride on to the next one.

PATIENT X454
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X454
Okay you know after they announced the @@@ get back around @@@.

PATIENT X454
Right.

SECOND PERSON X454
All day.

PATIENT X454
@@@.  That's what I say.

SECOND PERSON X454
So just basically now @@@.

PATIENT X454
Ohio and @@@.

DOCTOR X454
I can say, I can't tell you not to @@@ uh but let's say let's put it off as long as possible, talk to your employer and maybe see if they can work something out where there's less you know, being able to @@@ a little better or less @@@.

PATIENT X454
I'll walk.  

DOCTOR X454
You'll walk.

PATIENT X454
About a block a day.

DOCTOR X454
Are you, @@@ are you driving on the street or is it all over in the parking lot?

PATIENT X454
No in the gate, in a big lot.

SECOND PERSON X454
In the @@@ houses.

PATIENT X454
It's just.

SECOND PERSON X454
@@@.

PATIENT X454
One big lot that's what it is.

DOCTOR X454
Okay.  So you're not in any danger of having to worry about other cars?

PATIENT X454
No, no.

SECOND PERSON X454
No.  Not until it's time to go home.  Then he drive on the street to come back home.

PATIENT X454
That doesn't bother anybody but me.

SECOND PERSON X454
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X454
You know as your doctor I can't say that it's okay for you to drive.

PATIENT X454
I understand.

DOCTOR X454
Uh but you know driving around @@@ is better than driving @@@ somebody.

PATIENT X454
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X454
True.

DOCTOR X454
Um we're gonna leave it at that.

PATIENT X454
Alright @@@ and everything.

DOCTOR X454
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X454
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X454
Well I advise you to put it off as long as possible, talk to your employer, see how long they can hold your job for and how your problems are going okay.  See if you can do that.  But while we're @@@ off I want to make sure you go back to see the brain the neurologist okay and let them take it from there okay.  I'm certainly sensitive to what you're saying.  You need to take care of yourself.  You can't, if you don't have housing, if you don't have food, it's hard to take care of other things and @@@ okay.  Give me one second; I want to chat with DOCTOR okay.

PATIENT X454
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  53:47  DOCTOR IN:  61:50)

DOCTOR X454
Sorry, two seconds.  I'm not gonna do that much for you today but I'm gonna take you back to the brain neurologist and I'm also going to set you up with the vascular doctors okay.  The vascular doctors are the ones that would look at your neck to see if uh you would benefit opening whether we should open @@@ okay.  I think those are really the people who would do you the most good in terms of hopefully getting better circulation to your brain, hopefully getting rid of the dizziness okay.  So I'm going to do everything possible.  The other thing is um @@@ it's pretty good but it's still @@@ and for people who have this type of disease, @@@ usually we want your cholesterol a little lower okay.  Are you okay with uh taking a cholesterol medication?  Do you have any problems with taking the cholesterol medications?

PATIENT X454
No I'll give it a go.

DOCTOR X454
@@@.

PATIENT X454
@@@ I think I was supposed to @@@.

DOCTOR X454
I don't see that you're on it right now.

PATIENT X454
No I'm not.  I haven't take it for @@@.

DOCTOR X454
Are you okay with you starting it again?

PATIENT X454
Yes.  That'll work.  I've taken it before, no problem.

DOCTOR X454
Okay.  It'll be a low dose.  I mean you're right on the borderline.

PATIENT X454
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X454
Okay cause we want you to be below at least 100, maybe even lower so we'll just start you on a low dose and see how you do with that.  Okay.

PATIENT X454
Yeah.

DOCTOR X454
That's the only thing I would change in terms of your medication.

PATIENT X454
Okay.

DOCTOR X454
Now your blood pressure looked okay today.  Heart looks okay today.  Um if you're consistently low like this and you're still having your dizziness I might send you back to um what we'd do, is what we call doing a Holter basically.  A Holter is, they just strap something along with these stickers, I'm not sure but it's just to monitor your heart rate over a certain time okay.  If the vascular doctors don't think this is causing the dizziness I may do that Holter okay.  To see if the low heart rate is the reason why you're uh dizzy.

PATIENT X454
Okay.

DOCTOR X454
Yeah I'm not sure that it is.  Your blood pressure is @@@, okay.

PATIENT X454
I don't have to go back to the MRI thing anymore?

DOCTOR X454
You didn't like that huh?

PATIENT X454
No, I don't want to go back and do that.

DOCTOR X454
Well I don't want to speak for the vascular doctors but my perspective is that you know we've already documented @@@, we know that there's a narrowing there, we know you've had strokes in the past um so I don't know what we'd gain from that um but I can't speak for other clinics okay.  And if they order it make sure you let them know that you're very anxious and you didn't like it and maybe they can give you some medication to relax you.

SECOND PERSON X454
That's what I told him.

DOCTOR X454
Okay.  Alright um let me order the medication that I want you to use.  It's called simvastatin okay.

SECOND PERSON X454
I take that.

DOCTOR X454
Uh and so you need to look out for you know some muscle aches um sometimes it can cause that but very rarely okay.  Um let's see when was the last time we checked your liver functions, usually we like to have a baseline @@@.  Okay.  Okay checked in November @@@.  So um I can go ahead and start the medication but after a month and after you've been taking we usually check your liver again to see if you're doing okay.

PATIENT X454
Okay.

DOCTOR X454
Cause sometimes this can interact with the liver a little bit.

PATIENT X454
Oh.

DOCTOR X454
Give me one second; I want to put in the referral to the vascular doctor okay.  I @@@ give me one second.  @@@ are the doctors.  Alright, so do me a favor, when you go back outside you're going to need two appointments made okay.  Neurology next available and I want you to see Peripheral Vascular Surgery also next available.  I want you to see them as soon as possible okay.  And then for me would two months sound reasonable for you guys or is that too soon?  Cause I want to make sure that nothing gets dropped and we'll just talk with you and you get the appropriate tests.  @@@.  Or you can see me you know.  I just want to make sure it's okay with you because you know if I bring you back too much and you don't like me anymore then I don't want that to happen.

PATIENT X454
No that's fine.

DOCTOR X454
Of course you have a choice, that's why I asked.  You know I want to make sure it's okay with you that I bring you back so often cause you know.  Normally I wouldn't see somebody as often as I would see you because I'm seeing so often cause I want to get as much stuff done as possible so you can go back to work when you need to and also I want to make sure that your dizziness gets better okay.  But I mean, but if it becomes a hardship for you to continue to be off, then of course we want to work together and make sure it doesn't become worse okay.  Before you come to see me next time, do me a favor, don't eat breakfast and we'll get some blood tests on you so um the next time you come see me in about two months, come a little earlier.  Whenever your appointment is come earlier so you can get the blood tests done at the Lab and then come see me afterwards.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON X454
So don't eat.

DOCTOR X454
Yeah, don't eat that morning.  Okay, but for today please make these two appointments up front okay.  

SECOND PERSON X454
Any more questions?  And you got @@@.

PATIENT X454
Hmm.

DOCTOR X454
It takes to @@@ if you have questions, just stop in for a little bit.  

SECOND PERSON X454
@@@.

PATIENT X454
Oh yeah.  Maybe they cut that out, I don't know.

SECOND PERSON X454
Maybe @@@.

DOCTOR X454
@@@.

PATIENT X454
Now at one time uh @@@.

DOCTOR X454
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X454
Momentarily.

DOCTOR X454
Momentarily.  Uh I think that's reasonable um.

PATIENT X454
I don't know if they @@@ for it now.

DOCTOR X454
Well @@@ cut it in half.  @@@ work to try that.  When you @@@ figure that out okay.  @@@.  So when you go back up front there's a number, @@@ number.

SECOND PERSON X454
What is it?

DOCTOR X454
Okay that may be the people you would talk to to see if you quality for any @@@ or things like that okay.

SECOND PERSON X454
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR X454
They will be the most up-to-date people who would know what you'd be qualified for okay.  But yeah, don't @@@ okay.  Whatever we can do to help, definitely @@@ do it okay.

SECOND PERSON X454
That's it?

DOCTOR X454
That is it.

PATIENT X454
Okay good enough.

SECOND PERSON X454
Thank you sir.  You have a good day now.

DOCTOR X454
You two take care, uh-huh.

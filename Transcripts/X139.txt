PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Let me look, it looks like you went to the ER in June and March and in June they did prednisone.  They gave you antibiotics @@@.  How do you think that went, did that help?

PATIENT X139
It did.

DOCTOR X139
Okay and how do you feel right now?

PATIENT X139
Uh, @@@ outside, I'm in air conditioning now so.  It's like 95 degrees @@@.

DOCTOR X139
The albuterol inhalers?

PATIENT X139

DOCTOR X139
Any coughs?

PATIENT X139
Yeah I cough.

DOCTOR X139
How bad?

PATIENT X139
Ah sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night coughing and I take the inhaler.

DOCTOR X139
Is it improved with the inhaler?

PATIENT X139
Yes.

DOCTOR X139
And in general how's your exercise tolerance, can you walk without getting short of breath?

PATIENT X139
Well yeah.

DOCTOR X139
So how far can you walk?

PATIENT X139
I don't know, I'm used to walking at least a mile.  I need to walk @@@ and back again @@@.

DOCTOR X139
So you can walk?

PATIENT X139
Yes.

DOCTOR X139
@@@.

PATIENT X139
Yes.

DOCTOR X139
You don't feel winded in your breathing?

PATIENT X139
No.  It depends on what I'm doing.  Like if I'm moving something heavy then, yeah moving something heavy.

DOCTOR X139
Okay and you're taking the Combivent?

PATIENT X139
Yeah.

DOCTOR X139
The albuterol and the formoterol.

PATIENT X139
@@@ one, I discontinued one @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Oh.  @@@.

PATIENT X139
Um.  @@@.

DOCTOR X139
I want to make sure you have enough so that you don't have to keep calling, you now to get hold of me.

PATIENT X139
I have to come @@@.

DOCTOR X139

PATIENT X139
Oh.

DOCTOR X139
You already had the formoterol so continue to use it @@@.  Refill for @@@.

PATIENT X139
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X139

PATIENT X139
No you know just @@@.  Break out in a cold sweat you now and hopefully by the time I get to work @@@.

DOCTOR X139
I hear you, it's hot out.  It's a hot day.

PATIENT X139
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X139
@@@.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
@@@ this morning.

PATIENT X139
My @@@ was 95.  @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Any trouble with weight loss or weight gain?

PATIENT X139
Uh you know @@@.

DOCTOR X139
So how's your appetite?

PATIENT X139
Uh you know the other day @@@.

DOCTOR X139
But at night you eat a real meal?

PATIENT X139
Yeah late night @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Let's see here, did you quit smoking?

PATIENT X139
Yeah still working on it.

DOCTOR X139
Um.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
What do you want to do to quit?  How else can I help you?

PATIENT X139
Well I had the patches, but I still got some of those.  I use @@@.  I put one on @@@ I change it and tried it when I go to work @@@.  Mooching off me and @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Would you want to see the Smoking Cessation Clinic here?  Maybe they have.  I mean I can offer you patches and @@@ drugs but they may have some different method of um smoking cessation like using behavioral modification or.

PATIENT X139
Well, I'd much rather try it on my own.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.

PATIENT X139
I'm not sure @@@.

DOCTOR X139
How much are you smoking?

PATIENT X139
Uh about maybe a half a pack a day now.  I've cut down.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.

PATIENT X139
@@@ like three cigarettes @@@.

DOCTOR X139
It's hard, I mean I've never smoked so I don't really know a lot about it but, from what I hear it's hard to @@@.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Yeah but it would improve your lung function.

PATIENT X139
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X139
You know your lung function will continue to deteriorate at a rapid rate if you keep smoking.  If you stop smoking it kind of goes back to the normal deteriorating rate, you know if you hadn't smoked so.

PATIENT X139
Now did you get my medical forms?  I brought in my uh medical stuff from my other doctors and she said she was going to give it to you.

DOCTOR X139
Let me look.  It might be in my mailbox right now, when did you bring it in?

PATIENT X139
Well last.

DOCTOR X139
Long time ago?

PATIENT X139
Yes.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.

PATIENT X139
The first time I went to the Emergency Room @@@ follow-up.

DOCTOR X139
And then you saw me.

PATIENT X139
No I saw somebody else, DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X139
Oh, between me and the.

PATIENT X139
Yeah.

DOCTOR X139
Oh you saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT X139
No I didn't see a doctor, another girl but.

DOCTOR X139
Yeah the resident.

PATIENT X139
Then I came back one day I had an appointment with you but then it was cancelled so then I got in to see the nurse and I gave the nurse the forms @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Let me look for that.

PATIENT X139
Yeah if you could.  My doctor @@@ 50% @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Well we were going to repeat the PFT but I don't think that's been done yet.  The order is in.  Oh definitely.  Let me see if I can find it.  Oh you didn't show up, maybe you didn't know.  When they set you up for an appointment on 03/11 at 2 o'clock but it says you didn't show up.

PATIENT X139
I didn't get anything.

DOCTOR X139
Here why @@@.  We need to check your lung function.

PATIENT X139
This time I got one, I was going to be on vacation then and now I have to take off and I'm losing money @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Well, it doesn't take very long.  @@@ 15 minutes.  

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Yeah.  Want to hold off for now?

PATIENT X139
Let's hold off for now and uh.

DOCTOR X139
If your symptoms start to change then we'll make more of an effort to.

PATIENT X139
Yeah, @@@.  I'd like to hang on to @@@ until I get my medication.

DOCTOR X139
Let me check your vitals.  Blood pressure is a little high; I just want to recheck it.  Looks like we checked some labs back in February.

PATIENT X139
Blood work.

DOCTOR X139
It looks like your blood counts look good.  Your kidney function is good.  Your cholesterol looks good.  We want this number under 200 and @@@ under 150 and its 100 and this is your good cholesterol the HDL and yours is great.  That's like the best good cholesterol I've ever seen.  Well that's another thing we probably need to talk about um.  How much are you drinking?

PATIENT X139
Uh maybe four drinks a week.

DOCTOR X139
So last time you told me eight so that must be getting better.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.  Well maybe @@@.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
@@@.  Why did we do the @@@ again?

PATIENT X139
Uh.

DOCTOR X139
Oh the weight loss.

PATIENT X139
Yeah.

DOCTOR X139
Huh, right.  But they didn't see anything.  

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Well they saw like some degenerative joint disease in the spine which happens when people get older.  You get a little bit of arthritis, just like you would get in you know your knees and spine.  So if that becomes a problem you have to let me know.

PATIENT X139
I get it once in a while, right in my lower back.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.  I think it was about here where they saw it.

PATIENT X139
I just get it once in a while.

DOCTOR X139
@@@ and the treatment for that would be taking something like Tylenol or ibuprofen.

PATIENT X139
Oh.

DOCTOR X139
Or Naproxen or something like that.  Uh, okay.  I'd forgotten about that.  So it looked okay.  Good.  The PFTs we'll need to do it later okay.  Okay, what else were we going to do?  Oh did you see Mental Health?

PATIENT X139
No I didn't.

DOCTOR X139
Do you feel depressed at all?

PATIENT X139
Just @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Okay so normal.

PATIENT X139
Yeah, just the normal feelings.

DOCTOR X139
No feelings of hurting yourself.

PATIENT X139
No.

DOCTOR X139
@@@.  

PATIENT X139
@@@.  

DOCTOR X139
I'm going to check a couple other things here while you're here.  They checked your prostate gland it looks fine.  They checked your thyroid and it looks good.  The cholesterol we talked about.  They checked your vitamin levels, sometimes when you drink beer you don't get the right vitamins.

PATIENT X139
Yeah.

DOCTOR X139
That all looks good.  So far so good.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Yeah, you just quit smoking though really, we talked about that so.

PATIENT X139
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X139
Uh now a colonoscopy, what do you think about that?

PATIENT X139
No.

DOCTOR X139
So you're still thinking about it.

PATIENT X139
I'm still thinking about it.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.  Um everything else looks good.  Well, let me take a look at you.  You don't drive after you drink or anything like that?

PATIENT X139
No I don't believe in that.  @@@.

DOCTOR X139
No.  You don't need it and neither does anyone else on the street.

PATIENT X139
Yeah I know, my twin brother got a warrant out for his arrest so he used my name and put @@@ under that and now, @@@ died here and he got the warrant out it's on me now too.

DOCTOR X139
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT X139
So whenever they look for my license plate, his name comes up and my name comes up and I get pulled over and I end up going back to the station and everything so.

DOCTOR X139
Oh my God.  Is this recent?

PATIENT X139
Uh nine years ago is when he died up here.

DOCTOR X139
Oh man.

PATIENT X139
And uh, he was a bad boy.

DOCTOR X139
Well he's your brother.

PATIENT X139
Yeah, messing around.  Ever since he @@@ when he was 15.

DOCTOR X139
He was trouble.

PATIENT X139
@@@.  But every time he got, every time he got arrested.

DOCTOR X139
@@@.

PATIENT X139
Yeah.

DOCTOR X139
@@@.

PATIENT X139
No.  I think he had a @@@.  

DOCTOR X139
When people @@@.  

PATIENT X139
Yeah I can see something bright, like on a bright day, I @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
That's really weird, I didn't notice that last time.  We always worry about people @@@.

PATIENT X139
Right.

DOCTOR X139
It's a big problem, but you've had it for a long time so.  You know.  Not to scare you, I am sure it is fine.

PATIENT X139
No it never bothered me.

DOCTOR X139
Take a deep breath, again.  Breathe normally.  Let's repeat your blood pressure.  All my patients in the hospital right have to have blood pressures.  I've been repeating them all day.

PATIENT X139
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X139
Getting really good at it.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Huh?

PATIENT X139
Wife's was 247/197.

DOCTOR X139
Oh my God at home?

PATIENT X139
No she's in the hospital.  She had an infection on her leg @@@.

DOCTOR X139
I had someone come into the clinic with a blood pressure like that.  @@@.  It's 170/90.

PATIENT X139
@@@.

DOCTOR X139
Yeah it could be the stress of parking and getting in here.  Okay.  I got to make sure we're going to treat you.  Otherwise you feel pretty good?  Your lungs sound good.

PATIENT X139
Yeah.  Doing good.

DOCTOR X139
Okay and no blood in the stool or anything?

PATIENT X139
No.

DOCTOR X139
So think about the colonoscopy.  I mean I can't force you but it's always a good idea to look.

PATIENT X139
Yeah I know, my boss was telling me that.

DOCTOR X139
Yeah, well early detection is nice because they pull the polyp out and it's gone so.

PATIENT X139
Yeah.

DOCTOR X139
So yeah.

PATIENT X139
But um.  I was going to ask you, how bad, I mean the lowest blood pressure how low can it go?

DOCTOR X139
Well.

PATIENT X139
To where it's bad.

DOCTOR X139
For you you mean?

PATIENT X139
No my wife, she's been on medication.

DOCTOR X139
It's kind of dependent on symptoms uh for her, once you hit below like 90, the top number 90.

PATIENT X139
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X139
Then you kind of have to start to worry that maybe the blood pressure medicine is too much and especially if she feels lightheaded when she stands up.

PATIENT X139
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X139
Or feels like she's going to pass out, you know that kind of feeling then you have to worry if the blood pressure medicine is too much.

PATIENT X139
Okay.

DOCTOR X139
So.

PATIENT X139
I wish I could get her here @@@.

DOCTOR X139
And sometimes too if you, if you want, just kind of like that's what we do here in the hospital but if you take her blood pressure lying down.

PATIENT X139
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X139
And then have her stand up and stand for like two minutes and then take her blood pressure standing up, those numbers should be almost the same.  If the blood pressure standing up is a lot lower like 20 points lower then she's probably on too much medicine okay.

PATIENT X139
Okay.  Thanks.

DOCTOR X139
So you could try that and if it's real low.  So I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X139
Alright.

DOCTOR X139
Five minutes.

PATIENT X139
Okay.

DOCTOR X139
I'm the only one here so.  Real quick.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:36  DOCTOR IN:  44:08)

DOCTOR X139
Okay, you're good, nothing new.

PATIENT X139
Alright.

DOCTOR X139
When do you think you should come back.  Do you want to try and do six months?

PATIENT X139
Yeah.

DOCTOR X139
Okay if something happens obviously.

PATIENT X139
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X139
Come back sooner.

PATIENT X139
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Or I mean, do you think you can handle waiting to see me or something just try and make an appointment sooner.  If you need to come to the ER, come to the ER.

PATIENT X139
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR X139
Okay.

PATIENT X139

DOCTOR X139
Yeah well if you run out call and I'll refill them.

PATIENT X139

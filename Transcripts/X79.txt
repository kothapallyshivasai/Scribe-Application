DOCTOR X79
Okay.  Is that normal for you?

PATIENT X79
No usually um I mean I noticed it was usually running like 165.  I had two days where it went kind of high and I remember taking uh, I was taking some cough medicine before I went to bed.

DOCTOR X79
Yeah.

PATIENT X79
So I knew what one was and then the second one I had, I tried to back track and figure out what I had that day, it might have boosted it up why I might have eaten, ate late.

DOCTOR X79
What do you take for your diabetes?

PATIENT X79
I don't know.

DOCTOR X79

DOCTOR X79
@@@ they must have thought that you had something wrong with your heart, if I can find it.

PATIENT X79
Yeah, yeah @@@ at xxx xxx @@@.

DOCTOR X79
Yeah.

PATIENT X79
And um I changed to uh xxx cause I had a primary physician over there.

DOCTOR X79
Okay.

And they ran me do the chest because uh.

DOCTOR X79
When is the last time you had an EKG done?

PATIENT X79
Before I was at 138 and @@@.

DOCTOR X79
Okay so you were downtown.

PATIENT X79
So I was closer to xxx.

DOCTOR X79
So you did have one in 2007.

PATIENT X79
@@@ the reason I stopped going over there and the reason I had my surgery, my prostate surgery was done at xxx, is because I did the, they did the biopsy and they never called me up to let me know what was going on.

DOCTOR X79
So you @@@.

PATIENT X79
So all of a sudden, yeah they left me hanging and suddenly you know, I got a note that I have an appointment.  I come in and uh @@@ surgeon comes up to me and says when do you want your surgery.

DOCTOR X79
And you're like what?

PATIENT X79
I'm like you sure you have the right person?  I looked at him like he was oh like he was from Mars or something.  It took a whole month.  @@@.  So uh I went in and talked to a nurse, uh the head nurse at the time and they took me to discuss the stuff @@@ and all of a sudden they wanted me through a whole battery of tests and then uh, I @@@.

DOCTOR X79

PATIENT X79
Okay.

DOCTOR X79
And then I want to look at your.  And I don't see where it.  So what are they telling you about your diabetes?

PATIENT X79
They told me it wasn't under control and I'm like, every time I came in here you're telling me @@@.  I've already had been a full day.

DOCTOR X79
Yeah.

PATIENT X79
And I says you now I, sure I've eaten since then I said but uh I always.  When I was told that I had diabetes and I was told by the nurse to take uh, to check.  All I needed to do was check it once a day.

DOCTOR X79
Yeah.

PATIENT X79
It's all this flip flopping all around and making, @@@. 

DOCTOR X79
Yeah.

PATIENT X79
So the readings were uh flip flopping so they was like well you know you're not really keeping it under control but since um they got on my case about it and my mother got on my case about it I've been doing, I do it every day.

DOCTOR X79
That's what you need to do good.  Alright do you mind if I take a quick look at you?  I think you're gonna be fine if you get the surgery.

PATIENT X79
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X79
I want to, I'm gonna make sure that you get this medication back before you start so that you can take that before the surgery but otherwise I think you're gonna be just fine.

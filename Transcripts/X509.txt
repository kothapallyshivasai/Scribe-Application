DOCTOR X509
Okay.  Have you taken anything for it?

PATIENT X509
Uh I washed my hair with NIX.

PATIENT X509
Well I think like they just both.  They kind of white.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.

PATIENT X509

DOCTOR X509
Okay.

PATIENT X509
With your fingernail.

DOCTOR X509
And you used the NIX shampoo before?

PATIENT X509

DOCTOR X509

DOCTOR X509

DOCTOR X509
Okay um.

PATIENT X509
And here on my back here, my low back are painful uh my about right here but it's by the @@@ of the back it's uh.

DOCTOR X509
It's painful as well.

PATIENT X509
Yes sir um sometimes it radiates also to my neck.  Thank God it's not every day but sometimes I'm afraid to move.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.  Uh are you still using the drugs?

PATIENT X509
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.  So you know obviously it's gonna be very difficult to get like a surgeon or someone to do something about that if you're still doing that um.  I know we've discussed it in the past.  You maybe doing the Outpatient Treatment Program and then doing the Inpatient Treatment Program.  Do you feel like that's something you want to do right now or no?

PATIENT X509
I'd like to stop.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.

PATIENT X509
I'm tired you know, every day @@@.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.  Do you know how to get in touch with them?

PATIENT X509
No sir.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.  Uh I believe the way it works here is you go to the Outpatient Treatment Program and you kind of have to show up every day, show them you know that you can be reliable to come here every day and then after a while you transition to the Inpatient Treatment Program.

PATIENT X509
I'd like to.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.

PATIENT X509
I'd like to yes.

DOCTOR X509
Alright.  I can get you some information on somewhere you can go for that uh and you know that's kind of the road you need to start going down and then we can talk about maybe doing something for the back pain okay.

PATIENT X509

DOCTOR X509
Okay.  How do you use your drugs?  You use heroin correct?

PATIENT X509

DOCTOR X509

Before I used this one.

DOCTOR X509
You know how to look to see if it's infected right?

PATIENT X509
Hmm.

DOCTOR X509
If it gets like really red and swollen and hot and painful, then you need to come to the ER okay.

PATIENT X509

DOCTOR X509
I hope you never do as well.  Alright.  What medications are you taking right now?

PATIENT X509
Uh I was taking ibuprofen 600.

DOCTOR X509
They're gone.

PATIENT X509
Yes.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.

PATIENT X509
And.

DOCTOR X509
You just ran out or what?

PATIENT X509
Well uh before run out I was starting stored in my car; I have too many thieves here in xxx.  When I came back they were already stolen and uh I'm taking uh for the prostate too, they have @@@ I think @@@ mg and multivitamins.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.  Just were you, are you having indigestion?  Like acid reflux?

PATIENT X509
Not all the time uh when I go to shit then it's very hard, I push pretty hard.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.  Uh you may be dehydrated, especially now in the summer.  You're probably outside a lot and you sweat.  You get dehydrated and that's gonna cause that so, plenty of water okay.

PATIENT X509
Oh, yes sir.

DOCTOR X509
Um what do you eat?

PATIENT X509
Oh sometimes I eat lunch and sometimes I have a sister who is in Washington, they make very good soup and fruit salads and lettuce salad.

DOCTOR X509
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X509
@@@.

DOCTOR X509
The more fruits and vegetables you eat yet, that's more fiber and that'll make it easier for you to go to the bathroom too.

PATIENT X509
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X509
Okay so a lot of that stuff.

PATIENT X509
Alright sir.

DOCTOR X509
Alright.  Do you need that prostate pill?

PATIENT X509
Oh no I, I lost it the other day, I just got it last week.

DOCTOR X509
Okay so you have some of it still?

PATIENT X509
Yes sir, I still have some.

DOCTOR X509
Good, good.  Um so do you want to keep taking the ibuprofen, was it helping you?

PATIENT X509
Well it helps a little, better than nothing.

DOCTOR X509
Right so I could get you some more of the ibuprofen.

PATIENT X509
Alright.

DOCTOR X509
Uh and then has anyone ever checked your cholesterol?

PATIENT X509
Well a long time ago.

DOCTOR X509
Alright so they just checked it last year.  Your cholesterol looks really good.

PATIENT X509
Thank you.

DOCTOR X509
You're doing something right.  You probably walk a lot every day don't you?

PATIENT X509
Well I paint houses.

DOCTOR X509
You do what?

PATIENT X509
Paint houses.  You know with a @@@.

DOCTOR X509
Oh you paint, but you're moving a lot right?

PATIENT X509
Right.

DOCTOR X509
So you walk around the city quite a bit.

PATIENT X509
Well yes I @@@.

DOCTOR X509
That's good for your heart.  That's why your cholesterol looks so good.  Okay.

PATIENT X509
How, you have the numbers there?

DOCTOR X509
Yep.  So the most important numbers are the bad cholesterol um.  Did anyone in your family ever die of a heart attack?

PATIENT X509
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X509
Who?

PATIENT X509
My father.

DOCTOR X509
Your father.  Uh and did anyone, do you uh smoke?

PATIENT X509
Yes.

DOCTOR X509
You do, how much?

PATIENT X509
Um about 8 or 10.

DOCTOR X509
Okay.

PATIENT X509
I'm trying to do less sometimes though.

DOCTOR X509
Um and you don't have diabetes right?

PATIENT X509
My two, my father and my two grandmothers.

DOCTOR X509
But you don't have it?

PATIENT X509
Uh I hope I don't.  I have it in the family.

DOCTOR X509
I don't think you do.  So yours should be less than 130 and its 111 so you're doing great.

PATIENT X509
Oh.

DOCTOR X509
And then your good cholesterol should be greater than 45 and it's 52.

PATIENT X509
Oh.

DOCTOR X509
That's also good.  Alright.

PATIENT X509
And one thing that I always forget and now it's on my mind now about the prostate uh how uh, how do I say this in English uh, what the prognosis uh in the future of if I.

DOCTOR X509
Right.

PATIENT X509
That might get cancer?

DOCTOR X509
So um has anyone in your family ever had prostate cancer?

PATIENT X509
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR X509
No.  And you were, so the high risk rate for having prostate cancer is African-American and you're not African-American.   You have no family history of prostate cancer um so even if we, there's two steps you can do.  There's a blood test and then you can do an exam where you have to stick a finger in your butt to feel your prostate and based on what we find on those sometimes they recommend biopsies but there's a lot of evidence that shows that we end up biopsying too many people and causing more problems than we're actually helping people.

PATIENT X509
Hmm.

DOCTOR X509
So I would not recommend we even do that.  I think your prostate problem is very normal for someone your age and you don't have any family history of problems so I wouldn't want to go any further down that road okay.

PATIENT X509
Okay.  Um @@@ population.

DOCTOR X509
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X509
How, like a percent that you know.

DOCTOR X509
Right, right.

PATIENT X509
Give me a statistic.

DOCTOR X509
So if you um, if everyone so let's do like 90, if you cut them open when they die and looked at their prostate, almost all of them would have prostate cancer.  But in most people it's a very slow growing non-dangerous tumor.

PATIENT X509
Hmm.

DOCTOR X509
So if you, if you start drawing the blood tests on people and if you see it looks a little elevated, maybe we should do a biopsy or maybe we should take the prostate out.  You're probably gonna cause more problems with those surgical procedures than you're gonna fix because most of those people would have lived their regular, normal, completely healthy life and never had any problems with that prostate cancer okay.

PATIENT X509
Oh okay, thank you so much.

DOCTOR X509
So I think in you I would recommend not even testing it okay.  How many times do you have to get up at night to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT X509
Before @@@ a bunch of times time but.

DOCTOR X509
But now that you're on the terazosin you don't?

PATIENT X509
Mainly about two, three times.  Sometimes I sleep straight.

DOCTOR X509
So it's been better.

PATIENT X509
And no going to the room.

DOCTOR X509
Alright.  Let me go talk to my boss and we'll get you moving okay.

PATIENT X509
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X509
Alright I'll see you in a little bit.

PATIENT X509
Alright sir.  I wait outside?

DOCTOR X509
You what?  You can wait right here, you're fine.

PATIENT X509
Oh okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  56:19  DOCTOR IN:  61:55)

DOCTOR X509
Alright so here's what we're gonna do today.  When you leave you can schedule your follow-up appointment here um, just go out front and tell them you need to come back in six months right and then whenever you're ready to try the Outpatient Rehab Program, do you know where the PACC is, right across from the ER, you can just walk in there any day.  Okay I'll put the consult in the computer and they'll be ready for you whenever um you want to show up and then you want, we'll get you the ibuprofen, the NIX hair wash and then you need some of the omeprazole for your stomach, for your reflux okay, we'll get that as well.  Alright.

PATIENT X509
Thank you.

DOCTOR X509
Anything else?

PATIENT X509
Not right now, I don't think so.

DOCTOR X509
Alright.  I'll see you back in six months okay.

PATIENT X509
Alright sir.

DOCTOR X509
Alright.  It was good to see you, take care of yourself okay.

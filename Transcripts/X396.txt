DOCTOR X396
PATIENT.  Hi.

PATIENT X396
@@@.  How you doing?

DOCTOR X396
I heard you were in the hospital.

PATIENT X396
Yeah.

DOCTOR X396
How you doing?

PATIENT X396
Well the first thing I need to do is @@@ last time.

DOCTOR X396
Is that when you went to the hospital?

PATIENT X396
No I was in the hospital because I had chronic hepatitis and my @@@ was up.

DOCTOR X396
How you doing now?

PATIENT X396
Well I feel I'm just doing a little better.  Every now and then I have feels like I got to throw up but it @@@.

DOCTOR X396
I'm trying to find the Urology Notes.  How long were in the hospital for this time?

PATIENT X396
About a week.
  
DOCTOR X396
Okay.  

PATIENT X396
I'm almost sure it was a week.

DOCTOR X396
So you haven't been hospitalized in a while before this time.

PATIENT X396
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X396
@@@ put you on @@@.

PATIENT X396
@@@ monitor @@@.  When they took out @@@ it's kind of like @@@ and I had a lot of pain.  They tried to do that blockage for the nerves for it but it, it helped a little bit.  @@@ but it still hurts.
  
DOCTOR X396
Have you been to the Pain Clinic yet?

PATIENT X396
Yesterday.

DOCTOR X396
Did it help out a little bit?

PATIENT X396
Yeah a little bit but you know now when I go, you know when I be going down steps or you sometimes when I lay down and try to get up I'd be in pain or sometimes when I sit down.  But if I'm moving around for a while you know it stops and you know it's kind of like whenever I'm up but whenever I lay down or sit down and have to get up then it gives me all kind of problems.  At nighttime I'll have to you know and when I get up and use the bathroom I have to constant deal with my pain.  I have to stand up before I bend down.  

DOCTOR X396
So just remind me, so they just took out the hardware right?

PATIENT X396
Yeah.
  
DOCTOR X396
So they took out some of the hardware.

PATIENT X396
Yeah.

DOCTOR X396
And they took out the hardware, when was it?

PATIENT X396
In February.

DOCTOR X396
February.  And then since February you've been having a lot of pain in your ankle?
  
PATIENT X396
Yeah.  Cause they said there's a separation in the bone @@@.  It didn't heal properly because they took the nerve out and they don't want to do another surgery.  So they're trying to get the pain management.  Pain Management said it might work and it might not work and you have to go through a series of close to five steps before it would really make a, you know, big difference. 

DOCTOR X396
So I think probably the best thing is to kind of let's see how it goes, @@@ time right?

PATIENT X396
Yeah.

DOCTOR X396
Has anybody @@@ ankle?

PATIENT X396
No what they gave me for my back.
  
DOCTOR X396
For your back.  Are you still taking the pain meds at home?

PATIENT X396
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X396
What are you taking right now?

PATIENT X396
Morphine which don't really work that much.  Because I been on it for so long that I've built up a tolerance for it.

DOCTOR X396
Alright.

PATIENT X396
But I still have the pain and I took @@@.  You know they tried raising it, they give prescriptions now but sometime when I take them it don't even seem like it do no good cause it still has an ache and I have a stabbing pain and sometimes it feels like it's @@@.  They gave me some @@@ but @@@.
  
DOCTOR X396
Okay.

PATIENT X396
Yeah so.

DOCTOR X396
And you've got diabetes right?

PATIENT X396
Yes.

DOCTOR X396
Have you been checking your sugars at all?

PATIENT X396
Yeah my sugars been running a bit high.
  
DOCTOR X396
Which numbers?

PATIENT X396
Uh like 275, 188, it's always over the 150.  I forgot to bring my meter cause the meter holds the readings.

DOCTOR X396
Yeah.

PATIENT X396
But I forgot to bring it with me.

DOCTOR X396
So I have you taking 100 units of Glargine @@@?

PATIENT X396
No.
  
DOCTOR X396
No 14 units.

PATIENT X396
14.

DOCTOR X396
Okay and you're also taking the regular, the Novolin? 

PATIENT X396
Regular at night, well I take regular three times a day almost you know, whenever it's over the 150 and uh I take the other one and that's what I take every nighttime.

DOCTOR X396
We're gonna have to go up because your sugars, I'm looking back, have been too high.  How's your diet been?

PATIENT X396
Well my diet's been pretty where I like, you know every now and then you know I have maybe I don't have a desire to eat but most of the time I take my medicine in the morning @@@ I try to you know eat something so you know I have something that's @@@.  Yeah.
  
DOCTOR X396
Are you taking the regular insulin three times a day?

PATIENT X396
Yeah.

DOCTOR X396
@@@.

PATIENT X396
Yes and anytime I get a little more @@@.  But you know I don't gain any weight because now I'm 218 instead of @@@ and I was down, at first I was in the 180s.

DOCTOR X396
Okay.

PATIENT X396
And now I'm in the 200s because you know what insulin do for me is I take it on a regular basis, it uh raises the appetite so at nighttime they give it at night cause I'm in a transition house.
  
DOCTOR X396
Okay.

PATIENT X396
And sometime I find myself eating cookies and candy and stuff all through the night, potato chips and stuff.

DOCTOR X396
Well that's going to definitely screw up your diabetes and you know your sugars.  This is serious, I mean now @@@ insulin forever but try to eat um, if there's candy eat half of one or eat fruit okay.

PATIENT X396
Yeah.

DOCTOR X396
@@@ go for fruit over the candy.  So you're not drinking anything are you?

PATIENT X396
No.  I haven't drunk since @@@.  I had one drink during the holiday and @@@.
  
DOCTOR X396
And you're taking the gabapentin?

PATIENT X396
Yeah I be taking that every day three times a day but sometimes uh when I take all that medication you know I got a lot of things I have to do through the day and stuff so it makes me tired and sluggish but you know I go to custodian class Monday, Thursday and Friday and every day I go to ATP @@@ you know but I been having problems @@@ ATP.  I went through a lot of @@@ this week.

DOCTOR X396
@@@.

PATIENT X396
That's uh for drug and alcohol.

DOCTOR X396
Okay.

PATIENT X396
That's where they @@@.
  
DOCTOR X396
Okay.

PATIENT X396
Like recovery and.

DOCTOR X396
Okay.  Have you been having any chest pain or anything like that?

PATIENT X396
No.  But I been having a lot of frequent urination at nighttime.  Sometime I'm going to get up five, six times a night.  It's just like every time I lay down really again, you know like I say my leg, it's real bad when I have to get up and go to the bathroom cause it's real painful.

DOCTOR X396
Have you been thirsty a lot during the day?

PATIENT X396
No I cut back.  I really don't drink that much pop anymore.  I don't drink as much at dinnertime and usually for a while you know pretty much I was real bloated.  You know my stomach went out to here, it was real puffy, you know up to.
  
DOCTOR X396
Did you ever try the, I think the urinating a lot is probably from your sugars being so high okay.

PATIENT X396
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X396
So we got to try to get these under control and I think we're probably going to help you out with you peeing so much, cause that's a lot.  So @@@.

PATIENT X396
Hmm.  And it's at all times at night.  You know during the day, you see I have more urination in the nighttime than I do in the day.  You know @@@ four, five, six times a night you know.  When I'm in the xxx xxx and there's six men to the room.

DOCTOR X396
Right.

PATIENT X396
They say man, you know they whining, I say well it's probably all these medications, I know it could be my sugars too.
  
DOCTOR X396
Yeah it's probably your sugars more than anything else.

PATIENT X396
And then at night, @@@ long time that I don't have to go, you know @@@.  Last night was the first time.

DOCTOR X396
So um you just turned 50 right?

PATIENT X396
Yeah.

DOCTOR X396
So you know what happens when you turn 50?

PATIENT X396
Yeah.
  
DOCTOR X396
It's time to get a colonoscopy okay.  Do you know what that is?

PATIENT X396
That uh, through your rectum?

DOCTOR X396
Yeah.  You ever have that done before?

PATIENT X396
Yeah.

DOCTOR X396
Okay.  So when was the last time you had one?

PATIENT X396
It's been a while back.
  
DOCTOR X396
More than 10 years ago?

PATIENT X396
I don't remember, I don't think so.

DOCTOR X396
Okay.  Do you take an aspirin?

PATIENT X396
Yeah I take the one aspirin that they give me.  You know they give me uh it's a real high potency aspirin but its real tiny like baby aspirin.

DOCTOR X396
Why did they do a colonoscopy in the past?

PATIENT X396
Well I think it, I don't think I had one, I don't think I had one I'm not sure.
  
DOCTOR X396
Alright.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT X396
Yeah maybe less than, about maybe during the daytime I might smoke maybe five or six cigarettes.  So a lot of places I go, it's no smoking so you know I be going, like I say I be occupied most of the time and the places you go, like where I sleep we can't smoke, there's no smoking except during break time when you be outside and @@@ outside they got a patio and you smoke out there but you know most of the time I'm there you have groups and we always, they always put me, my time's always lots of time I don't smoke that much.

DOCTOR X396
Okay.  You're gonna have to maybe taper and get your colonoscopy okay.  That way we can check for colon cancer.  Cause I think, let's see.  Then you're gonna see the eye doctor soon right?

PATIENT X396
Yes.  Now I haven't seen, I used to go to them uh every you know every month and @@@ so um once @@@ I stopped getting my @@@ and I was telling them I had a kind of like blurry vision sometime and uh that's when they put me in for you know @@@, that was the last time I was in the hospital.

DOCTOR X700 
Hi PATIENT.

PATIENT X700
How you doing?

DOCTOR X700
Oh thank you.  Right here.  So we haven't seen you for a while.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
I'm DOCTOR and I'll be seeing you today.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
Nice to meet you.

PATIENT X700
So you're gonna be my new doctor?

DOCTOR X700
Yeah, yeah, yes.

PATIENT X700
Okay cause the last time I was here.

DOCTOR X700
It was a while ago right?

PATIENT X700
Yeah well I had come in on an emergency cause what the doc said it was a heart attack.

DOCTOR X700
You had a heart attack.

PATIENT X700
Right.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah so last time you were here you saw the cardiologist.

PATIENT X700
Right.  So before that I didn't know that my regular doctor wasn't here anymore.

DOCTOR X700
@@@.

PATIENT X700
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
So I been trying to get here but for some reason I've been missing my appointments in a while.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah @@@ come up for you?

PATIENT X700
Man I missed about three, four appointments.

DOCTOR X700
@@@.  Oh what happened with?

PATIENT X700
Well I don't know I guess with me, to see a doctor I about have to have, there better be a need you know.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
It's got to be something that, you know, first of all I have to go see someone.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
I kind of put everything else as part of me @@@ cause I'm not you know.  Like I was telling the nurse I was having problems with taking the medications I was given after my heart attack where I'd be getting headaches.

DOCTOR X700
Which one?

PATIENT X700
All of them, I quit all of them.

DOCTOR X700
All of them.

PATIENT X700
I'm just thought @@@.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.

PATIENT X700
And after I would take it you know maybe at night, maybe about an hour or so later I'd be having a headache.

DOCTOR X700
There's another one called Plavix.

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X700
That one is more important than anything else cause that, you know the stent that you have in the heart.

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X700
If you don't take that it doesn't keep your blood thin and it can clog up again which means you can have another heart attack.

PATIENT X700
Oh.

DOCTOR X700
So that one you need to take every day and I guarantee it's not the one causing headaches.  @@@.

PATIENT X700
It was kind of getting to the point where I didn't want to take any of them because I didn't know which one; you know I might take them if I could find out.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.  So how long have you not taken any of your medications?

PATIENT X700
Oh actually it's been about two, three weeks now.

DOCTOR X700
None of them, not even one of them?

PATIENT X700
No, like I said uh.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.

PATIENT X700
The headaches like migraines and especially yesterday you know when I would cough.

DOCTOR X700
Hmm.

PATIENT X700
And so I didn't know which one so I didn't take any of them.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
I kept making appointments and not getting to them you know and stuff.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.  Can you describe the headaches or was it a migraine?

PATIENT X700
It was like a migraine.

DOCTOR X700
Can you tolerate light?

PATIENT X700
Uh.

DOCTOR X700
Is it worse when you look into the light?

PATIENT X700
Yes I think it was uh.  It would be yesterday @@@.  I figured it can't be all of the medications that was doing it but I didn't know which one.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.  Well this is what we can do.

PATIENT X700
Cause I just wouldn't take it you know.

DOCTOR X700
We can restart your medications but try them like two at a time.

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X700
So the Plavix, like I said, that is definitely not one that causes headaches.

PATIENT X700
No.

DOCTOR X700
There's no way that that would be causing your headaches.  So let's restart that one because that's the most dangerous to be off of.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
Very dangerous @@@.

PATIENT X700
Well it's surprising to me that I had even had a heart attack you know and I know I had high blood pressure for a while.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.  Okay did you have chest pain and everything too right?

PATIENT X700
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
Cause it was surprising to him when I came in and the doctor said that uh.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
That's what it was you know so.

DOCTOR X700
So there's many things that could predispose you to heart attacks.  One of them is having high cholesterol, which you do have.

PATIENT X700
Yes I do right.

DOCTOR X700
And another thing high blood pressure which you do have.

PATIENT X700
Right.

DOCTOR X700
One of them is smoking, do you smoke?

PATIENT X700
Well I have started back.  I had just about stopped and I started back somewhat and I just mostly avoid it but.

DOCTOR X700
How much do you smoke now?

PATIENT X700
Now I might smoke maybe a half a pack will last me about 2-3 days.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.  Do you drink alcohol?

PATIENT X700
No only on occasions.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.

PATIENT X700
Probably celebrations, something like that but that's it.  But also um like I told my last doctor I had here's the paperwork that I need redone.

DOCTOR X700
For?

PATIENT X700
Uh for my disability.

DOCTOR X700
What are you on disability for?

PATIENT X700
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR X700
So which one needs to be filled out?

PATIENT X700
If you could fill out the renewal @@@.  It has to be renewed @@@.

DOCTOR X700
Oh, you can't walk?

PATIENT X700
Well I can only walk so far.

DOCTOR X700
Okay how far can you walk?

PATIENT X700
Then my legs kind of give out on me.  @@@ it was a blockage @@@ blockage.  See in the emergency the doctors that treated me at the time had taken out @@@ go through my new doctor you know.

DOCTOR X700
Right.

PATIENT X700
You know so if you could do it now @@@.

DOCTOR X700
This is all fine but you need to take the medications.  I don't know how much to stress to you.

PATIENT X700
Yeah, I can go.

DOCTOR X700
How important this is, you could die easily.

PATIENT X700
@@@.

DOCTOR X700
You know how important it is to take this Plavix when you have a stent in your heart.

PATIENT X700
Okay.  And I was wondering too about the aspirin that was given to me the first time when I came too.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
And when I tried to get it renewed they said I had to come back to the doctor to renew it.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah, I'll renew all your medications.

PATIENT X700
Just for the aspirin, like I say aspirin was the lowest thing on the totem pole and I got to wait and come back to the doctor for aspirin.

DOCTOR X700
Well the only reason why is because these pills that they have you on.

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X700
They wanted you to take this dose for only one month and then they wanted you to come to me here.

PATIENT X700
Right.

DOCTOR X700
And I'm supposed to put you on a lower dose cause you're only supposed to be on a high dose for one month after the heart attack.

PATIENT X700
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X700
That's why it started.

PATIENT X700
And then the nurse was telling me something about that um like on the commercial where they have, they're talking about the blood pressure and uh some kind of cough syrup that you can take.

DOCTOR X700
A what?

PATIENT X700
Some type of cough syrup that you could take.

DOCTOR X700
I'm not sure.

PATIENT X700
No to override the headaches.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.

PATIENT X700
It had something to do with uh the headaches.  I don't know.

DOCTOR X700
A cough syrup for headaches?

PATIENT X700
Yeah it was a cough syrup.  I couldn't understand it either.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
I couldn't understand it really cause before when I was taking the blood pressure pills I hadn't had headaches like that you know when I would take them you know.  

DOCTOR X700
Do you want it mailed to you or pick it up at the windows?

PATIENT X700
You know I could stop and pick it up at the window.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
Aspirin.

DOCTOR X700
Then you could probably start it today uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.  And also because you know I had surgery for my prostate you know, @@@.

DOCTOR X700
Yes.

PATIENT X700
And maybe, well I wanted to ask about uh @@@ the pump.

DOCTOR X700
To do what?

PATIENT X700
I wanted to ask about a prescription for the pump.

DOCTOR X700
The pump?

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X700
Uh we can get you referred for this um.

PATIENT X700
Because see I was taking the pills.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
But then I stopped the pills.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
And it seemed like the situation got a little worse after I had the surgery.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
So it was just a @@@ maybe I could start a pump.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
@@@.

DOCTOR X700
Well I'll have you follow up with the GU doctors so they can tell you; you know what to do to go about in getting it.  I know we don't have it here.

PATIENT X700
I thought they did cause they uh.

DOCTOR X700
Well, you can check with um.

PATIENT X700
Yeah cause the last time I was here they was talking about it at the Pharmacy.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.  Did they have the pump?

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
Hmm.

PATIENT X700
Just came out with it.

DOCTOR X700
Well I'll check for you.  Other things your blood pressure is way too high.

PATIENT X700
Maybe that's because I haven't took none of my medications @@@.

DOCTOR X700
179/98.  So why don't we do this um why don't we start you back on two of your Plavix.

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X700
And one of your blood pressure medications and see if you can tolerate that.  If you can tolerate that we'll start back your cholesterol medications too and see if you can tolerate that.

PATIENT X700
Well that's just about the only one that I was taking was for my cholesterol.  I was kind of taking that to see now I'd stopped all my blood pressure pills you know.

DOCTOR X700
So what different medications do you need for you?

PATIENT X700
Well actually uh there's @@@ something else, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR X700
The metoprolol.

PATIENT X700
It's just because the last doctor that I had.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
He had changed them to suppertime for me because it was the affects that I was getting but still I actually found out it wasn't actually the pills, it was my prostate that was uh.

DOCTOR X700
It looks like yeah you were on the metoprolol but at a low dose and Captopril.  When you were on metoprolol before did you have headaches then?

PATIENT X700
No.  All this happened just after I had had the heart attack.

DOCTOR X700
Well we can try to decrease the dose of metoprolol.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
And see if that helps.  Right now you're on 200, I'd say you can cut that in half and see if that helps.

PATIENT X700
Because it was really scary.  What's bothering me right now is I ain't got the energy for it, I would cough.  I would cough maybe one and @@@ you know.  Cause man what is this you know and so I would you know the next day and I would take it and I would cough.  Just a little simple cough you know.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
And I'd say hey, it could be something else cause I haven't taken the blood pressure pills for quite a while.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
And then @@@ I was taking you know.

DOCTOR X700
Maybe cutting them in half might help.

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X700
You can try that and the Plavix.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
And the cholesterol medication too and you can at least start with those three and then you can start that fourth blood pressure medication if you're tolerating.

PATIENT X700
Uh-huh yeah.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.  And the aspirin you did not take you said.

PATIENT X700
No.

DOCTOR X700
Do you want to pick it up?

PATIENT X700
Well see I was dealing with that since uh even before the heart attack.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
I just didn't take them on a regular basis like I was doing the aspirin, you know and it thins the blood so much you know.

DOCTOR X700
@@@.  You had your cholesterol checked in August and at that time it was still high so I want to recheck it actually, it's been a while since you've had it.  Uh @@@.

PATIENT X700
I understand okay.

DOCTOR X700
Do you cholesterol on and off.

PATIENT X700
Now there's one thing that I discussed with DOCTOR you know I have this problem a lot of times with making my appointments @@@ and I don't seem to @@@ forward to make the changes @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X700
Right.

PATIENT X700
Like it is now.

DOCTOR X700
Right.

PATIENT X700
With me not taking the medications for several days.

DOCTOR X700
What are the reasons that you don't want to come?  You don't feel bad or is it @@@.

PATIENT X700
Well no, there's always just something that pops up you know at the time you know.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh @@@.

PATIENT X700
That I needed to do.

DOCTOR X700
What would make it easier for you to come?

PATIENT X700
Well now, you know since I have this problem with the headaches and I can't just not take them is I just need to come and find out what the problem is.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.  @@@ what's going on.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
You know with the high cholesterol, how everything's going with it, heart attack with a stent and you don't feel it.

PATIENT X700
But that's really the problem because of the fact that I went so long with the high blood pressure if you noticed on my record, it's been a while and.

DOCTOR X700
And that's probably what made you, you know have the heart attack that and the smoking obviously.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
So @@@.

PATIENT X700
Yeah because at first I thought it was gas.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
@@@.  It just felt like it was @@@ like I was telling my wife you know, oh it’s just gas you know.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
She said I don't know, you need to probably get that checked out you know so it continued throughout the day off and on you know.  So that's when I stopped @@@ find out exactly what it is you know and then I was surprised when the doctor told me that uh you know I might have missed one you know so.

DOCTOR X700
If there's one thing that I want you to promise me is that you will take your Plavix.

PATIENT X700
Right.

DOCTOR X700
And @@@ your aspirin and at least one of your blood pressure medications and your cholesterol medication.  Those are the one thing that I want you to.

PATIENT X700
Because I was good on all of them especially when I first got home from the hospital you know I was taking them all every day and the first time I was @@@ but what set me back when I started getting the headaches you know.

DOCTOR X700
@@@.

PATIENT X700
We'll see it was something that would happen, it didn't happen before.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
I was given the medications and then when I got out the hospital and I started taking the new medications it started.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
You know it just started that way and I just had to wait until my blood changed or whatever @@@.

DOCTOR X700
Alright, I don't know @@@ medications.

PATIENT X700
Well.

DOCTOR X700
So now you're gonna be thinking it was the medications and you're not gonna want to take it.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
But we don't know for sure that's what it is.

PATIENT X700
Because you know when you, you know you think about the situation and think about what you have done before and what you have taken before and you didn't have this problem.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
You know so you start having this problem, you said it has to be some that's related to the medication.

DOCTOR X700
But you were on that medication before, the metoprolol.

PATIENT X700
Uh not all the medications I was on, that I'm on now.

DOCTOR X700
No, you were not always on this; you were on cholesterol pills which is in the same family as the lisinopril.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
So they were in the same family and you were on metoprolol which is the same medication that that had you on so we'll decrease it.

PATIENT X700
I can do that.  Okay.

DOCTOR X700
If that helps and the cholesterol medication seems like you're tolerating it.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
And the Plavix does not cause headaches.

PATIENT X700
No.

DOCTOR X700
In my @@@ Plavix.

PATIENT X700
Okay it won't.

DOCTOR X700
You barely even know you're taking it.

PATIENT X700
You @@@ what it was, so it wasn't something that could happen again, I have to do something, I'm doing now so maybe @@@.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
So something I came to the conclusion that it has to be the medication.

DOCTOR X700
Why don't we try it again on a lower dose then.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
Um and then just start with the metoprolol at 150 mg, the aspirin, the Plavix and um the cholesterol medication the simvastatin okay.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
Just those, those four.

PATIENT X700
Because it's something about uh the situation just like when I was having the prostate problem, I tolerate the situation for a while.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
Until it gets to the place where I can't tolerate it anymore and that's when I get up off of my tail and go get it checked out.

DOCTOR X700
Okay.

PATIENT X700
And with this here, I couldn't bear with possibly having these headaches.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.

PATIENT X700
You know throughout the day you know.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  75:11  DOCTOR IN:  80:51)

DOCTOR X700
Okay so I printed a copy out @@@ about the pump okay.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
And then the medications that I want you to take, take this with you okay.  This one, this is for the blood thinner for the stent, this is important okay.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
And this is for @@@.  And then this one you were already on.  This one I decreased to 100 only so that's probably will help the headaches okay and you can pick that up or you can just cut the pill you have at home in half.  Actually no, you can pick that up at the window and then this one wouldn't cause any problem so you can go ahead and take that, it's the cholesterol one.

PATIENT X700
Cholesterol one.

DOCTOR X700
And then the aspirin.

PATIENT X700
@@@ take this medication and see how it works but until I can do uh, @@@ the pump, can I start back on my pills?

DOCTOR X700
Yeah that should be fine absolutely.  It shouldn't be a problem I'll give you a prescription for it.

PATIENT X700
Okay.

DOCTOR X700
It probably will actually help with the blood pressure too.  Alright.  @@@ okay you better be taking these medications.

PATIENT X700
Yeah, I mean like I said the only reason, the only reason.

DOCTOR X700
@@@.

PATIENT X700
The only reason why I hadn't taken or continued to take it is because I didn't know which one was giving me the headaches.

DOCTOR X700
The next time call.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
At least call.  If you don't want to come in.

PATIENT X700
Right.

DOCTOR X700
Then just call.

PATIENT X700
I didn't know that I could, I thought I had to schedule.

DOCTOR X700
Right.  So I'll give you the number and I'll talk with DOCTOR and that will help you @@@.  You know @@@.

PATIENT X700
So.

DOCTOR X700
@@@ lot of it too to make sure @@@ okay.

PATIENT X700
That's the same thing my wife said and has been telling me that uh that it may be something that's entirely different @@@.  Really has changed my life.

DOCTOR X700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X700
To the fullest you know and I can't.

DOCTOR X700
You're too young; you're too young to go okay.

PATIENT X700
Yeah.

DOCTOR X700
So take care of yourself.

PATIENT X700
That's why I'm here.

DOCTOR X700
I'm glad you came @@@.

PATIENT X700
@@@.

DOCTOR X700
You have to come here more.

PATIENT X700
Yes I will, yeah I will, like I said I just um got certain things in front of it, at least my appointment would be, it would be on a day when something else that.

DOCTOR X700
Nothing's more important than your health.

PATIENT X700
Right.  Alright.

DOCTOR X700
Nothing.

PATIENT X700
Believe me, @@@ I'll @@@ constantly with my wife you know.

DOCTOR X700
I know, I'm not trying to be naggy.

PATIENT X700
No it's great but you know, for me it has to be close because it's nice you know I laugh with you, like with my prostate all we did is I waited @@@ I could have got the surgery a long time ago.

DOCTOR X700
Right.

PATIENT X700
But I kept putting it off, putting it off, putting it off and putting it off.

DOCTOR X700
Right.

PATIENT X700
Even waited until it got so serious I was going to the Emergency Room @@@.  So I got the @@@.

DOCTOR X700
You can't do that with this problem cause it'll almost kill you.  If it's gonna get worse it's gonna get worse I'm not gonna tell you @@@.

PATIENT X700
Right, right, right, right.

DOCTOR X700
It's different.

PATIENT X700
Okay doc.  @@@.

DOCTOR X700
@@@.

PATIENT X700
@@@.

DOCTOR X700
Yeah don't forget it.

PATIENT X700
I won't.

DOCTOR X700
Have a nice weekend.

PATIENT X700
Okay, thanks a lot now.

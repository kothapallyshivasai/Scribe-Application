DOCTOR X138
@@@ I think you're supposed to be my 3:30 but if you want to go early.  Okay.  We just kind of have to be a little quicker so let's put next to the 1:30 so @@@ can get them in okay.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
Unless you want to wait.

PATIENT X138
No that's fine.

DOCTOR X138
You'd rather come in?

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138
Okay, come on in.  I'm DOCTOR and I think you already have a doctor.  I think DOCTOR is your doctor right?

PATIENT X138
I'm not sure.  

DOCTOR X138
He saw you in March.

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138
Yeah.  So what brings you in today?

PATIENT X138
Uh I had an appointment to see the doctor and I wanted to know when it would be possible to get into a group.

DOCTOR X138
What kind of group?

PATIENT X138
Uh.

DOCTOR X138
You'll have to come over here, we can talk and I can go through your chart up at the same time.  Okay. What kind of group?

PATIENT X138
You know any kind of group where you sit down and start saying things.

DOCTOR X138
Like a mental health group or?

PATIENT X138
@@@.

DOCTOR X138
What's bothering you?

PATIENT X138
Oh, uh it's hard for me to explain reality.

DOCTOR X138
Give me an example.

PATIENT X138
I keep seeing monsters and seeing people dying.

DOCTOR X138
But it's not real as far as you know?

PATIENT X138
I can feel just it just about @@@ going to the bathroom.

DOCTOR X138
So you feel like you're kind of seeing a few things?  When did this start?

PATIENT X138
In 71.

DOCTOR X138
So you're kind of seeing into the future.

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  What's your past medical history?  What else do you have wrong?

PATIENT X138
@@@ I need an operation on my leg.

DOCTOR X138
Do you have heart disease?

PATIENT X138
I had three stents put in.

DOCTOR X138
When was that?

PATIENT X138
Just about two months ago.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  What else?

PATIENT X138
They had to operate on my eye too.

DOCTOR X138
The @@@ data has you've had some heart disease um, he talked about where do you have screws in your, in your leg?

PATIENT X138
Right here, right here.

DOCTOR X138
So in the right knee, you had a right knee surgery and that's all really.  You don't have too much going on, in terms of chronic medical things.

PATIENT X138
And it's hard for me to see.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  Do you see a psychiatrist?

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am, I just started coming here.

DOCTOR X138
Okay they just saw you on June 30th and you told them, are you taking the sleeping pill they gave you?

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138
Are you taking the olanzapine and sertraline?

PATIENT X138
Yes.

DOCTOR X138
And is that helping these symptoms?

PATIENT X138
No.

DOCTOR X138
We might just have to send you back to the Mental Health Center.  You know you have this condition which is atypical psychosis.

PATIENT X138
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X138
You know that's what those medications are for.

PATIENT X138
I see.

DOCTOR X138
But if they're not controlling your symptoms then you probably need those medications to be changed.

PATIENT X138
Okay.  I understand.  Could you make them a little stronger @@@?

DOCTOR X138
I can't, but we're going to send you to them.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
Hopefully today.  Hold on just a second.  The other question I had, I'm looking at your Mental Health Note from June 30th and they said that they gave you an appointment to come and see me um because you were having a cough and nasal congestion.  Are you still having that?

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138
Well why don't we take care of that problem since you're here.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
And then I'll call over to Mental Health and see if we can follow up over there today.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  Tell me about the cough.

PATIENT X138
Oh, it's hard for me to @@@.

DOCTOR X138
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT X138
The last month.

DOCTOR X138
Okay so you have sore throat.  When does the cough happen the most?  At night or during the day?

PATIENT X138
At night.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  Does it keep you up?

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  Um do you ever have like a sour taste in your mouth?

PATIENT X138

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  AT nighttime?

PATIENT X138

PATIENT X138
No but I do have hay fever.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  Are you taking that loratadine that they gave you?

PATIENT X138
Yes.

DOCTOR X138
Does that help?

PATIENT X138
Somewhat.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  So you've been taking @@@ for about a month.

PATIENT X138

DOCTOR X138

PATIENT X138
Fever.  I had a fever.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  Any trouble breathing?

PATIENT X138

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  When you cough are you bringing anything up?

PATIENT X138
Yeah.

DOCTOR X138
What types of stuff?

PATIENT X138
Mucous.

DOCTOR X138
What color?

PATIENT X138
Sometimes it'll be yellow.

DOCTOR X138
Do you have any other complaints today or just the initial complaint?

PATIENT X138
I need to sleep, I'm tired.

DOCTOR X138
Okay did you try that medicine they gave you?

PATIENT X138
I didn't do nothing @@@.

DOCTOR X138
Do you have the number for the @@@?  Let me see if this is the number.  Do you think you'd like to go over there and see somebody so they could change your medicines?

PATIENT X138
If you send me I'll go.

DOCTOR X138
Let me call them.  I don't know if this is the right number but we'll try.  I'm looking at your meds now and you know.  Did you try the cough syrup they gave you?

PATIENT X138
Yes.

DOCTOR X138
Did it help?

PATIENT X138
No, no.

DOCTOR X138
Any of kind of pain @@@ here?

(Doctor made phone call in the room with patient)

DOCTOR X138
They'll see you right when we're done okay.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
So you take this omeprazole medicine, do you know that one?

PATIENT X138
Yeah.

DOCTOR X138
So the omeprazole you can take maybe at nighttime instead of in the morning and maybe that'll help your cough.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
You sound like you're laying down and maybe you're getting acid reflux.

PATIENT X138
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X138
So maybe we can change that medicine to twice a day.  You take it in the morning and at night.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
And hopefully that'll help your cough.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
So that sounds good?

PATIENT X138
Yeah.

DOCTOR X138
I'm going to take a listen though and make sure your lungs sound good and then we'll get you on your way and I can have you take that medicine twice a day.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
Here have a seat over here.  Do you know where the Intake Center is on the first floor of Building 228?

PATIENT X138
Uh, @@@.  On my way back home.

DOCTOR X138
Do you know where 228 is, the Mental Health Building?

PATIENT X138
@@@ where I just come from?

DOCTOR X138
Yes.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
And then you go to where it says Intake.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
Um you're not having any voices telling you to hurt yourself or anything?

PATIENT X138
Yesterday I did.

DOCTOR X138
You did?

PATIENT X138
Weird sounds and I have been getting @@@.

DOCTOR X138
Do you think you need to go to the Emergency Room instead or would you rather try going.  Have you ever had that happen to you before?

PATIENT X138
Twice before.

DOCTOR X138
What happened then, did you just go to Mental Health?

PATIENT X138
Uh-huh yeah.

DOCTOR X138
And they helped you with your medicines?

PATIENT X138
Yeah.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  So I'm going to take a quick listen okay.  Take a deep breath.  Have you ever used an inhaler?

PATIENT X138
Uh yes.

DOCTOR X138
Do you want to try one now to help your cough?

PATIENT X138
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X138
And do you want me to mail it to you or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT X138
Probably pick them up.

DOCTOR X138
Okay.  Now this medicine, you can take two puffs, so two inhales um every six hours as you need it okay.

PATIENT X138
Alright.

DOCTOR X138
So see if it helps.  Now real quick, let me just look through here.  So what exactly are the voices telling you to do?

PATIENT X138
@@@.

DOCTOR X138
Okay and how are they telling you to hurt yourself?  What do they say?

PATIENT X138
I can do better than what I'm doing @@@.

DOCTOR X138
They want your help, okay.  You need to feel better than this right?  So I think this is probably the best option to go to the first floor, 228.

PATIENT X138
@@@.

DOCTOR X138
I wrote it on here for you.  Um.  So and you're going to Building 228 first floor Mental Health Intake.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
Okay so maybe if you get lost you can ask someone, you know Building 228.

PATIENT X138
Okay.

DOCTOR X138
It's like that way.

PATIENT X138
Alright.

DOCTOR X138
You go to the first floor and then instead of going out the front you kind of walk to the other building right?

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138
So I'll be right back but here's this that you'll need.  I'll be right back you stay here for a minute.

PATIENT X138

(DOCTOR OUT:  50:12  DOCTOR IN:  56:55

DOCTOR X138
Alright come on.  We got someone to walk you over so you won't get lost.

PATIENT X138

DOCTOR X138
I was worried because I'm not exactly sure where this @@@ is either so, we might as well send someone who knows exactly where you're going.

PATIENT X138
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X138

PATIENT X138

PATIENT X706

DOCTOR X706
Okay.  You probably have a bronchitis.  Do you know what that is, bronchitis?

PATIENT X706
Hmm, a breathing problem?

DOCTOR X706
It's like an infection in the central airway where bacteria can grow easily.  I don't think it's in the lungs, your lungs sound very good but you probably have a bronchitis which is inflammation of the bronchi or tracheitis. 

SECOND PERSON X706
Yeah.

DOCTOR X706
Um with the fevers and chills you say you've been having as well, we might want to give you a similar antibiotics to what the doctor gave you when you saw him in February, the azithromycin antibiotics that you took back then.  We'll probably give you some @@@ to break up the mucous @@@ so I'm gonna go and talk with um my boss and we'll get it worked out okay.  Then I'll come back and we'll talk more.  You just wait here and I'll come go talk to him and be right back.

DOCTOR X706
You'll wait.

PATIENT X706
Yeah.

DOCTOR X706
It's a good thing to have in this season, especially this year with all the comorbidities that you have, the high blood pressure; you know the hypertension and the hyperlipidemia.

PATIENT X706
Would I get it once I leave here?

DOCTOR X706
We can give it to you still when you leave today.  Probably a good idea for you.

PATIENT X706
Okay.

DOCTOR X706

PATIENT X706
Yeah.

DOCTOR X706
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT X706
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  71:03  DOCTOR IN:  79:20)

DOCTOR X706
You're gonna have an EKG done while you're here okay.

PATIENT X706
Okay.

DOCTOR X706
And um and we're gonna order some tests because some of the symptoms that you describe are you know a little bit concerning due to your risk factors there may be something going on with your heart okay.  So we're gonna have you go over and uh they're gonna take the EKG now.  Do you know what an EKG is?  They put those little things on there to check the electricity of the heart and then um I'll have you go over to the Heart Clinic and then they'll schedule you for a couple of tests.  One is a stress test; do you know what a stress test is?

PATIENT X706
No I heard about it.

DOCTOR X706
Yeah.  Basically um they give you some medications to put a little bit of stress on the heart, makes you breathe fast when it makes the vessels dilate, putting a little stress on the heart and then they take images of the heart and they see if there's any evidence if there's a block of blood flow in the heart.  That's called a stress test.  So they put stress on the heart and they visualize significant @@@ and um so we can have that scheduled.  It's probably not going to be able to get done today but we can have you go over there and they'll check.  Um we're also going to do a lung test, a pulmonary function test considering you're a smoker and with your symptoms that you have now um you probably have something called COPD or emphysema @@@.  So we'll have to see, not now but we'll schedule it you know with your cough and so on, but once that's resolved we should schedule you to get that done.  Basically @@@ your lungs.  


(Someone knocked on the door)  The EKG technician tells the patient to prepare and he'll come back with the machine.

PATIENT X706
Okay.

DOCTOR X706
The pulmonary test you'll sit in a little, kind of in a box and then they'll give you a tube that you breathe into pretty hard and then they measure the volume of your lungs, it's called a pulmonary function test and we'll get that checked as well.  And then we'll also I'll give you some antibiotics and some medication to loosen the phlegm so you can cough it out and that'll help as well.

PATIENT X706
That's like if I want to see a dentist I have to talk to my primary doctor.

DOCTOR X706
Yes.  We could possibly, um I can refer you over there to see if they'll see you or not.  I don't know.  It's a little bit more complicated than that like they have all sorts of conditions allowing you to be seen in the Dental Clinic but we can refer you.  Yes.  The EKG technician performs the EKG.

DOCTOR X706
What's your phone number PATIENT?

PATIENT X706
Uh NUMBER.

DOCTOR X706

(DOCTOR OUT:  90:31  DOCTOR IN:  91:14)

DOCTOR X706
You can put your shirt back on.  So if this chest pain comes back you should definitely come in to Urgent Care or the Emergency Room to evaluate it okay.  

PATIENT X706

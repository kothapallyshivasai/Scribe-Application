PATIENT X379
And the guy said this one's expired.

DOCTOR X379
@@@ oh.

PATIENT X379
But he's gonna put it through if nothing changes.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
So you just gotta add it on.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Oh I guess it just expired this past week or two.

PATIENT X379
Yeah right cause they won't give it to you, you know.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  I'll renew it.

PATIENT X379
And check that one, I thought that one was expired too but he said no.

DOCTOR X379
Nifedipine, no that one's not expired and you still have, yeah you still have refills on that too.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

DOCTOR X379
That other one should be okay.  Oh we saw you in June right?

PATIENT X379
Uh I think so yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Um how are you doing with your shoulder?

PATIENT X379
Uh the same.

DOCTOR X379
Same.  Um.

PATIENT X379
But I do need to see my leg doctor.

DOCTOR X379
Who's your leg doctor?

PATIENT X379
I don't know.

DOCTOR X379
What was your leg problem oh okay for your PVD um?  How are your legs doing right now?

PATIENT X379
No I'm on, they're gonna have to go in.

DOCTOR X379
You think so?

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
And it's getting worse.

PATIENT X379
Yeah I would say a little worse yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  No pain when walking?

PATIENT X379
It's more like when I sleep you know.

DOCTOR X379
Not as much when you're walking?

PATIENT X379
I can walk and yeah sometime if I walk a long way you know.

DOCTOR X379
Will your leg cramp up?

PATIENT X379
Sometimes at night yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
That's pretty painful too.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  It wakes you up?

PATIENT X379
Yeah you wake up and all of a sudden, so I'd like them to look at it.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  You saw the Hem/Onc before right because you had that high white count?

PATIENT X379
Pardon me?

DOCTOR X379
The Hematology/Oncology people?

PATIENT X379
Yes.

DOCTOR X379
You saw them okay.  Your @@@ was normal.  Then did they say anything?  You saw them again in September.

PATIENT X379
Right.

DOCTOR X379
Okay let's see.

PATIENT X379
I saw DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X379
DOCTOR yeah.

PATIENT X379
DOCTOR yeah and she said I'll see her in six months.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
And she gave me a lot of blood work.

DOCTOR X379
She did.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
I don't know what the results were or anything but.

DOCTOR X379
I think one thing was negative they were looking for.  They think maybe because you smoke it could be why your white counts a little bit high.  It can happen with smoking.

PATIENT X379
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Um but you had a negative x-ray and everything like that so.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Um there's one more test where they check some kind of gene, that's still pending that they're gonna follow up with you once you.

PATIENT X379
Is that the one in your back?

DOCTOR X379
No its called BCR-ABL.  I'm sure it's not something that people usually hear of.  It's just a type of gene they test for it.

PATIENT X379
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X379
Yeah.  Okay.  And you saw the GU people, the Urology.  Has your prostate biopsy been scheduled on the 1st?

PATIENT X379
I didn't schedule nothing.  I told them I didn't want the test.

DOCTOR X379
Okay you don't want it.

PATIENT X379
And they sent me a enema thing and some pills and.

DOCTOR X379
You don't want to do it?

PATIENT X379
Not right now.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
He said well we're gonna bring you back in February.  I said okay let's see how it is then and then I go home and a week later I got a box with that stuff in it.  Kind of ticked me off cause they're forcing me you know.

DOCTOR X379
I mean I think you just have to tell them you don't want it.  I don't know if it was really clear that.

PATIENT X379
Yeah this guy didn't want no for an answer is what it was.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Okay.  Okay that's fine, whenever you're ready to do that, it's on the list so that if you don't get it done.

PATIENT X379
Right, right.

DOCTOR X379
So I think that's the only reason.  The risk is you know it could be prostate cancer and you're not catching it.

PATIENT X379
Right, right, I understand.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
Well what were my numbers?  Did she take?

DOCTOR X379
Um the most recent one you have is on August 10th and it was 6.79.

PATIENT X379
Alright.

DOCTOR X379
You've been high before so I'm not @@@.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

DOCTOR X379
So this is the highest.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
You're been is 6.79.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
If you want us to follow it, we can follow it in clinic.  If at any point you feel like it's kind of high, there's no, I mean usually when it's this high they just do it cause there's no real way to tell until you take the biopsy you know.

PATIENT X379
Right.

DOCTOR X379
It could be high for no, any other reason.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
You know because your prostate's big.

PATIENT X379
Right now the next time I see you and uh.

DOCTOR X379
We can check it.

PATIENT X379
I.

DOCTOR X379
Were you, do you want us to check it?

PATIENT X379
Yeah, right, yeah.  When I can take a blood test before I come and see you?

DOCTOR X379
Yeah just remind me.

PATIENT X379
Okay.  That's cool.

DOCTOR X379
We can do that.  You got the flu shot?

PATIENT X379
Uh yeah I just took it.

DOCTOR X379
Um what about your weight loss?  How's that going?

PATIENT X379
Uh always trying.

DOCTOR X379
Always trying.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Still eating out?

PATIENT X379
Yeah for the most part you know.

DOCTOR X379
About the same since I last, for the past month or so.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT X379
Better than gaining.  Yeah I'd like to lose some but it's hard at my age I don't know.  And then I heard the medicine I'm taking cause of diabetes it's harder, I don't know if that's true.

DOCTOR X379
Uh-huh.  Did you see the pharmacist at all?

PATIENT X379
Uh I think I did.

DOCTOR X379
The clinical signs do you know.  I think you, oh there we go, you saw the pharmacist.  Have you seen the eye doctors?  When did you last see them?  Did you see them this year already?  The eye doctors?

PATIENT X379
I believe so.  I usually go every six months.

DOCTOR X379
Uh you saw them in July last year.

PATIENT X379
Okay so I'm due huh.

DOCTOR X379
You're due.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

DOCTOR X379
So we'll have you just follow up with them.

PATIENT X379
Right.

DOCTOR X379
And you're taking the 60 units twice a day for your diabetes?

PATIENT X379
No I just take one shot.

DOCTOR X379
Oh in @@@.

PATIENT X379
One yes, yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Try splitting it.  That's what I think she wanted you to do.

PATIENT X379
Right she mentioned something about it.

DOCTOR X379
Yeah.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Just split it okay.

PATIENT X379
Yeah it's just hard sticking you twice a day, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X379
Uh-huh.  And then.

PATIENT X379
She said it would work better.

DOCTOR X379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X379
Because instead of jamming it all at once you know.  I guess I should so.

DOCTOR X379
The A1c was high I remember the last time we saw you.  And you're still on the metformin 1 gram twice a day?  How much of the metformin do you take again?

PATIENT X379
Take four pills a day.

DOCTOR X379
Four pills a day okay.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.  Did you put that in already?

DOCTOR X379
Yeah I'll put it in, I'll remember.  Uh we need to get your A1c again and you need to see @@@ and then we'll have you see me, let's see.  When was the last time you saw your @@@ doctors, has it been a while?  I might have to put a new consult in.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X379
Right now you'll put it in and then they'll call me or just send me a letter?

DOCTOR X379
@@@ making out here.  Let me take a listen to you while you're up here.  Take some deep breaths.  Still smoking?

PATIENT X379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X379
How much?  Still the same?

PATIENT X379
The same.

DOCTOR X379
No swelling?  Okay, okay, have a seat.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X379
Yes.  Can you leave it open?

DOCTOR X379
Sure.

PATIENT X379
Thank you.

DOCTOR OUT:  30:29  DOCTOR IN:  42:51

SECOND DOCTOR X379
@@@ hey.  I'm DOCTOR I'll be checking your legs.

PATIENT X379
Hi.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
I wanted to get a better sense of what's going on with you, what the symptoms are on your legs so if you can tell me in your own words.

PATIENT X379
They uh sometimes feel like they're asleep I guess would be the best.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
Best way to describe what happens you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Like a numbness, tingling type of pain?

PATIENT X379
Yeah and then I get up and I walk and it's alright then you now.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
But I uh I've had this for years and I know when they don't feel right and I feel at this time they don't feel right.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
You're not feeling right.  Okay.

PATIENT X379
Right so.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
So you had a diagnosis that this is related to your diabetes, a neuropathy?  Have you ever heard of that before?

PATIENT X379
Isn't that with your feet?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Yeah.  Like the numbness, tingling or pain.

PATIENT X379
I have uh nerve damage in my feet.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Is this what it feels; is it how your symptoms have been feeling in the past?

PATIENT X379
Uh, oh my feet are bad to begin with and uh but my legs they just seem to be uh not as good as before and they usually go in, you know with uh, I forgot what they call it.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Angiogram.

PATIENT X379
Yeah right, instead of going to your heart they go into your legs.  I've had that done uh two, maybe three times.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
Because I've had blood clots in my, where they put stents in.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Oh you have stents okay.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
How far can you walk without having to stop from cramps?

PATIENT X379
I probably can go uh a good block.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
Maybe more you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Has that been stable cause it looked like in 2010 you were able to go about a block?

PATIENT X379
I, you know my walking hasn't changed that much.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Okay but just when you go to bed you notice more of a falling asleep sensation.

PATIENT X379
Right, right.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Can you take off your shoes and socks, let me take a look.  So that's a pretty invasive test that angiogram @@@.  I want to make sure that that's what we think is going on.

PATIENT X379
Well they don't, they go in, you know here.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Yeah, yeah.  No, no, I know.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.  My toes are bad so.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Your toes are bad?  Okay.

PATIENT X379
I mean my nails because I'm going Monday.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Oh okay, let's take a look.  Now you feel all throughout here, your whole leg?

PATIENT X379
No it's just from right here down.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Just from here down.  Now do your fingers having any of this sensation?

PATIENT X379
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.  Can you feel it when I touch you?

PATIENT X379
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Close your eyes, tell me when you feel something.

PATIENT X379
Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
You have great pulses.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Pulses.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
But the micro stick, your toes are nice and warm which is a good sign.
PATIENT X379
Good.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
That they're getting good blood.

PATIENT X379
Okay, right.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
So.  So the question is is this nerve or is this a blood flow problem or is this a nerve problem because diabetes can also cause the nerve to get that numbness, tingling.

PATIENT X379
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Nerve sensation.  Um we can do a test called an EMG which can help us with that and we can also check the ABIs to see if they've gotten worse and that gabapentin, do you remember that gabapentin medication that you take three times a day?  That was probably started for neuropathy.

PATIENT X379
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Do you want to go up on that dose; see if that helps a little bit with your symptoms?

PATIENT X379
Sure if you think it'll help.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
We'll try it.  We'll kind of try it um cause if it was blood.  If it was a blood flow problem and it's happening at rest I think what I would expect is when you start walking it would get much worse.  This doesn't sound like the case.  It seems like you're still being able to walk about a block or whatever is your baseline.

PATIENT X379
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
So um I'm wondering if this is a different process than a blood flow problem, it may be a nerve problem.  But we also want to test the muscle @@@.  Okay so the plan is to go up on gabapentin, check A1c, check ABIs and CBC.  Sound like a plan?  You don't understand anything I said.  All the letters.  So we're gonna check the nerves, blood flow and muscles. 

PATIENT X379
Some tests or something?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Yes.

PATIENT X379
What kind of tests?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
And your ABIs are the blood pressure where they check the pressure of the blood vessel. 

PATIENT X379
I've had that done yes okay.  Where they put blood pressure cuffs on you?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Yeah.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
To see if that's compromised and then one is a blood test and the EMG is they test the nerve conduction in your legs.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Alright.

PATIENT X379
Before I'm gonna go see that other guy right?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
I think so.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

DOCTOR X379
I think that it's leaning towards something else other than vascular.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Vascular meaning blood @@@.

PATIENT X379
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Cause the @@@ can be single so something is giving @@@.

PATIENT X379
Right.  Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
So you don't get those cramps like um @@@.

PATIENT X379
Sometimes.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Sometimes.

PATIENT X379
Yeah.

DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
Very painful.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay.  You can check his electrolytes.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
No @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Okay, we have a plan in place alright.

PATIENT X379
Electrolytes.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Electrolytes.

PATIENT X379
Should I be drinking Gatorade?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Well we're gonna check.  Probably not.  So most commonly it's not an abnormality.

PATIENT X379
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
But we'll make sure your tests @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
90 @@@ right for the gabapentin?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X379
Can I put?

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Yeah.

PATIENT X379
Thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR X379
Sure.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Can you get lab work done today?

PATIENT X379
Pardon me?

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Can you get the lab work done today?  Are you able to on your way out?

PATIENT X379
Sure.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Okay.

PATIENT X379
I don't have to fast or not right?

FIRST DOCTOR X379
No it's not for the fasting.  That way I can call you on your way out.  Labs today okay.

PATIENT X379
Alright no problem.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Sounds good.  Okay, A1c.  Okay.  Alright I think you're all set.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
I'll renew your medications, I will, I'll remember it and I'd like to put a few other things in for you okay.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
And they'll schedule your Ophtho out there for your eyes okay, the Ophthalmology, the eye doctors.

PATIENT X379
Okay they'll schedule that for me now?

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Yeah cause it's September 4th and then increase your gabapentin, take an extra pill every eight hours.  You're taking two pills right, every eight.

PATIENT X379
Every eight, yeah I take six a day.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Six a day yeah so you're being put on nine, take three every eight hours okay.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
And I'll send you more in the mail so it'll be sent so you don't run out.

PATIENT X379
Alright, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
And they'll schedule you for that muscle test and the blood pressure tests okay.  It's called an EMG and ABIs.

PATIENT X379
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Alright.

PATIENT X379
They'll send me a letter then?

FIRST DOCTOR X379
They can probably set @@@ now.

PATIENT X379
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Yeah.  Okay. 

PATIENT X379
Alright I guess that's it.

FIRST DOCTOR X379
Alright, yep.  I'll put that in for you okay.

PATIENT X379
Okay.  I'll see you in three months?

FIRST DOCTOR X379

Alrighty.

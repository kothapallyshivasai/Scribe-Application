PATIENT X97
@@@.

DOCTOR X97
You missed your eye appointment.

PATIENT X97
Yes @@@.

DOCTOR X97
We'll get you an Ophtho for you.  Alright so you had recent labs.  In January when you got labs most recently.

PATIENT X97
@@@.  What about the uh Podiatry appointment?

DOCTOR X97
Now I'm going to put it in but you haven't proven too successful at this point.

PATIENT X97
I know, you know.  I was thinking about the @@@ on Holster.

DOCTOR X97
Well I don't know why they're not getting a hold of you.  Do you have any ideas?

PATIENT X97
No because uh, usually it's either on my voice mail or my son is there, one of the two and they know to give me a call.  But I have a cell phone.

DOCTOR X97
Did you give them that number?

PATIENT X97
No I didn't.

DOCTOR X97
Well I highly recommend it.  When you go to check out in the front you need to give them that number.

PATIENT X97
Okay.

DOCTOR X97
Are you having the chest pain still?

PATIENT X97
Yeah I haven't had any more since.  I got this again and @@@ to get an appointment.

DOCTOR X97
Okay.  You got to do me a favor my friend though.

PATIENT X97
What's that?

DOCTOR X97
You got to start showing up for your stuff.  You see me every time but I can't ever help you because you don't go for other stuff okay.

PATIENT X97
Now, let me understand you can move it.

DOCTOR X97
Yeah I'll move it, all of your stuff will be assigned to @@@ also.

PATIENT X97
Okay.  But other than that, I do recall missing was the eye appointment.  Now the stress test I don't know but what I be thinking is that usually, the way I know about that appointment is you just send through the mail.  You know sometimes they'll call @@@ appointment, the confirmed the eye appointment but I just got tied up for that appointment but I @@@.  But the stress test I don't remember that.  @@@ you want me to get in touch with you.

DOCTOR X97
I think so.

PATIENT X97
But my son he has a computer and he be playing with the video games, sometimes he don't answer the phone and @@@.

DOCTOR X97
Alright and the @@@ doctors can’t do anything for you until we get all this stuff figured out.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X97
Okay.

PATIENT X97
Well what am I supposed to do about my foot, @@@?

DOCTOR X97
Well you get to Podiatry.  I can't help you.  I mean there's nothing I can do for your feet okay.  Lotion is the best thing, that's all I know.  They probably need to biopsy the skin.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X97
Okay and give you special shoes.

PATIENT X97
But what I think @@@ I think there's a piece of glass in my foot.

DOCTOR X97
That doesn't cause blisters, but I'll take a look at it.

PATIENT X97
Yeah because I had uh, especially when @@@.

DOCTOR X97
They're not painful right?

PATIENT X97
What the blisters?  Yes they are.

DOCTOR X97
They are.  Take them off and let me see.  I'm going to take care of your feet.  I'm more worried about your heart and your liver working so you need to survive.

PATIENT X97
Alright.

DOCTOR X97
Right.

PATIENT X97
Alright.

DOCTOR X97
We got to get you that stress test.  Your blood pressure's too high still.

PATIENT X97
That's because I'm in a lot of pain with my foot.  @@@ right in the middle.

DOCTOR X97
Uh-huh and I'll check your vitals and we'll check it in a second.

PATIENT X97
The blisters had on my feet @@@.

DOCTOR X97
Are you taking your blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT X97
Yes.

DOCTOR X97
Every single one of them?  Do you know which ones you're taking?

PATIENT X97
Yes.

DOCTOR X97
Which ones?

PATIENT X97
Name them?

DOCTOR X97
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X97
Uh metoprolol or whatever it is.

DOCTOR X97
Metoprolol good.

PATIENT X97
And the uh lisinopril.

DOCTOR X97
Good.

PATIENT X97
And uh a water pill.

DOCTOR X97
Hydrochlorothiazide good.

PATIENT X97
Yeah I tell you I wasn't taking that other one because it @@@.

DOCTOR X97
@@@ okay that's fine.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.  See I take @@@.

DOCTOR X97
Okay.  Have you ever tried the Telebuddy System?

PATIENT X97
What's that?

DOCTOR X97
Where they actually call you about your blood pressure every day and you submit it electronically?

PATIENT X97
No, I got a blood pressure gauge.

DOCTOR X97
Would you like that?

PATIENT X97
What for that.

DOCTOR X97
You take your blood pressure at home with a certain machine that submits it electronically so we get the information.

PATIENT X97
Okay.

DOCTOR X97
Because your blood pressure has been too high for over a year and a half now.

PATIENT X97
It goes low once I get home.  The last time I took it at home it was about 120.

DOCTOR X97
Okay.

PATIENT X97
@@@ you know.

DOCTOR X97
Okay what is it running at home though?

PATIENT X97
Uh for the last uh month or so it's been running like about 129/80, in the lower 80s something like that.

DOCTOR X97
Okay well then I think it'd be good to have you have blood pressures at home then.  Look at ours, every single one that we have here.

PATIENT X97
I think I be, it's a little more stressful for me to come up here.

DOCTOR X97
I'm sure it is.  I'm a stressful person.

PATIENT X97
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X97
Well see we've only got these here.  That’s why I think it'd good for you to have one of those Telebuddy Systems then we'd know what your blood pressure is at home.

PATIENT X97
Okay.

DOCTOR X97
Cause you're right, your blood pressure may be better at home but I can't know that until we check it at home and I find out the answer okay.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X97
So let's try that alright.  Alright, you also need to be on a cholesterol medicine that we need to add today.

PATIENT X97
Cholesterol.

DOCTOR X97
Your cholesterol is too high.  Your bad cholesterol we want for you less than 70 and yours is 134.  We need to cut your cholesterol in half okay.  And for that reason, I think you need to go on Zocor or Lipitor which is a cholesterol medicine alrighty.

PATIENT X97
@@@.

DOCTOR X97
You're African-American; you're almost 50 years old.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X97
You have hypertension and diabetes so right there those are four.

PATIENT X97
Hepatitis C.

DOCTOR X97
What, well hepatitis C is pretty much equivalent to diabetes, in my mind it is diabetes okay.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X97
You have four things okay that would put you at risk for heart attacks.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X97
Which will now give you five with high cholesterol so all of these things we need to treat.  We're trying to treat your blood pressure, we can't change your race, we change your age okay.

PATIENT X97
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X97
But we can change your cholesterol.

PATIENT X97
So what was that pill I was on.

DOCTOR X97
The cholesterol.

PATIENT X97
I know, I mean you were saying the name, what kind of side effects is there?

DOCTOR X97
Side effects, the only kind of side effects is it might cause a little bit of muscle ache, so it's the most prescribed pills in America, is Lipitor.

PATIENT X97
Yeah I've heard that.

DOCTOR X97
Yeah.  @@@ save lives.

PATIENT X97
Okay.

DOCTOR X97
Okay.  So we'll put you on a low dose and increase it as you need it.

PATIENT X97
Alright.

DOCTOR X97
That sound good, I think it's important.  Alright.  Are you still taking the meloxicam?

PATIENT X97
Yes.

DOCTOR X97
Good.  Is that working for you?

PATIENT X97
Hmm so so.

DOCTOR X97

PATIENT X97
So how would I go about @@@ Telebuddy @@@.  Are they calling me or what?  Do I have to do something with that?

DOCTOR X97

DOCTOR X97
That's the only thing @@@.  These are rubbing blisters.

PATIENT X97
Are they?

DOCTOR X97
Yeah I mean they look very much like rubbing blisters to me.  Okay.  It's possible though that it's causing inflammation because you're rubbing like this.  That may feel better if you pop it a little bit.

PATIENT X97
I did.

DOCTOR X97
Okay.

PATIENT X97

DOCTOR X97

DOCTOR X164
How you doing?  How are you doing today?

PATIENT X164
Okay.
 
DOCTOR X164
So how have you been?

PATIENT X164
Doing pretty good.

DOCTOR X164
Any um, do you have any pain?

PATIENT X164
Oh I kind of just started a little bit.

DOCTOR X164
Still there though?

PATIENT X164
Off and on but mostly not.

DOCTOR X164
Um.  When do you get the pain now?

PATIENT X164
If it's there, it's during bowel movements.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  Any blood in your stool?

PATIENT X164
No.

DOCTOR X164
On a scale of 1-10 how bad is the pain?

PATIENT X164
Uh when it comes it's not that bad, maybe 1 or 2.

DOCTOR X164
Okay um.  Well the CT scan that we got of your pelvis.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
And the abdomen um, it didn't show any infection or masses around your rectum.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
But it did show kind of a signal in your pancreas that we don't know what it would be.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
And so the radiologist wanted to repeat a dedicated CT of just the pancreas.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
Um so, I'd like to do that and also I think that we should send you for a colonoscopy um.  We try, did you do four weeks of antibiotics or two weeks.

PATIENT X164
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR X164
Did you do antibiotics for four weeks or two weeks?

PATIENT X164
Um well you gave it to me I was on that so, it's been about four I would say.

DOCTOR X164
I think the last time we gave you; we gave you two weeks with one refill.  No we gave you four weeks worth.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  Um okay.  We checked your cholesterol on the 25th of August.

PATIENT X164
Right.

DOCTOR X164
And that was high.

PATIENT X164
It was high?

DOCTOR X164
Yeah.  But your bad cholesterol was 162 and so um it should really be and you don't have any diabetes?

PATIENT X164
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X164
No history of heart attack or anything like that?

PATIENT X164
No.

DOCTOR X164
Um so it should really be under 130 and then your total cholesterol was 238 and that should be under 200.

PATIENT X164
Hmm.

DOCTOR X164
Um the reason I always get cholesterol levels is because it's found that there's an increased risk of heart attack and stroke with high cholesterol.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
And so for the long term the blended measure um, so there are medications that can decrease your cholesterol called statins, simvastatin and Lipitor.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh, yeah I'm familiar with it.

DOCTOR X164
So have you ever been on it at any in the past?

PATIENT X164
Yeah like maybe ten years ago I was on it for a little while.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  Why did you stop?

PATIENT X164
I just didn't refill the medication.

DOCTOR X164
Did you have any muscle cramps or pain?

PATIENT X164
No, I don't know if it was the result of the medications but sometimes I get cramps in my leg but you know maybe that's from running and stuff.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  The biggest complaint people have is sometimes they get muscle pains.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
If that's the case then we just stop it and give you a different medication to try.  Um we also need to monitor your liver enzymes.  Sometimes people when they start the medications the liver, your liver processes the drug.

PATIENT X164
Right.

DOCTOR X164
Sometimes people's livers can respond by increasing the enzymes.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
And so if it increases too high then we have to stop the drug as well.

PATIENT X164
Hmm.

DOCTOR X164
So what we do is just test your liver enzymes now and then in six weeks or so again to see if they've gone up um while you're on the medications.  Most people are completely fine.  Sometimes people need to stop it and then there are other things um that don't work quite as well as the statins that's why we start with them first but um, yeah most people tolerate it really well.  Uh any fevers or chills or chest pains?

PATIENT X164
No.

DOCTOR X164
Your last colonoscopy was in 2000 okay.  You're due for another colonoscopy.

PATIENT X164
Now when I took the barium, what was that for?  Is that just a dye or something?  Cause they sent me something in the mail that I had to drink or something when I had a CT scan.

DOCTOR X164
Uh yeah that was for the um CT scan.

PATIENT X164
That's not a colonoscopy?

DOCTOR X164
No.  

PATIENT X164
Oh.

DOCTOR X164
The colonoscopy is a camera study with a camera on kind of like a hose.

PATIENT X164
Right.

DOCTOR X164
And that they, you know we kind of explained this before.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
But the, so the barium there was the contrast for the CT scan.

PATIENT X164
Oh.

DOCTOR X164
So you swallow it and it glows on the scan.

PATIENT X164
Oh okay, yeah you drink that terrible stuff.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah I'm sure it's good.  But the prep for the colonoscopy is not much better um.  I've never had one myself but I've heard it doesn't taste as bad as the barium but it cleans you out.  @@@.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
They want you to be clean um.  Yeah I'm trying to think of what other things could be causing the pain.  You know you could have like a small tear inside.  Sometimes in people if they're constipated or their stools are hard, some are actually hard enough to tear the lining.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
And that causes pain and that can be sort of heal slowly over months.  Sometimes it just tears and if that happens it needs a repair @@@.  Um @@@ antibiotics to prevent infection @@@.

PATIENT X164
No like 90% there's no pain but when there is, I can feel it.

DOCTOR X164
It's possible that you did get a, like you did get a small tear or something um and it just heals slowly.  But it did show you had polyps in the past.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
You’re due for a colonoscopy regardless.  Um and then because of the um pancreas, you know it could be absolutely nothing but I would follow up on this just to rule it out.  Um you know it's an incidental finding but.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
But understand if it were something that you haven't found it before, since it's nothing traumatic or anything.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
@@@.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
So more than likely it's nothing but um it's something that we would advise for right now.  Um, this is the only other thing from the last visit, how are things going otherwise?

PATIENT X164
Pretty good.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  Um were you able to find any work since the last time?

PATIENT X164
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR X164
Have you found any work since the last time?

PATIENT X164
No.

DOCTOR X164
No, we all got to find work this month.

PATIENT X164
We're unemployed.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah.

PATIENT X164
I'm looking so.

DOCTOR X164
Well that's good.  Um any difficulty sleeping at night?

PATIENT X164
Every once in a while I have trouble getting to sleep but normally I just get myself tired so I just.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah.  Okay good.  Um so we'll check the statin today and I'll put in the request for the colonoscopy.  For the colonoscopy they make you do some more blood work.  They test your electrolytes and that sort of thing.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
Um your iron studies and stuff like that.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
So you'll be getting blood drawn beforehand so.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
And then just doing the prep @@@.

PATIENT X164
And that is going to be sent to me again probably?

DOCTOR X164
I'll put in for it and they should call you with a date to make an appointment um.  You don't take aspirin.  You should probably be on a daily aspirin uh I wouldn't start it before the procedure.  Do you take aspirin too?

PATIENT X164
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X164
Okay so don't start it now.  They'll want you to stop it five days before the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X164
But I should be taking aspirin?

DOCTOR X164
Yeah I think so um.  Yeah they found that it's just for heart health it decreases the risks of stroke and heart attacks.

PATIENT X164
Hmm.

DOCTOR X164
So it's 81 mg daily, just the tiny baby size.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
Uh they think that it decreases the risk of forming blood clots and things like that and people seem to tolerate it pretty well.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
It looks like you're probably taking @@@.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
The baby aspirin and then the colonoscopy and CT scan.

PATIENT X164
Okay.  So I got to get another CT scan?

DOCTOR X164
Yeah just of the pancreas.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
@@@.

PATIENT X164
Right.

DOCTOR X164
@@@.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
With more details.  Alright can I get a quick listen to you?

PATIENT X164
Okay.  Should I sit over here?

DOCTOR X164
Yeah.  Um.

PATIENT X164
Do I have to uh pick up anything today or will it be mailed to me?

DOCTOR X164
We can have you pick up the Lipitor today, the simvastatin.  Otherwise we can mail it to you.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
Do you want us to mail it to you?

PATIENT X164
Yeah if you don't mind.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah sure.

PATIENT X164
I don't really care.  How about blood work today, do I have to do it today?

DOCTOR X164
You don't have to do it today, just before you get the colonoscopy.  I put the order in the lab and you can go in and get it.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
It'll just be a standing order.

PATIENT X164
Alright.

DOCTOR X164
If they don't see the blood work when they get the consult.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
They'll reject it.

PATIENT X164
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X164
So get your lab, can you come in Monday or Tuesday?

PATIENT X164
Of this week?

DOCTOR X164
This coming week yeah?

PATIENT X164
Oh.

DOCTOR X164
You know what we can do instead is I'll order the blood work.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
And then you get it whenever you want to and then I'll put in the order for the colonoscopy after we've received the blood work.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
Then they don't reject it.

PATIENT X164
Right, right.  That'd be better.

DOCTOR X164
Okay, I'll do that.  Take a couple of deep breaths.  @@@.  Okay.  Couple of deep breaths.  Okay.  You can breathe normally while I listen to your heart.  Okay.  Can you lie back for me please?  Any pain up here?  It hurt?

PATIENT X164
Oh it hurts right in here.

DOCTOR X164
Do you ever get heartburn or reflux-type symptoms?

PATIENT X164
Yeah I've had them before too.

DOCTOR X164
Just right in the middle?

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
Have you ever tried omeprazole or any other kind of heartburn medications?

PATIENT X164
Oh no not really.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  Right here in the middle?  A little bit more?

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
A little more, here?

PATIENT X164
Right around in here so, you know.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  How much alcohol do you drink?

PATIENT X164
Hmm hardly any.

DOCTOR X164
You can sit up.  Um alright.  So one of the things it could be is uh acid reflux um.  

PATIENT X164
I do have a history of that.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah.  Do you want to try some medication for it?  We could do two weeks and see if it calms it down.

PATIENT X164
Hmm.

DOCTOR X164
Either that or try avoiding spicy foods and that kind of thing.

PATIENT X164
Yeah maybe I should just try avoiding foods.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  Whichever you decide to do, if it's still bothering you next time then uh you we could always think about trying something.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
Do you get it lying down?

PATIENT X164
Sometimes I have it laying down yeah.

DOCTOR X164
Is it worse after meals?

PATIENT X164
Right after meals but then it goes away.

DOCTOR X164
Does it wake you up at night?

PATIENT X164
It used to.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  But it's been okay recently?

PATIENT X164
Been okay recently.

DOCTOR X164
Alright.  We could take it slow um.  There's a couple of over-the-counter things that work pretty well.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
Um you know the Prevacid.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
Um that's the same medication we give here it's just a weaker dose, you can get like a two week course and sometimes when people get.

PATIENT X164
Yeah I used to get samples of those.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah.  @@@.  I don't have any samples at the VA um but uh we could get you @@@.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
Uh let me just run this stuff by my attending and uh I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
Any questions?

PATIENT X164
Um not at the moment.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:38  DOCTOR IN:  49:05

PATIENT X164
(Knock on door)  Hello.

DOCTOR X164
Okay so, we'll start the simvastatin um and then we'll get you a colonoscopy.  I think the last time you were here you got @@@.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
@@@ white blood cells.  When you get your labs can you get another urine test to see we can catch anything @@@?

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
Okay so that's good.  We'll send you the medication called simvastatin.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
Um so we'll have you do the labs and you'll get a call about the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
And the CT, I'll put in and they should call you to get you that appointment.

PATIENT X164
Okay.  And the phone number, do you have my home phone?  PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah.

PATIENT X164
A better number is my cell phone.  I can give that to you.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  Do you, I can't um edit this.

PATIENT X164
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X164
You can give it to them at the front desk and ask them to put it in for me when you sign out.

PATIENT X164
Oh yeah sure, I can do that.

DOCTOR X164
I'd like to see you back probably three months.  If there's anything pressing.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
I'll call you before that and we'll get you in sooner.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
But otherwise we'll see what the lab shows.  So you're doing the labs in the next week.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
And then we'll repeat your liver enzymes and check that.  

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
And repeat this to see if the so um.  I'm sure they'll call you on the CT scan and the colonoscopy.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
You can go to the lab any day to get your labs drawn.  Um sooner rather than later, if you can get them next week that'd be great then we can get the colonoscopy in a week or two and then recheck labs again.

PATIENT X164
Okay.  So some time next week I just come in for those?

DOCTOR X164
Yeah just go to the Lab downstairs, @@@.

PATIENT X164
Right.  So I don't have to have an appointment for that?

DOCTOR X164
Nope, just come in.

PATIENT X164
And they know what.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah it'll be in the computer so you give them your name and everything will pop up.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
So we've got labs um oh and uh @@@.  Should be one pill a day.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
So that's something they give it at night.  They actually found that the body makes more cholesterol while you sleep so take it before bed.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
@@@.

PATIENT X164
Hmm.  Okay.  So let's say I do it basically, just come in any time and get the blood work done.  Now when I get the CT test done they're going to do some more blood work right on the day or whatever.

DOCTOR X164
Uh.

PATIENT X164
Or do I have to.  I won't have to take any kind of dye for this time or?

DOCTOR X164
To do this contrasting again?

PATIENT X164
The CT.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah they probably have to.

PATIENT X164
Do they have to do the dye again?

DOCTOR X164
I don't think they use any dye for the bowel, you know the drinking dye.

PATIENT X164
Yeah.

DOCTOR X164
They'll probably give you the IV dye.

PATIENT X164
Oh yeah well that's no problem.  The other wasn't a problem either but.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah it depends.  If you're not looking directly at the uh intestines, it shouldn't have to be the oral dye.

PATIENT X164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X164
But I'm not 100% sure okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X164
And then the colonoscopy is something different.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah the whole clean out of the intestines.

PATIENT X164
Right.

DOCTOR X164
And so get the labs next week and then they should call to schedule the colonoscopy and the CT scan.

PATIENT X164
Okay.

DOCTOR X164
And show up and do your labs.

PATIENT X164
Alright.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.

PATIENT X164
So um I'll update the phone number because you might not be able to get through on the landline.

DOCTOR X164
Yeah give them your cell.

PATIENT X164

DOCTOR X164
You'll be here anyway; I said something in your note so.

PATIENT X164
Cause when you call me because.

DOCTOR X164
Yes.

PATIENT X164
Sometimes the phone just goes out and huh you might get a busy signal.

DOCTOR X164
Sure.

PATIENT X164
So my cell phone is PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR X164
Uh-huh.  Okay.

PATIENT X164
I'll be able to answer that.

DOCTOR X164
And then @@@ bowel cleanse.  Do you follow with Mental Health here?

PATIENT X164
Uh yes.

DOCTOR X164
Okay.  So do they do the.

PATIENT X164

PATIENT X499
Yep.

DOCTOR X499
@@@ huh.

PATIENT X499
Yeah still there.

DOCTOR X499
Yeah.  Let's see, what can I do for you today?

PATIENT X499
Hey, you know I got a blood clot right there and it's actually been @@@ since I got that @@@ knee replaced.  

DOCTOR X499
Okay.  @@@ think so yeah.

PATIENT X499
Or whatever, it's tender, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X499
Okay.

PATIENT X499
And then it stays in my leg and like it feels like I can pull my skin back and pull water down @@@.

DOCTOR X499
Okay.

PATIENT X499
Okay and I have like a tingling sensation in my leg and my back, everything's on my left side and then they did a MRI and then they never told me anything else about my prostate when they found a spot on it.

DOCTOR X499
Oh it looks like you're seeing the prostate doctors right?

PATIENT X499
Right.

DOCTOR X499
And uh yeah I think that was your kidney that they found the spot on, not the prostate.

PATIENT X499
Oh the kidney.

DOCTOR X499
Right so I think they didn't really think much of it, kind of reading their notes.  They just wanted to follow you.

PATIENT X499
They told me my prostate was swelled and there was a spot on my prostate.

DOCTOR X499
No they said.

PATIENT X499
A lesion.

DOCTOR X499
In your prostate?

PATIENT X499
Yeah.

DOCTOR X499
They said there was a lesion on your kidney.  

PATIENT X499
Oh my kidney, oh okay.

DOCTOR X499
But the thing is is that it's gonna be hard for us to, it looks like.  Have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT X499
Yeah.

DOCTOR X499
Cause it looks like you haven't refilled it since December.

PATIENT X499
That's because I had a lot.

DOCTOR X499
Okay.

PATIENT X499
You know I had a lot.

DOCTOR X499
Okay.  Yeah it's gonna be hard for us to like treat the @@@ of your pain you know if you're not really taking your blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT X499
I thought they said today its like 133 or 136, yeah.

DOCTOR X499
Uh let me see exactly what it is.

PATIENT X499
Yeah but I'm taking you know.  I just like had a bunch of it.

DOCTOR X499
So it looks like.  Okay.

PATIENT X499
When I came in I just had a stock pile at home.

DOCTOR X499
Okay.  Uh it looks like uh let's see we did this, you had an x-ray done of like your hip and your knee.  It looks like you got arthritis um, let's see.  Well you know for the pain you're having in your leg and your back you know we could probably do physical therapy cause we haven't sent you to Physical Therapy.  Um.

PATIENT X499
You know I'm doing a lot of exercising myself so I don't even know if physical therapy would work.

DOCTOR X499
You know otherwise there's not, I mean I could send you to see the orthopedic surgeons to see if they'd like to operate on you but other than that there's not a whole lot we can do for arthritis.

PATIENT X499
Okay so that, actually everything I'm having in my leg that's due to arthritis?

DOCTOR X499
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X499
Okay what's, you know the other day I was watching this program on PAD.

DOCTOR X499
Hmm.

PATIENT X499
Okay and from what they were describing on TV it's the same symptoms that I have on my left leg.

DOCTOR X499
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X499
You know uh.

DOCTOR X499
What symptoms are those?

PATIENT X499
Uh poor circulation you know.

DOCTOR X499
Well it's just poor circulation isn't a symptom.  Like symptoms are like pain and tenderness and tingling.  Poor circulation.

PATIENT X499
See I have that tingling and you know like I said the tingling it's like someone is @@@ apart.

DOCTOR X499
Yeah.

PATIENT X499
Like cold water on the inside and it's like it's draining and running down the inside of my leg.

DOCTOR X499
Well why don't you have a seat, let's take a look at it, how about that.

PATIENT X499
And like I said this here on my left side, they said kidney because you know almost everything is on my left side.  Right you know I have the soreness, stuff all on my left side.

DOCTOR X499

DOCTOR X499

DOCTOR X499
Yeah sure, sure, we could have you see the dermatologist for that one.  Alright, Dermatology, I'll refill your medicine uh what's, uh we need some labs on you today.  We need to check your hepatitis levels.  You're due for a cholesterol check.

PATIENT X499
Hey you know sometime.  Also you know when I was in the Marine Corps.

DOCTOR X499
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X499
And they were giving a shot, they used the same needle.  You know what I'm saying, cause it was a gun like we stood in line and somebody with a gun and shh shh shh.  Is it possible I got hepatitis that way?

DOCTOR X499
Hmm it's pretty unlikely.  Hepatitis C, the one you had that's mostly likely from either uh intravenous drug use or uh like a sexual encounter.

PATIENT X499
Okay.

DOCTOR X499
Yeah just getting like immunizations.

PATIENT X499
Oh.

PATIENT X499
Cause as a matter of fact the last time I went to the doctor was for my prostate.

DOCTOR X499
For gross hematuria, @@@, MRI, you had the MRI they didn't really see that much.  So it seems like they uh, so it just seems like they want to follow you for it.  They don't think it's much.  They think it might be a cyst on your kidney but.

PATIENT X499
Check on, you know the last time I went over there and @@@ doctor told me that my prostate was swelled right.

DOCTOR X499
Hmm.

PATIENT X499

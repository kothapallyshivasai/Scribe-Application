PATIENT X406
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X406
Cause I know they want you on the boot but it's too hard to put on like you say you're not going to use it okay.

PATIENT X406
Yeah well the boot, I can't put it on by myself.

DOCTOR X406
Exactly, exactly so you know if you're not gonna do that what are the other options okay.  @@@ need to look at @@@ shoes or we'll see what else we have okay.  Did they say if there was anything else when you saw them at that time?

PATIENT X406

DOCTOR X406
Cause I think you told them that you couldn't put it on @@@ right?

PATIENT X406
Right.

DOCTOR X406
Right okay.  

PATIENT X406
@@@ when they made those boots.

DOCTOR X406
Yeah right.  It should be something that makes it easier for you to put on and what not.  Let me take a listen to you.  Any cough or fevers, nothing like that right?

PATIENT X406
No.

DOCTOR X406
Okay.  Nice deep breath for me, in and out.  Good.  Breathe normal.  @@@.  The swelling is a little better than the last time when I saw you.

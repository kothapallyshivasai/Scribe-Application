DOCTOR X104

DOCTOR X104
Was it like on the, was the stool brown in color or black in color?

PATIENT X104

DOCTOR X104
Brown okay. And it didn't like turn the toilet bowl red or anything like that, it was just a little bit?

PATIENT X104
It was just the water a little bit.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  Alright and the dizziness, does it feel like the room is spinning for you?

PATIENT X104
Yeah.  And I just got glasses, not even a year ago.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
And they got them changed and I feel like whoa, I don't know.

DOCTOR X104
You're not really associated the glasses with anything.

PATIENT X104
No, no.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  But it feels like almost like you have to hold on to the @@@ spinning around and around.

PATIENT X104
Yeah, especially when I walk.

DOCTOR X104
So does it feel like everything when you stand up drains out of your head?

PATIENT X104
Yeah right.  You're standing there and every thing’s like whoa.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.

PATIENT X104
Whoa.

DOCTOR X104
Just to kind of you define and be sure, it's kind of more @@@ that like when you get up things kind of drain out of your head it feels like rather than sitting there and then feeling like the room's unstable and like spinning around.

PATIENT X104
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X104
Is that correct, it's more of the first one than the second one?

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  Alright.  Do you notice it like when you go from sitting to standing at all?

PATIENT X104
Just sometimes when I'm standing.

DOCTOR X104
Sometimes when standing.

PATIENT X104
Yeah like when I was waiting for the bus to come over here.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
I was standing there and I just felt like I had to hold on to something cause I felt dizzy.

DOCTOR X104

DOCTOR X104

PATIENT X104

DOCTOR X104

PATIENT X104
I don't know.  I go to bed, cause I'm tired and then I'm laying there and I can't sleep.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
And then @@@ one night, told you about getting that pain in my stomach.

DOCTOR X104
Okay, now tell me a little more about that pain.  It's in your lower abdomen?

PATIENT X104
It's right up through here.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.

PATIENT X104
See right here.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.  Is it in one area or does it radiate like up into your, higher?

PATIENT X104
Yeah it goes into my back.

DOCTOR X104
Goes around back.

PATIENT X104
Yeah and into my legs too.

DOCTOR X104
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X104
Back and legs.  Like somebody grabbed me, like something going in there and grabbing.  It's not really that bad.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
But the times that it, it's sort of like somebody's just grabbed me and they just like squeezed.

DOCTOR X104
Is that associated at all with food?  Like is it better when you eat or worse when you eat?

PATIENT X104
Probably uh, I don't know.  When I eat it doesn't bother me really.  It's just when I am doing nothing, I got walking today.  I walk two to three miles a day and I come back and I'm okay and then I sit down for a little bit and then all of a sudden I started getting that.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.

PATIENT X104
Like right now, it's starting to bother me, go right through like somebody just grabbed me.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  Alright.  Are you having any pain going down into like your scrotum at all?

PATIENT X104
No, there's nothing down there.  It's in the legs.

DOCTOR X104
Is it in the front part of the leg?

PATIENT X104
Yeah it's on both sides.

DOCTOR X104
Both sides.

PATIENT X104
Yeah both sides and in my back.  

DOCTOR X104
And it is the left side of the back?

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
You notice any changes in your urine at all?

PATIENT X104
The usual leg.

DOCTOR X104
Painful?

PATIENT X104
No, yeah it was burning oh about a week ago.

DOCTOR X104
Right.

PATIENT X104
Because I went to the bathroom and it was kind of burning and I know it wasn't because of alcohol because I don't drink no more so it's uh you know like.

DOCTOR X104
Any blood in the urine at all?

PATIENT X104
No I didn't see none.  Right now oh my God this thing hurts.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.

PATIENT X104
I thought maybe I was getting that diverticulitis again.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.  Is that what it feels like?

PATIENT X104
Yeah because that's how it started out the last time I came into the hospital.  Because I came into the hospital in October of last year.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
I thought it was my pancreas again cause I had fallen off the wagon but well I hadn't been drinking that much.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
It was just a few and then the doctor sent me home, said you're okay.

DOCTOR X104
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X104
And then I came back the very following day.

DOCTOR X104
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X104
And they had me drinking I guess that stuff and they took a test and they found out I had that diverticulitis.

DOCTOR X104
Uh okay.

PATIENT X104
I couldn't believe the doctor sent me home.  I was in pain.  I said why am I going home if I'm in pain?

DOCTOR X104
Okay.

PATIENT X104
And then I came back, when I came back in then that's when they diagnosed that and they fixed it @@@.  I said no man I ain't drinking no more, doing nothing.  I been eating healthy, except once in a while I'll eat a burger here and there other than that you know.

DOCTOR X104
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X104
Everybody likes burgers and I'm not unusual.

DOCTOR X104
Alright.

PATIENT X104
But uh I eat a lot of salads.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.  Okay.  I'm taking a look back; it looks like your blood counts have been a little bit low or were a little bit low during that hospitalization.  They've been pretty low in the past too.

PATIENT X104
Right.  

DOCTOR X104
Normally @@@ it might be due to the alcohol so I think probably number one we could check and see if that's still the case.  If you're still having low sugar or low blood counts okay.

PATIENT X104
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X104
Um, number two we'll take a look and see what we think about um the other pains.  So why don't you hop up over here and let me take a look and a listen okay.

PATIENT X104
See.

DOCTOR X104
A little dizzy just doing that?

PATIENT X104
Yeah doing that.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  Sounds like you have a @@@.

PATIENT X104
Right.

DOCTOR X104
Deep breath.  Just breathe normally.  Can I get you to lay back on the table?  

PATIENT X104
Oh man that hurts.

DOCTOR X104
Can I get you to untuck your shirt?

PATIENT X104
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X104
Let's press, uh let me take a look @@@ okay.

PATIENT X104
@@@.

DOCTOR X104
What's that?

PATIENT X104
It's a little tender right up in there.

DOCTOR X104
Alright, a little pressure over here, okay.

PATIENT X104
Oh I don't like that.  Yeah oh right there, oh my God yeah right there.

DOCTOR X104
It's mostly down here?

PATIENT X104
Yeah right.  

DOCTOR X104
Alright.  @@@.  I'll check your blood pressure.  A couple different ways, with you lying down and with you standing up okay.

PATIENT X104
Okay.  Do you think it could be a reoccurrence of that shit?

DOCTOR X104
Of the diverticulitis?

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
It could be, definitely could be.  I want to check some blood tests to help me see if that's what's going on.

PATIENT X104
Oh.

DOCTOR X104
You haven't been having any fevers so it's kind @@@ he guessed it but.

PATIENT X104
I told him it was my fault @@@.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
Usually I don't complain.

DOCTOR X104
No it's alright.

PATIENT X104
It's like man right now it's like I can feel it in the ribs @@@.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  I'm going to take a listen to your @@@ too okay.  Take a deep breath in and hold it.  Good.  Turn to the left side.  Again take a deep breath in and hold it.  

PATIENT X104
Wow.

DOCTOR X104
@@@.  Okay.  Are you okay?

PATIENT X104
My back.

DOCTOR X104
Okay go ahead and sit up for me.  @@@.

PATIENT X104
No.  It's just like the pain I've been having.

DOCTOR X104
I'm gonna look in your mouth, open up for me.

PATIENT X104
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X104
Say ah.

PATIENT X104
Ah.  I gotta go and see the doctor for the teeth @@@ and I can't afford it.

DOCTOR X104
Couldn't afford it.

PATIENT X104
They wanted like $350 and I'm not working so if I spent @@@.  Wow.

DOCTOR X104
I'm going to hold your arm and just hold still okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X104
I urinate a lot.

DOCTOR X104
@@@.

PATIENT X104
Yeah a lot, a lot.  Good thing I took one of those bottles home with me from the last time I went to the hospital.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
I sleep on the second floor and the bathroom is downstairs.  I just use that and I've been urinating a lot too.  And its one thing I don't even have to drink anything.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
Does diabetes do this?

DOCTOR X104
Yeah diabetes can do it if it's uncontrolled but your blood sugars look like you've been doing okay.

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
Um, I think we probably just need to check a couple blood tests today to see if we can figure out what's going on.  Check your blood counts and a set of electrolytes, including liver levels and check your pancreas.  I don't think that's what going on but I think we should probably just check how it's doing since you've had problems with it in the past.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Um I would tell you you're talking about the area it's concerning for diverticulitis, like that's what we normally think about you having pain but without any fevers, chills or sweats.  You on exam @@@ pain doesn't feel like diverticular pain.

PATIENT X104
Hmm.

DOCTOR X104
I think probably what we're talking about and I do want to check your urine as well, make sure you don't have a urinary tract infection.

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
And maybe a little infection in your kidney back there.  Um so we'll do all that stuff today.

PATIENT X104
Alright.

DOCTOR X104
Um and then follow that up um before you get out of here so we know what's going on okay.  Um.

PATIENT X104
Alright good.

DOCTOR X104
Alright.  Let me see if there's anything else we need @@@. 

PATIENT X104
@@@.

DOCTOR X104
What's that?

PATIENT X104
Reorder the medicine for the diabetes.

DOCTOR X104
Uh I'll reorder it yeah.

PATIENT X104
Cause I only got enough for I think four days, two pills.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.  So right now uh you're taking lisinopril and metformin only?

PATIENT X104
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X104
On a daily basis.

PATIENT X104
Right.

DOCTOR X104
You been taking half a tablet of metformin?

PATIENT X104
Right, it's like 1000 mg I think.

DOCTOR X104
@@@ so half would be like 500.

PATIENT X104
Right.

DOCTOR X104
But it's locked up on me right now for a second.

PATIENT X104
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X104
Now are you taking an aspirin every day?

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
Alright good. 

PATIENT X104
81 I think.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah one a day of baby, excellent.  Um okay.  And you know we definitely need to figure out.  I think the dizziness that you're having is probably related to whatever is going on in your stomach okay.  Um uh we can probably, let's see your blood pressure today was 108/67.  I still want you to take that low dose of the lisinopril 20 mg.

PATIENT X104
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X104
Um but I want you to make sure you're drinking enough water uh and doing things like that okay.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Um I think probably if there is anything, infection or whatever going down in your belly though, that's going to explain the dizziness that you've been having.  Um @@@ check list today.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
And see if there's anything like that going on.  So I put in this @@@ diabetes medication and then we'll get some blood draws.  @@@ not then I'll have you go downstairs and do it and then I'll call you as soon as I get the results.

PATIENT X104
Oh okay.  @@@ I just don't want to go back in the hospital again.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah I know I hear you.

PATIENT X104
But it feels good to not drink anymore.

DOCTOR X104
Does it?

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah I think that's a great health move for you.

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
And you're really going to reap the benefits of that okay.

PATIENT X104
Oh I feel a lot better with that now so.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
No I see all these people that are out there drunk and that used to be me.

DOCTOR X104
Used to be you.

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
@@@.

PATIENT X104
Acting stupid and I'm like oh okay.

DOCTOR X104
Alright.  Alright you need to hold on for one second.  If the guy is out here to do blood tests, I'll have you come out with me and get those done here but if he's not, just wait there okay.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT X104
Alright.

DOCTOR X104
Good to see you again.

PATIENT X104
Yeah.  And when do you want me to come back again?

DOCTOR X104
Uh we'll get you to come back and depending on what we find will be one issue and then otherwise we'll make sure we're keeping a close eye on you and make sure every thing’s pretty stable, probably like three or four months.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
And then.

PATIENT X104
Yeah cause last time I was supposed to see you you cancelled out on me.

DOCTOR X104
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X104
That was way before I went into the hospital again then.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah.

PATIENT X104
Then they kept on asking me well who's your doctor, primary doctor and I said DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X104
And then they go, then finally.  Then I got cancelled out last month and they rescheduled me for today.

DOCTOR X104
Yep exactly.  So I was happy I saw your name pop back up on the list today.  

PATIENT X104
Yeah.

DOCTOR X104
Definitely.  

PATIENT X104
Yeah you never know, I'm doing a lot better.  How is DOCTOR doing?

DOCTOR X104
He's doing good.  He's one of our chief residents now.

PATIENT X104
Really.

DOCTOR X104
Yep, yep.  He's doing real well.

PATIENT X104
You tell him I @@@.

DOCTOR X104
I will.

PATIENT X104
Tell him no more drinking.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X104
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  155:2  DOCTOR IN:  163:0)

DOCTOR X104
Alright, um I'm going to have you go downstairs and get those blood tests.  Go home after they're done, if there's anything abnormal with them, uh my biggest concern is a very mild case of diverticulitis.

PATIENT X104
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X104
Which we'll just give you a prescription, take it home.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Um the other things I'm thinking maybe you have like a kidney stone, maybe there's a urinary tract infection, those types of things we can also treat as an outpatient.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Now if things get worse, you start to get fevers, your pain gets worse, you have any falls or anything, come back into the hospital to the Emergency Department.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Um but make sure you're taking, I know your dry out, make sure you're taking enough fluids.

PATIENT X104
Alright.

DOCTOR X104
Your blood pressure did go down when I had you standing up but not to the point where I need to give you any IV fluids.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Just have a bottle of water around.

PATIENT X104
I'm taking a lot of magnesium.  I'll get some water again.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X104
I have to use the bathroom; you need to take my urine?

DOCTOR X104
Um go downstairs and then you'll need to go.

PATIENT X104
Oh okay then I'll just wait till you tell me.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah just wait exactly okay.

PATIENT X104
And another thing you ordered for me right?

DOCTOR X104
I'm not going to order any of the medicines just yet.  I ordered the metformin for you.

PATIENT X104
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X104
Yeah I ordered that and then we'll see if I need to give you any antibiotic.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Okay.  Alright um, any questions?

PATIENT X104
No.  Doc thanks a lot.  

DOCTOR X104
Good to see you again.  I'm glad to hear you're doing well.

PATIENT X104
Well @@@ cause I want to keep myself together.

DOCTOR X104
We'll do three months labs today okay.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Alright, good to see you.

PATIENT X104
I have to make a stop.

DOCTOR X104
Just drop it off, there's probably going to be nobody there up front but just drop it on the desk up front.

PATIENT X104
And then where do I go downstairs and?

DOCTOR X104
Uh downstairs there's uh, you take those elevators and to the uh lobby and take a left.  Take the elevator to the front lobby, go down to the first floor, after you get there come out of the elevator and take a right and then it will be the first hallway on the right.

PATIENT X104
Okay.

DOCTOR X104
Go down to the end of that and that's the Lab.

PATIENT X104
And they got me on the system?

DOCTOR X104

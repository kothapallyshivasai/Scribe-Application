DOCTOR X408
La, la, la.  Come on man you know, there's nothing to be nervous about.

PATIENT X408
I know that but, you know something I'm @@@.

DOCTOR X408
We're not here @@@.

PATIENT X408
All this time I'm being cuffed.

DOCTOR X408
It's alright.  I get nervous doing the same thing you know.

PATIENT X408
But I don't change this cause I don't if its arthritis or whatever it is man this stuff really didn't do me.

DOCTOR X408
Have you been going to Physical Therapy?

PATIENT X408
No because I don't have money anymore to be getting down here all the time like that.

DOCTOR X408
Let me honest the arthritis, there's very little.

PATIENT X408
I know y'all done told me, yeah I know it.

DOCTOR X408
That we can do but the thing that I would try to see is in my, you've seen them before.

PATIENT X408
Right.

DOCTOR X408
Okay good.  Have they taught you exercises?  

PATIENT X408
Yeah I do those exercises.  That was for my arms but uh now you know it's in my back.

DOCTOR X408
Okay.

PATIENT X408
And I don't sleep well at night no more cause I'm you know aching and you know I turn over and woke up and I woke @@@.

DOCTOR X408
So this is the thing that uh okay.  So I know your shoulders have been giving you a lot of problems.

PATIENT X408
Right.  That's, it's still.  You know I ain't got no strength over my head.

DOCTOR X408
Yeah.

PATIENT X408
It keeps locking up.

DOCTOR X408
If you want to consider surgery okay.

PATIENT X408
Uh.  You talking about cutting on my back?

DOCTOR X408
Not your back, your shoulder okay.

PATIENT X408
Well we got to talk about that @@@.

DOCTOR X408
That's a lot, that's fine and that's pushing it.  So I'm saying.  If you it's getting so bad that you can't do your regular daily @@@.

PATIENT X408
It's like shooting yeah.

DOCTOR X408
Yeah so then I want to @@@ about it, it's an option.  It's a crappy option but it's the only of the running okay.  But @@@.

PATIENT X408
Okay.

DOCTOR X408
@@@.  So to let you know what they would do is they would, you know take a look at your shoulder to see how bad it is.  They might have to replace some bone, if it's something mechanical and then after that surgery you would have to go to physical therapy anyway to have them check.  You'd have to @@@ off of the Coumadin but after that your problem is solved.

PATIENT X408
Does it hurt when you go off the stuff man?  @@@ you know, @@@.

DOCTOR X408
Okay the only other thing.  I'm going to be honest so you know we're giving you pain medications, but physical therapy when you can do it and then the only other thing is your weight you know.

PATIENT X408
Lose weight.

DOCTOR X408
Weight loss yeah.  @@@ you weigh.

PATIENT X408
213.

DOCTOR X408
213 is not @@@ weight before.

PATIENT X408
Yeah I know I've gained weight.

DOCTOR X408
Okay.  All that stuff.

PATIENT X408
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X408
And I mean, it's kind of you're your own worst enemy in that sense you know.

PATIENT X408
What eating too much?

DOCTOR X408
Yeah because think about, okay, so think about your back @@@ okay.

PATIENT X408
Right.

DOCTOR X408
And in August when I saw you, you weighed 194.

PATIENT X408
Right.

DOCTOR X408
Now it's like you're carrying around a 20 pound bundle with you.

PATIENT X408
Yeah, all right here, I gotcha.

DOCTOR X408
So it's a lot of stress.

PATIENT X408
But I mean, look I been having, man I been, you know I been @@@.  I don't know, you know if it start happening.  I'm always hungry.

DOCTOR X408
Well you get fuller; I mean you've got to choose.  There's different ways right.  I'm not telling you how to eat but just eat the right things.

PATIENT X408
That's right yeah.

DOCTOR X408
You know, instead of fried foods, no fried foods @@@.  Instead of going and reaching for a snack like a cookie or something, get an apple, just the right thing.  All that stuff makes a difference.

PATIENT X408
Right, right.

DOCTOR X408
And you know of course you know try to stay as active as you can you know.  I know that it's hard with the arthritis but walking and when you do exercise it actually helps.  That's why we send you to Physical Therapy.

PATIENT X408
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR X408
But the thing is, I don't think that hope is lost because we just need to get you to start doing these things you know that'll help you.

PATIENT X408
Okay I'll start walking outside and might do a little better.  If I feel a lot better, I then might do it @@@.  @@@ oh you know.

DOCTOR X408
@@@.

PATIENT X408
I've been you know drinking a lot too doctor.  Like uh @@@.  You know @@@ kind of scare me cause I ain't used to this.

DOCTOR X408
How are your moods, like are you feeling a little bit down?  

PATIENT X408
Uh yeah because I want to be down on myself.  You know I ain't been doing, uh I get up for a morning walk or @@@.  I'm @@@ if I did a bad job so you know I get my mind @@@ that all it is.  

DOCTOR X408
So you live with your daughter right now?

PATIENT X408
Yeah I do.

DOCTOR X408
So that @@@ response, some old common @@@ alright is @@@ exercise right.

PATIENT X408
Oh really @@@.

DOCTOR X408
Cause when you start getting down like the mind starts not focusing okay.  It's just one of those things that @@@ helping you to focus and causing you, you're in the middle of something and all of a sudden you forget what you're doing.

PATIENT X408
That's it, that's it.

DOCTOR X408
Right.  Um.

PATIENT X408
@@@ you know except she be at work and I'm home by myself, that be the one time she at work but she'll call you know.  @@@ microwave too.

So what we need to do is kind of make a plan and @@@ your goals you know for the next time I see you okay.  You know we'll make a list.

DOCTOR X388
PATIENT.  How you doing?

PATIENT X388
Fine, fine.

DOCTOR X388
How have you been doing?

PATIENT X388
Oh fair to midland we'll say.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.  That's good.  That's always the question.

PATIENT X388
Each day gets a little slower.

DOCTOR X388
Does it?

PATIENT X388
Yes it does.

DOCTOR X388
Were you waiting for Halloween?

PATIENT X388
Uh no, just answer the door.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
With the kids.

DOCTOR X388
Well that'll be fun.

PATIENT X388
A lot of the children out the east coast are sad.

DOCTOR X388
I know.

PATIENT X388
What a disaster holy cow.

DOCTOR X388
I know.

PATIENT X388
That's horrible.

DOCTOR X388
Seriously.

PATIENT X388
Horrible.

DOCTOR X388
So what's new?

PATIENT X388
Well since I've last seen you I've had carpal tunnel done on my hands again.

DOCTOR X388
You have okay. 

PATIENT X388
Uh-huh.  That's still uh.

DOCTOR X388
Feeling better?

PATIENT X388
No but that's standard.  But I've had it done three times in each hand.

DOCTOR X388
I know.

PATIENT X388
And this time they had to open my hands up and they said this is the last time to do it.  I own my age and the size of my hands.

DOCTOR X388
Anything else new?

PATIENT X388
Oh just once in the summer I was a little dizzy with the heat but that was at.

DOCTOR X388
Did you get, did you have to go to the hospital?

PATIENT X388
Uh yes I did.  I went and had a stress test and everything, my heart doctor.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
And they checked it out and that was about it and I've had a sleep test.

DOCTOR X388
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X388
And I guess I'm gonna go see a sleep doctor.  Whatever, what do they call it again?

DOCTOR X388
Sleep apnea?

PATIENT X388
Sleep apnea yes and one of the heart doctors thought that might be a part of my heart.  I have a little bleep in my heart all the time and so that's what they said to do that.

DOCTOR X388
To do what?

PATIENT X388
Have a sleep test.

DOCTOR X388
Did you have the sleep test already?

PATIENT X388
Yes I've had that done.

DOCTOR X388
And it says that you have sleep apnea?

PATIENT X388
Well no I haven't met with the man that read the test yet.

DOCTOR X388
Oh, gotcha.

PATIENT X388
That's within a week or two I go meet with him.

DOCTOR X388
Gotcha.

PATIENT X388
But the one heart doctor, a different doctor that reads some of the things he says take the magnesium and I've been taking magnesium and it helps.

DOCTOR X388
For what?

PATIENT X388
You need it in your system, it helps you.  So now I feel a lot better.

DOCTOR X388
Okay.  What is it?

PATIENT X388
But the heat was the big problem.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
This summer was horrible.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
But other than that I'm fine.  My arthritis is killing me but otherwise what are you gonna do.

DOCTOR X388
Are you taking anything for it?

PATIENT X388
Just the meloxicam is for the arthritis.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.  Oh right I forgot you have to take that.

PATIENT X388
Oh yes I take all my medications.

DOCTOR X388
Does it help?

PATIENT X388
I hope so.

DOCTOR X388
Okay.

PATIENT X388
I mean nothings gonna do, make it that perfect anymore.

DOCTOR X388
And you have another outside primary care doctor is that right?

PATIENT X388
Uh I have my family doctor; it's been 40 years DOCTOR in Villa Park.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X388
And then a heart doctor which is DOCTOR in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X388
And he's the one that gave you the magnesium?

PATIENT X388
That's a lady.  Pardon?

DOCTOR X388
She @@@ the magnesium, is she the one that gave you the magnesium?

PATIENT X388
Uh it was another one of the heart doctors that she referred to.

DOCTOR X388
Okay.

PATIENT X388
Cause he read, he looked into why I got the beep in my heart.  They all know that.  I've had it for years.  Everything thinks like, when they take my blood pressure or something or whatever it is when they listen to my heart they always probably get a little beep, a little jump or something.

DOCTOR X388
Huh.

PATIENT X388
See so but, but I've had that for years and years and years.

DOCTOR X388
But no new chest pain or anything like that?

PATIENT X388
No, none of that no.  There was one thing I asked last time.

DOCTOR X388
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X388
And doggone it again, why can't we get montelukast.  That's for my asthma?  I can't get a 90 day fill on it.  It's only 30 day fill so that's 12 times a year I gotta keep calling for that one thing.  That's a lot of postage and then we damn waste it.

DOCTOR X388
Did I order it?

PATIENT X388
Yeah everything is 90 days.

DOCTOR X388
I changed it.

PATIENT X388
I know you did but it still comes 30.

DOCTOR X388
I don't know why.

PATIENT X388
It comes in one bottle.

DOCTOR X388
I've changed it again.

PATIENT X388
Yeah it comes and the last time, the last one I ran low and I called in and it says oh it's over with and it wasn't over with.

DOCTOR X388
Huh.  Hmm.  I'm sorry about that.  I keep changing it on my end and I already had changed it.

PATIENT X388
Well it only comes in, they send me the exact bottle and it comes that way with only 30 tablets in it.

DOCTOR X388
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X388
Like you know so it's a sealed bottle.  But I get most of the medications in larger quantities just write them down.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.  And your stress test this summer was negative?

PATIENT X388
Yeah everything was fine.  Yeah oh yeah.  I've had all of that.

DOCTOR X388
And you got your labs done today.

PATIENT X388
Yeah.  You got any report on that yet?

DOCTOR X388
There well your CBC looks fine.

PATIENT X388
How about the cholesterol I tried.

DOCTOR X388
That's still pending so.

PATIENT X388
Oh cause I fight with that.  Oh I don't fight; I try to keep it real low.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
The heart doctors want it low and I've been doing it.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
But I'm very faithful with all of my medications.  I take them exact like I'm supposed to.

DOCTOR X388
I believe you.  Well your blood pressure looks good.

PATIENT X388
Uh-huh.  I still go three days a week to the hospital and exercise.

DOCTOR X388
Good.

PATIENT X388
xxx xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X388
Good.

PATIENT X388
Cardiac rehab I've been doing that for 12 years now.  It's a @@@ task but I still do it.  And we open up the hospital at 6:30 in the morning so I got to get up at 5:30 to do that.

DOCTOR X388
Take a seat up here @@@ let me take a quick look at you.

PATIENT X388
Alright.  You'll probably hear the little beep.  Oh then another thing that the sleep test is, my heart gets real slow sometimes when I sleep.

DOCTOR X388
Does it?

PATIENT X388
It drops real low yes.

DOCTOR X388
Like how low?

PATIENT X388
Uh 38, I think once the heartbeat was 38.

DOCTOR X388
Big deep breaths for me.  

PATIENT X388
And these, at the hospital every time we used a machine or anything.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
We used one of these cleaning things and I store them in my pocket and I haven't had a cold now in four or five years.

DOCTOR X388
Oh really.

PATIENT X388
Yes.

DOCTOR X388
That's better than I've done.

PATIENT X388
Oh I've been lucky and I wash my hands 100 times a day and I use that what's you're doing there.

DOCTOR X388
Good.

PATIENT X388
Yeah.  No swelling of the legs or feet or anything.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.  Well that's good.

PATIENT X388
The only thing is I just bruise a lot more now in my older age.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
A lot more bruising but other than that.  But.

DOCTOR X388
Are you still using the Albuterol a couple times a week?

PATIENT X388
The albuterol I, not really, yeah maybe once or twice a day maybe.

DOCTOR X388
Once or twice a day?

PATIENT X388
Yes.  And when I was in the hospital for that check-up, they take that away from you and I says well they gave me, this is what I used to have years ago.  This was from hospital and this has both.  This is kind of like a preventive and a helper.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
It was a double but albuterol is just for emergency.  What was the other one?  Albuterol and I forget the name of the other one.  I used to have a double but then they had these years back.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah.

PATIENT X388
And this is what the hospital gave me for the day I was in there.  They won't let you bring your own.

DOCTOR X388
Really oh.

PATIENT X388
Oh yeah when you go in there right.

DOCTOR X388
Yeah I could see that.

PATIENT X388
You can't bring your own medications.

DOCTOR X388
That's true.  Let me go talk to the other doctors I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X388
Okay.

DOCTOR X388

PATIENT X388

PATIENT X388

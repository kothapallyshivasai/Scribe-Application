DOCTOR X534
Okay.  Why is that?

PATIENT X534
I don't want to gain weight.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  So breakfast isn't the right one to cut out.  

PATIENT X534
Why's that.

DOCTOR X534
Try cut down on something else because breakfast actually kick starts your metabolism.

PATIENT X534

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  How so?

PATIENT X534
I didn't like, I try to vacuum the floor.  I can't basic stuff like the vacuum.  Man I have to sit down after I do that.  I have to go back and lay down.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Stuff like that I can't and I been having trouble breathing lately.

DOCTOR X534
When?

PATIENT X534
When it got real hot man, that stuff.  The air was on, it just felt like it didn't work or these pumps that I'd been taking felt like it didn't work and I'd catch myself not breathing.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
I could be watching TV.

DOCTOR X534
And right now you're taking the Advair?

PATIENT X534
Right.

DOCTOR X534
You take it twice a day?

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
And then you have the albuterol that you just take as needed.

PATIENT X534
That's stuff bad and that pump, I think that pump needs to be upgraded.

DOCTOR X534
The albuterol?

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  It only comes in one strength uh when are you, like when are you noticing the shortness of breath?

PATIENT X534
Well I notice it about 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.

DOCTOR X534
Okay you get short of breath.

PATIENT X534
I have to get up, it's like I stop breathing and I got to get up and grab that pump.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
You know.

DOCTOR X534
Do you feel very anxious when this is going on?

PATIENT X534
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Alright um and you get, have you ever been on any other medications for your asthma?  Um.

PATIENT X534
Uh basically no.

DOCTOR X534
No, anything like Spiriva or tiotropium. 

PATIENT X534
No.

DOCTOR X534
Never heard that?  

PATIENT X534
Never heard of those.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  Um and do you take anything for allergies?

PATIENT X534

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  Have you ever taken Singulair?

PATIENT X534
Singulair?  No.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Not that I remember.

DOCTOR X534
Have you noticed any change in your ability to concentrate on things?

PATIENT X534
Uh concentration, concentration like what, like watching TV or.

DOCTOR X534
Like if you're reading something or trying to pay your bills or anything like that?

PATIENT X534
Oh yeah, yeah I can't concentrate on that at all, no.

DOCTOR X534
Alright.  Have you noticed it feels like you're moving more slowly?

PATIENT X534
Uh in the arm.

DOCTOR X534
In the arm?

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
How so?

PATIENT X534
Maybe I couldn't even move this one up the other day.  I forget to move it up like this and it will start hurting.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Then I have to grab it and the muscle pushes back down.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Same thing with this arm and this rash, I don't know what, it just happened.  I don't know what that is.

DOCTOR X534
@@@.

PATIENT X534
This came out of nowhere man.

DOCTOR X534
What are you talking about?  

PATIENT X534
What is that?

DOCTOR X534
Oh this right here?

PATIENT X534
Yeah.  

DOCTOR X534
It looks like just dry skin to me.  Does it itch?


PATIENT X534
No.  I've never itched it.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  Um this to me um seems like the summertime okay.

PATIENT X534
I don't know.

DOCTOR X534
I would just put some lotion on it.  Let me see your other elbow.

PATIENT X534
This is not like that.

DOCTOR X534
This one's not as bad um.  I would start with some lotion or like uh, do you use Vaseline or anything?

PATIENT X534
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Yeah start with that and if it gets worse um I want to see you but right now it looks okay.

PATIENT X534
You know I have never been tested for diabetes or cancer here.

DOCTOR X534
Or cancer so uh.

PATIENT X534
I've never been tested.

DOCTOR X534
Right so we'll get to that.  Um do you have any feelings of hurting yourself?

PATIENT X534
Uh not hurting myself but hurting other people sometimes.

DOCTOR X534
When is that?

PATIENT X534
Oh that's been happening this week, I mean this year.

DOCTOR X534
Alright.

PATIENT X534
I get frustrated man, I get frustrated.  I'm not visiting good with other people.  They're like @@@.  My fuse is very short.

DOCTOR X534
Alright.  Um so a couple of things going on here.  First off uh you sound depressed to me okay.  You sound very depressed.  You have, we have uh kind of an eight point screening test for depression um and usually you're positive on 2-3 of them um that's when we consider someone to be likely depressed um.  You're currently positive on six of them so you know it sounds like you're dealing with some depression right now.  Can you think of any reason you would be depressed?

PATIENT X534
Well my mother and father, they was in the hospital not too long ago and I been dealing with that, I don't know.  I know and so were all my other brothers.  They have families and I was dealing with this by myself.

DOCTOR X534
Uh-huh.  Do either of your parents live with you?

PATIENT X534
They, both of them does.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Yeah both of them are sick.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
One has Parkinson's and cancer and my mother's sick.  She has depression.  She gets bouts of depression.

DOCTOR X534
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X534
She's taking Xanax, Zoloft and all this stuff and it's making me that way too man.  I know I can't deal with it all, I don't know what to do.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  I can definitely understand your frustration with that situation.  It sounds like you've got quite a bit on your plate right now.

PATIENT X534
Right, right.

DOCTOR X534
Uh the other thing that you mentioned, the black stools.

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Um so when people have black stools the thing we would be concerned about is that you're possibly bleeding somewhere in your GI tract.

PATIENT X534
@@@.

DOCTOR X534
Now if uh, if it resolved then you're probably not bleeding anymore.

PATIENT X534
No.

DOCTOR X534
Uh and it doesn't, just because they were black doesn't mean that you were bleeding um.  The other thing that can sometimes make your stool black is Pepto Bismol if you take the medication.  If you're taking Pepto Bismol it'll also be black or iron supplements but I don't think you're taking that.

PATIENT X534
The only thing I did, I took some of my mother's omeprazole.

DOCTOR X534
Omeprazole?

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  I thought you were already on omeprazole?

PATIENT X534
I run out of it the other day.

DOCTOR X534
Okay so first off we can refill that for sure um but no, omeprazole shouldn't make your stool black.

PATIENT X534
Right.

DOCTOR X534
Uh.

PATIENT X534
That was what the pain I was having all day, around the chest heart area, through the stomach area, a pain, just pain that come out of nowhere.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  Uh if you're having pain in your chest, you know you may want to consider going to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT X534
That's what the lady told me already.

DOCTOR X534
Right but you didn't go to the Emergency Room?

PATIENT X534
I have two elderly people to uh.

DOCTOR X534
Right, alright.

PATIENT X534
Take care of.

DOCTOR X534
I can understand that um.  The main concern though is if you have a heart attack you know it doesn't matter who you have to take care of cause you're not gonna be there anymore.  Well the other that you bring up is uh screening tests for cancer and diabetes um.  You are correct; uh you know I don't think we've ever screened you for diabetes um. Previously there really wasn't any indication for you to be screened for diabetes.  You know you weren't that heavy and you seemed like you were doing well um.  In light of your recent weight gain um you know sometimes that can be related.  I would like to screen you for diabetes um.  The other thing we need to check is your lipids, your cholesterol needs to be rechecked um because we haven't checked them in a while.  Um and then as far as cancer screening uh there's only really two cancers that we screen for, um, because when you screen cancer it has to be common to pick anything up and it has to be deadly.

PATIENT X534
Oh.

DOCTOR X534
So things that we're concerned about are prostate cancer and colon cancer.

PATIENT X534
Okay colon cancer.

DOCTOR X534
Colon cancer, you had the colonoscopy so you'll be and you did um some polyps on there, um.  It was done in 2009 so you'll need a repeat in 2014.

PATIENT X534
Right.

DOCTOR X534
You might need one five years after that because of the polyps.

PATIENT X534
So what happens with the repeat?

DOCTOR X534
When you have polyps?

PATIENT X534
I had two of them that were pre-cancer they told me.

DOCTOR X534
Right.  So the uh your polyps, there's much different kinds of polyps um.  Your polyps were the less scary kind so they very infrequently turn into cancer.

PATIENT X534
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X534
So we want you to, normally people get screened every ten years.  You had polyps so they want to screen you every five.

PATIENT X534
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X534
Uh polyps take a while to turn into cancer.  It's not like you're gonna get one today and a month from now it's gonna be cancer.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
So if there were only two then, screening you again in five years there may be more polyps but it's unlikely that there would be an actual cancer.

PATIENT X534
Oh.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Alright.

DOCTOR X534
Um the other thing, prostate cancer um.  Prostate cancer is very common but it's usually not very deadly.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
Um do you have difficulty urinating?

PATIENT X534
No, I have good flow.

DOCTOR X534
Now can you sleep through the night without getting up to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT X534
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  So in someone who doesn't have any symptoms and do you have a family history of prostate cancer?

PATIENT X534
Uh my father had testicular cancer.

DOCTOR X534
Testicular cancer?

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  Uh when did your dad develop testicular cancer?

PATIENT X534
Oo uh two years ago.  Uh he's cancer free as they say right now.

DOCTOR X534
Excellent, excellent.  Do you know how to check yourself for testicular cancer?

PATIENT X534
No.

DOCTOR X534
Okay all you need to do is feel your testicles and if you feel any hard bumps that's what we'd be concerned about.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
So a bump like a pea, if it felt like a pea and it'll be hard.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
That's when you would want to see someone.

PATIENT X534
Oh.

DOCTOR X534
Uh if you're not having any symptoms and you're not, there's no family history of prostate cancer um the screening test that we have sometimes cause as much problems as they do good because if the screening test is positive then we're gonna want to do a biopsy.  Um biopsies can cause erectile dysfunction.

PATIENT X534
Oh.

DOCTOR X534
Incontinence, so my recommendation would be that you don't get screened.

PATIENT X534
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  If you want to be screened that's fine but uh I don't think it's a good idea.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Alright.

DOCTOR X534
Alright.  We have a lot of things to address today.  Um I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR.  Do you have more questions?

PATIENT X534
No just the medicines.  The omeprazole.

DOCTOR X534
Yeah.

PATIENT X534
@@@.

DOCTOR X534
You have all the stuff you need refilled.

PATIENT X534
So I can pick it up @@@ today.

DOCTOR X534
Sure.  Okay.

PATIENT X534
Alright.

DOCTOR X534
Let me go talk to DOCTOR, I'll be right back.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:36  DOCTOR IN:  48:20)

DOCTOR X534
Alright.  So let's go online and get these things taken care of.

PATIENT X534
Alright.

DOCTOR X534
So first off um based on the symptoms that you're having um you meet the criteria for what's called a major depressive episode.  Um there's a reason, you have an inciting incident that would explain why you're depressed.  You know you have a lot going on with your parents right now um but it's affecting you quite a bit from what you're telling me.

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
So I would recommend treating you um with a medication.  Um it's one of the medications in the class called uh selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and what that means is it increases the amount of serotonin in your brain and serotonin is a chemical that makes us feel better.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
Um so along the studies have shown that um compared to just giving medication or just having people talk to a therapist the best method is to do both.  You get the best results when you take medication and you talk to someone.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
Is that something you would be open to?

PATIENT X534
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR X534
Okay so then you know I think the best thing would be to start a medication and to have you see um a therapist.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
Um the other thing is in the few weeks right after you start one of these medications, sometimes you're gonna take them 3-4 weeks before you get the full effect of the medication.

PATIENT X534
Right.

DOCTOR X534
In the first few weeks sometimes people have increased feelings of suicide so if that's something that you notice to be happening to you then you would want to uh probably talk, go find some help, go to the ER or something because you know that's obviously very serious okay.

PATIENT X534
Right.

DOCTOR X534
Alright.  Um second, I can refill all of your medications.  Do you know which ones you need refills on?

PATIENT X534
Omeprazole.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Uh hydrochlorothiazide.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Uh wow, all that's run it on the screen.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Cause basically all of them.

DOCTOR X534
Do you pick them up here or do you get them?

PATIENT X534
I can pick them up here today.

DOCTOR X534
Okay so I'll make sure that you have refills on everything and you can pick them up at the window.

PATIENT X534
That’s a lot of them.

DOCTOR X534
Yeah I got them all in my note from the last time I saw you.  So you take the Docusate to help, it's a stool softener.

PATIENT X534
I don't need those.

DOCTOR X534
You don't need that okay um but the Advair, it's the inhaler.

PATIENT X534
Yeah I take it, I want to take it already but instead of 12, see that's the problem.  Some of those are about to expire anyway.

DOCTOR X534
So the ones that are about to expire I can add refills onto them.

PATIENT X534
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR X534
Would you rather have those delivered to your house or pick them up here?

PATIENT X534
I can pick some up today.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  Um and then the hydrochlorothiazide you said you need.

PATIENT X534
Yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Are you taking any of the stool softeners like the Lactulose or the hemorrhoid suppository?

PATIENT X534
I'm taking the poly um.

DOCTOR X534
The polyethylene glycol?

PATIENT X534
The big white bottle.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
Yeah, yeah I'm taking that.  That helps, man that lactose stuff, is that?

DOCTOR X534
Lactulose okay.

PATIENT X534
@@@.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.

PATIENT X534
That big white one I take that one and that makes me use the washroom.

DOCTOR X534
The metoprolol, that's the other blood pressure one.

PATIENT X534
Metoprolol yeah I take that.

DOCTOR X534
Okay, do you need more of that?

PATIENT X534
Yeah I'm running out of that too.

DOCTOR X534
Alright and then simvastatin, the one for your cholesterol.

PATIENT X534
Oh yeah I take that.

DOCTOR X534
Okay and then you said you need more of the omeprazole.

PATIENT X534
Asmanex I've run out completely, omeprazole I've run out completely.

DOCTOR X534
Alright so we'll get those all refilled for you.  

PATIENT X534
What else, omeprazole, Asmanex, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol.  That's about it yeah.

DOCTOR X534
Okay.  I'll get them all refilled uh.

PATIENT X534
So which ones can I pick up over there?

DOCTOR X534
Which ones did you need to pick, I mean I can make it so you can pick them all up over there.

PATIENT X534
Okay.  I'll pick them all up today.

DOCTOR X534
Okay, alright.

PATIENT X534
I don't have nothing to do.

DOCTOR X534
We can do that.  Um and then uh I want to add another medication for your asthma.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534
Call tiotropium or Spiriva.

PATIENT X534
Right.

DOCTOR X534
Uh you know if you're still having a lot of symptoms.

PATIENT X534
That's when I have the wheezing, I take them here to here.

DOCTOR X534
Okay and this will be uh you know you have the asthma medications that you take every day; this will be one of those.  The albuterol is the only asthma medication that you take when you actually have symptoms.

PATIENT X534
Right.

DOCTOR X534
All the other ones are controller medications that you'll take every day and matter what.

PATIENT X534
Oh.

DOCTOR X534
And that's what this one will be too.

PATIENT X534
Okay.

DOCTOR X534

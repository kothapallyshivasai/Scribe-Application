DOCTOR X531

PATIENT X531
@@@ up pretty high.  It's just the swelling @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Right here PATIENT.

PATIENT X531
Okay.  Thanks.

DOCTOR X531
Alright.

PATIENT X531
It's hot in here.

DOCTOR X531
Let's see.

PATIENT X531
Alright you even got me under 140s a couple of times.

SECOND PERSON 
Yeah that looks okay.

PATIENT X531
We're doing good.  

SECOND PERSON X531
But we were at Dermatology.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah but I'm working on it.  I know the last time it was @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Um so.

PATIENT J239
Yeah we saw you come in late too today.
DOCTOR X531
Yeah don't tell anybody else.

SECOND PERSON X531
Don't tell anybody else.

PATIENT X531
I don't squeal.

DOCTOR X531
Alright so how have both of you done?

PATIENT X531
Good, still above ground.

DOCTOR X531
Good, good.  And you saw the dermatologist this morning?

PATIENT X531
Yeah, she shot me up.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah he @@@ there.

DOCTOR X531
Oh you know they froze all that stuff.  That's what they do, that's the whole treatment.

PATIENT X531
She had one of those fire knives, @@@.  I think she treated those @@@ spots on my arms from getting too much sun outside.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
He needs some medications.

DOCTOR X531
Oh @@@ refills, I've got it right here.

SECOND PERSON X531
Metolazone and magnesium oxide that I know of.

DOCTOR X531
Looks like niacin, is he taking that?

SECOND PERSON X531
No he's not taking the niacin.

PATIENT X531
What's that?

SECOND PERSON X531
The niacin that uh uh the doctor, who told us to take the niacin?

PATIENT X531
I have no idea.

SECOND PERSON X531
Did you tell us to take the niacin?

DOCTOR X531
I might have, yes, yeah it was me.  You didn't like that?

SECOND PERSON X531
No it's that we talked to the cardiologist and he said uh he didn't think it was necessary, let's just try the fish oil a little longer.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
And see how it works.

PATIENT X531
And the fish oil I still take.

DOCTOR X531
Oh he does.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

PATIENT X531
And what's that other pill I'm cutting twice too?
SECOND PERSON X531
The hydralazine.

PATIENT X531
That's the orange pill.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah, it's the hydralazine.  That's the blood pressure, is that for blood pressure?

DOCTOR X531
Yep.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh that's the water pill?

DOCTOR X531
Not hydralazine um.

SECOND PERSON X531
That's the one he takes, supposed to take three times a day.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
He took that to twice a day cause he was getting dizzy.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.  When did you see the cardiologist?  Was this at an outside cardiologist?

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.  @@@ the niacin is fine.  Just for the.

SECOND PERSON X531
That's @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Uh your cholesterol is a little bit high.  Higher than the more risk that there's gonna be.  That's what we believe.  At 83 we don't know if that would be the best you know, we need our goals to be. 

PATIENT X531
@@@.

DOCTOR X531
Oh you @@@ what we use is the literature that averages people out.  People that they study are between 40 and 60 usually.  So we don't know if we need to be as aggressive with somebody after they're 80.  I mean the risks of having drug interactions like you've already had with other medicines.

PATIENT X531
Hmm.

DOCTOR X531
Um goes up so.  How aggressive do we need to be uh but we also don't want to have problems.

PATIENT X531
I had that other medication and that didn't work.

SECOND PERSON X531
Well that's what he's talking about.

PATIENT X531
And I experienced that once.

DOCTOR X531
Hydralazine is a medicine that the way it works is that every eight hours; it's three times a day.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
If you don't take three times a day, it will be worn off before the next dose so that there's.  I mean I don't want to step on the cardiologist's toes.

SECOND PERSON X531
No, no, he didn't tell, he didn't tell us not to take it.  He just decided not to take it cause he was getting dizzy.

DOCTOR X531
Like he told you twice instead of three times?

SECOND PERSON X531
No he, he.
PATIENT X531
He told us three.

DOCTOR X531
Oh.

SECOND PERSON X531
It's three times a day the way he prescribed it and he didn't have anything to do with it.  We decided that maybe if he took it twice a day he wouldn't feel that uh lightheadedness.

PATIENT X531
Yes.

DOCTOR X531
Well I mean, did you bring in your blood pressure cuff though?  Did you have them synchronize it or no?

SECOND PERSON X531
I don't know.

DOCTOR X531
I mean did you bring it into the clinic today; did you bring it to the nurse?

SECOND PERSON X531
The what?

PATIENT X531
No.

SECOND PERSON X531
The blood sugars or the?

DOCTOR X531
Yeah, no the cuff.  Remember how we were having this problem.

SECOND PERSON X531
Oh.

DOCTOR X531
You're always high.

SECOND PERSON J239
That's right, you told us I just, I forgot.

DOCTOR X531
It's no big deal cause actually it looks good today.

PATIENT X531
What did you need from home?

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.  So what are you doing at home?  He wanted us to bring our machine to check it with the nurses.

PATIENT X531
Oh.

DOCTOR X531
Sorry, I mean it's not a huge deal but I know there was that discrepancy.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah, it was always high here.

DOCTOR X531
It was always high here and.

SECOND PERSON X531
It was normal at home.

DOCTOR X531
Always normal.

SECOND PERSON X531
Now I'll go with normal occasionally.

PATIENT X531
They have me going on @@@ breathing machine.

DOCTOR X531
Uh no today your blood pressure looked good.

SECOND PERSON X531
It should, yeah well he was more relaxed today I guess.

DOCTOR X531
Good, good.  Um okay so otherwise um other than these issues with the hydralazine what.

SECOND PERSON X531
You don't think he should take it twice a day, that's not a good idea?

DOCTOR X531
Oh, well yeah what I'm saying is if we need to change it to something else we can but I don't think that's the best way to go about it because I mean the reasons that we, the medicines are certain time periods is because that's how they work.  If it was the hydralazine I could probably give him something that was once a day.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
That would work 24 hours.  It's like some medicines are once a day, some are three times a day.  Not because the three times a day ones are stronger but because the once a day ones go on slow and off slow, and the three times a day one goes on fast and off fast and if you don't take them three times a day there's a risk that so in the middle of the day your blood pressure is.

SECOND PERSON X531
Gonna go up.

DOCTOR X531
200 and.

PATIENT X531
Well why were my sugars was off?

SECOND PERSON X531
Not your sugars your blood pressure.

PATIENT X531
Well I'm just saying.

SECOND PERSON X531
Blood pressure.

PATIENT X531
Sometimes it happens to me.  I put some @@@ stuff in the back of my neck.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah sugars are a little different.

PATIENT X531
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
What else could be causing him to get lightheaded and dizzy?

DOCTOR X531
So that's what we have to talk about.  When are you feeling this?

PATIENT X531
Mostly in the morning.

DOCTOR X531
And you're saying.  Uh so in the morning you start to feel dizzy and lightheaded.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
And is this when you open your eyes in bed or once you get up and get around?

PATIENT X531
When I get up and I start to move.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
Sometimes.

PATIENT X531
Maybe a little aggressive in the morning than at night but it catches up with me right away and I gotta go sit down.

SECOND PERSON X531
Is it before you take your medication or after?

PATIENT X531
Yeah it's before the medicine.

SECOND PERSON X531
Before you take your medicine.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

PATIENT X531
The Lantus.

DOCTOR X531
Okay and this is kind of new?  Starting to be worse, how would you say?

PATIENT X531
It just seems like certain, certain times.  Sometimes I'll go for maybe weeks nothing and then in one week, two or three days I'm in the morning I get up and by the time I come downstairs and start to move in the kitchen I get lightheaded and I gotta go sit in the chair.  Not for long but.

DOCTOR X531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X531
I can't walk; I can't continue to walk around.

DOCTOR X531
Okay. 

PATIENT X531
I feel weak.

DOCTOR X531
And do you feel like it's happening more often now?

PATIENT X531
Not really, no not really, just certain days I get up and I just can't function.  I want to do something and I say forget about it, I'm not doing it.  I want to do something outside and I say uh uh, can't do it, going back.

DOCTOR X531
Um and there's nothing that you can tell when it's gonna come on?

PATIENT X531
No.

DOCTOR X531
It's uh like before you take your meds, before you have any meals?

PATIENT X531
Before I have anything.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.  Do you feel like uh do you ever check your blood sugar at that time?

PATIENT X531
I check it in the morning.  Some days it's 140, some days it's higher.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

PATIENT X531
But if it's low I'm shaky, I'm shaking.

DOCTOR X531
Uh do you notice that the blood sugar is associated with this feeling of dizziness at all?  Is it higher when you feel dizzy?

PATIENT X531
No, no @@@ no.

DOCTOR X531
It's kind of independent of that.

PATIENT X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
Um.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
I thought it must be the blood pressure, not the blood sugar.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah exactly, that's the other thing uh.  When you say dizzy I know we said lightheaded already but do you feel like the room's spinning around you?  Or do you feel more like you're about to pass out?

PATIENT X531
I'm just weak.

DOCTOR X531
Weak.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Uh.

PATIENT X531
I feel like, I'm pretty @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
He's not steady on his feet.

DOCTOR X531
Uh-huh.  Any chest pain or palpitations?

PATIENT X531
No.

DOCTOR X531
Uh okay and you never had any episodes of actually passing out that you remember?

PATIENT X531
No.  Probably a year or so ago.

SECOND PERSON X531
Well you can't stop @@@.  But that was a sugar related thing yeah.  That was not.  Could the blood pressure medication have something to do with it?

DOCTOR X531
Yeah that's what I was trying to look at it.  It could be a couple different things.  It might, I know you feel bad and it's a bad feeling but it might be because of the medication that's not necessarily a bad side effect of the medication.  Um one of the medications, the one you take at night the atenolol.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
Have you always taken that at night?

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.  That may be one that we might want to switch you to the morning and get a different one for you uh because that medication, the atenolol it will work.  How it works is it prevents the heart from beating too fast and what, the good thing about that is that uh that way your heart, your blood pressure doesn't go up.  Your heart doesn’t go really fast and pumps the blood pressure way up.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Uh that's kind of one of the ways that that medicine works in multiple ways that we don't necessarily even understand but that's one of the ways it does that.

PATIENT X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
The problem is that if you want to do anything and exert yourself what the physiological, what the body does is it increases your heart rate so that your brain can get that, so your muscles can get all the blood, so your body wants the blood pressure up a little bit um.  If we give you this medication that doesn't allow your heart to speed up fast sometimes if you move around really quickly your body can't adjust to that.  Your heart can't adjust to that really fast so it makes you feel a little dizzy or lightheaded.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
And it can be to the point where you fall down.  That's when we say @@@.

PATIENT X531
I personally think it's just that I get up and I'm doing bend much too fast.

DOCTOR X531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X531
I'm @@@ and I'm not @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X531
And when that happens I just find a chair and then I go sit down.

DOCTOR X531
And another of the, on top of that, just um as we get older, we get into our 38s.  Um.

PATIENT X531
Waist bands huh.

DOCTOR X531
The vessels because less compliant before when you're young the vessels can open and close a little bit more and you can variations in how we move around and stuff can be, that can help with that and as we get older the vessels don't do that as much.

PATIENT X531
The function.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah they don't function fast enough so that they can't adjust when you get up really fast or you do a lot all at once.  Um I would say to start with um you're heart really looks fine so I don't think we're giving you too much of the atenolol.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
Um if it was down in the 50s or something I'd say we'll back off on that and see how you do um what I would say to start out is basically kind of lifestyle modification stuff.  Get up slower um, especially in the mornings.  A lot of people will actually get out of bed and go jump in the shower.  Kind of slow movements, get up, sit down on the side of the bed for a second and then stand up.  Um don't do it all at once, the same thing with anything, just sitting on the couch.  Uh be careful about standing up really fast or getting up to go to the door.

PATIENT X531
When I move yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah um because that can also precipitate kind of a feeling of dizziness.

PATIENT X531
I've done that for years.

DOCTOR X531
Oh.

PATIENT X531
I get up and I come down, I don't want to sit down long.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah then that's I would say if you're still feeling bad about that would be to switch this medication to the morning instead of late at night because what happens is you take this at night and your heart rate goes down anyway at night.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
And you also have this medication that's on, it's a 24 hour medication so it's working all day but um theoretically it can be a little stronger, it can be like the peak of it will be right in the morning.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
So that maybe what's happening is that your heart rate's already slow from just, from sleeping, you're body's response and then on top of that you have a medication that slows it down a little bit more.

PATIENT X531
Yeah more.

DOCTOR X531
And then when you get up you're having symptoms so, it's not bad that it's on at night and we have lots of people on it at night and in the morning, it doesn't matter as long as you take it the same time of day.  So if you wanted to move that one to the morning and move one of the other blood pressure medicines to nighttime, which I'd recommend the fosinopril that you have to nighttime.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
Um just so you have, I mean you're taking the same amount of medications.

PATIENT X531
Different times.

DOCTOR X531
But we might prevent this a little bit more and see if it doesn't help.

SECOND PERSON X531
But keep the hydralazine at three times a day?

DOCTOR X531
I would.  I would unless you notice at home the blood pressure is below 90 on the top number.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
Which that would be.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah, it's never been there no.

DOCTOR X531
Um cause that's when you start reaching symptoms.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah well it's never been there.

DOCTOR X531
Being less than 100 or less than 90 uh that's when we really start getting.

SECOND PERSON X531
No his blood pressure's usually about 145/67 and I don't know, is 125 is not too high for the age or?

DOCTOR X531
So again a lot of these things, we look at all these numbers in people when they're blood pressure is under 140 or even under 130 they do better in the long run.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
And @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
Um for you I don't know if we have to be that aggressive.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Especially if you're having other symptoms.  If we get aggressive about the blood pressure and you fall and hit your head, we didn't do you any favors you know.

SECOND PERSON X531
That's uh right.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.  So um I would say we can slowly work on it but um I'm not going to simply go in and throw you on a bunch of new medications.

PATIENT X531
Medications.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

PATIENT X531
Cause I got enough changes in @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
No it's just.

DOCTOR X531
And.

SECOND PERSON X531
What he's on now seems to be working fine.

DOCTOR X531
Good.

SECOND PERSON X531
Except that this lightheadedness.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
I didn't know but just adjusting sounds good.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
To switch those medications.

DOCTOR X531
If the blood pressure's starting to go up that's when we really want to do something.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
But um, if it's staying the same or even improving like it was today it was better than the last time.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
I would keep what we're doing on and not worry so much that.

PATIENT X531
Just slow down.

DOCTOR X531
In the 140s.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah just slow down.

SECOND PERSON X531
Don't try to move.  Don't try to move too fast.

DOCTOR X531
Um the metolazone that you're on, I couldn't find it for some reason, you just take them on Tuesdays and Thursdays right?

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
@@@.  You get all of these in the mail?

SECOND PERSON X531
Yes we do.

PATIENT X531
She's been doing @@@ prescriptions.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.  

PATIENT X531
I think we just called in last week.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah, there were no more prescriptions.

PATIENT X531
Right, which ones, @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Otherwise doing pretty good?

SECOND PERSON X531
He's got a scratch on his leg.  I don't know if his leg is infected or.

DOCTOR X531
I'll take a look.  What'd the dermatologist say?

SECOND PERSON X531
He didn't look at it.

DOCTOR X531
He didn't look at it.

SECOND PERSON X531
No.

DOCTOR X531
When did this happen?

SECOND PERSON X531
About I think last week.

PATIENT X531
Last week.

SECOND PERSON X531
Wednesday.

DOCTOR X531
So did you just scratch that.  Did you fall, you didn't fall?

PATIENT X531
Uh @@@ on the back.

SECOND PERSON X531
And we've been treating it with uh flushing it with saline water and putting an antibiotic on it.

DOCTOR X531
Just like a triple antibiotic?

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah, triple antibiotic but then I noticed it started to get red but it's not feverish.

DOCTOR X531
No.  Have you.

SECOND PERSON X531
Just like.

DOCTOR X531
Is it painful?

PATIENT X531
No.

SECOND PERSON X531
It's like cellulitis.

PATIENT X531
But as soon as I touch something I, I know I get an infection.

SECOND PERSON X531
He's prone to infection.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

PATIENT X531
It could be my sugar.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah um, if the sugars are up then infections are more likely but.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Your sugars haven't been that bad.  The other thing is with having, you've had diabetes for a while now right?

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
With diabetes you get um, @@@ um you get diseases in our arteries and veins and stuff and so what happens is that if there's not good blood flow there then none of the things that cause us to fight off infection are there.  That's not painful when I press?

PATIENT X531
Just a little bit, not much.  It's gotten better.  In fact it was.

DOCTOR X531
Did you have it there too?

PATIENT X531
Yeah it was up there too.

DOCTOR X531
I don't think it's infected but uh do you wear, do you have compression stockings or anything like that?

PATIENT X531
No.

SECOND PERSON X531
He has them but he doesn't wear them.  We @@@.

DOCTOR X531
It's not, it's not infected but um it's just kind of what we call hyperemic around there because it's gotten injured and because it's uh.

SECOND PERSON X531
It's gotten better huh?

DOCTOR X531
Yeah exactly.

SECOND PERSON X531
When he hit uh, when he hit the desk he was mad.

DOCTOR X531
You were mad?

SECOND PERSON X531
He was mad.  He was angry then.

PATIENT X531
When I @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Right, yes.  Let me listen to you.  Deep breaths in and out.  Just breathe normal.  Well it might help in the short term to get, to make sure that that blood keeps flowing through that area and it doesn't just stay there um to help.  If you notice this getting any more swollen or the redness starting rather than staying the same or getting better, if it starts to spread, especially going up that's when we start thinking about infection.  Let's just say you're more prone to infection so keep doing what you're doing.  Keep the um.

PATIENT X531
Antibiotic.

DOCTOR X531
Antibiotic.  Usually what I say is you can keep it open during the day if you need to get it some air or whatever but at night put it on and cover it.

PATIENT X531
Well I'm just putting cotton gauze.

DOCTOR X531
No that's fine.

PATIENT X531
I don't put any medication.

DOCTOR X531
Oh I mean that's all fine too.  To be honest with you the short antibiotic thing we do it because we think it helps but there's never been any research that's proven that it helps.

SECOND PERSON X531
Well you know the thing is when it was oozing.

DOCTOR X531
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X531
It was, it uh prevented from sticking to the gauze.

DOCTOR X531
The medicine was good for that.

SECOND PERSON X531
So that's why I used it.  Now it's drying up quite a bit.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
But then the redness started to and I see one of his ankles started to get all red, I said this is something.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah so.

SECOND PERSON X531
But it's not hot, it's not feverish.

DOCTOR X531
Right.  Those are all like if it's starts becoming more painful, if it starts to get swollen.  If the redness you think is getting worse, progressing, uh then you can either come in to Urgent Care Clinic or you can give this clinic a call and um they can call me and I'll call you back and they'll send you something out.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
Or do something.  I mean it's not; it's not going to need anything right now.

SECOND PERSON X531
It doesn't need an antibiotic?

DOCTOR X531
Not just yet cause it's not gonna help.

PATIENT X531
Could you send me that stuff like to wash?

SECOND PERSON X531
The saline, we can get that.

PATIENT X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
I'm not sure if we can.

SECOND PERSON X531
So the water.

DOCTOR X531
Just water.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah the saline.

DOCTOR X531
I can see if I can put it in.

SECOND PERSON X531
Saline solution.

PATIENT X531
Is that the paper?

DOCTOR X531
Oh you're allergic to silk.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah he's allergic to that too.

DOCTOR X531
The silk tape.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yep.  He's allergic that tape.  That one causes big problems.

DOCTOR X531
Then it would get more red.

SECOND PERSON X531
Then it would get more red.

PATIENT X531
When I had my appendix, my appendix healed and I was all covered with blisters and they found out it was the tape so now whenever, so they have to put paper over to keep from that.

DOCTOR X531
Uh the other thing it looks like were you gonna see the GI doctors?

SECOND PERSON X531
Well he was supposed to in May but we never got an appointment.

PATIENT X531
I went you to put in a prescription.  They told me last week, to re-examine my hearing you have to put in my prescription.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah Audiology so just so they redo the hearing test?

PATIENT X531
Yes cause she's thinking that I might be due for new hearing aids.

DOCTOR X531
What do you think, are you just ignoring her?

PATIENT X531
No.

SECOND PERSON X531
Maybe it ain't the hearing.

PATIENT X531
No, no, no.

SECOND PERSON X531
But see when we went there last year, late last year, she said you're not due till July of 2010 and you have to make an appointment through our primary doctor.

PATIENT X531
And I think you better put in the.

DOCTOR X531
And you've seen, you saw last year yeah before.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
For Audiology.

DOCTOR X531
GI.

SECOND PERSON X531
GI they never called us.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah and that's weird.  We'll schedule an appointment today, no problem.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Um let me make sure and when did you see them last?

PATIENT X531
I think a year ago.

SECOND PERSON X531
GI?  In 08.

DOCTOR X531
08.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

PATIENT X531
Been two years.

DOCTOR X531
Okay and if it's been over two years they want us to put in a new consult but in May.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah I think it was May 5th when we.

DOCTOR X531
So I'll just put in another one just so they know why.  There's a certain way to do things around here.  @@@.  Um anything else that you guys need for sure?

SECOND PERSON X531
No that's it.  We want to make sure the medications that are.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah I'll make sure your meds are all refilled before.

SECOND PERSON X531
Oh I don't think he needs any blood work.  He's had it not too long ago.  I think the last time he was here he had blood work done.

PATIENT X531
The only medications that bother me is when they put me in the hospital.

SECOND PERSON X531
But you're not ornery any more.

PATIENT X531
Fish oil is working fine, take the fish oil twice a day.

SECOND PERSON X531
But we don't know what it's doing to your cholesterol.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah I don't want to mix @@@.  

SECOND PERSON X531
So would it be helpful if we constricted that leg a little bit, like put a band on it?

DOCTOR X531
Probably would slow it down.  Sometimes what happens when the blood slows down in the leg it sometimes puts a force.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
And they find this infection, not infection, @@@ formation it can make it, we want everything to keep moving.

SECOND PERSON X531
To keep yeah.

DOCTOR X531
In that area.

SECOND PERSON X531
So keeping his leg up.

DOCTOR X531
Oh yeah, yeah, those are all good things um.  Let me see here.

SECOND PERSON X531
It's not too swollen.

PATIENT X531
Why are my legs this color though?  What causes that?  I mean it's uh.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah it's usually um the veins in there that aren't, that aren't working as good as they once did.

PATIENT X531
They're not pumping.

DOCTOR X531
Um and it's just what we call venous insufficiency.  The veins aren't, the veins all have little valves in them so that when you pump the blood up here and when it comes to the top it hits the valve and it pumps it and it's just that over time, especially if somebody's had diabetes or some sort of leg insult those valves don't work as good and they're not like.

PATIENT X531
They're not.

DOCTOR X531
They're not like heart valves.

PATIENT X531
The motor's not right.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah exactly.

SECOND PERSON X531
In the legs.

DOCTOR X531
It tends to stay down in the leg and that's when you get the swelling a little bit and then also it can become discolored a little bit.  That's why you also lost hair down there, @@@.

PATIENT X531
@@@ hairy legs.

DOCTOR X531
Alright.

PATIENT X531
I need hair up here too.

DOCTOR X531
Um around February we checked everything so probably what I would say is next time when you come in, before you come to the clinic, just stop by the Lab and we'll check your cholesterol again, it'll be actually in two months here.

SECOND PERSON X531
That would be uh fasting?

DOCTOR X531
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.  They'll want you to fast.
DOCTOR X531
That's true so it might be, anytime even for a morning appointment.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah for sure.

DOCTOR X531
Stop by the Lab.

PATIENT X531
If I get up in the morning and try to get my car to drive or something without eating @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Right.

PATIENT X531
I'm gonna have something, even if it.

SECOND PERSON X531
We might.

PATIENT X531
Just a slice of toast.

SECOND PERSON X531
When we go to the cardiologist, perhaps we could have that cholesterol checked through him which is easier for us to do early in the morning.

DOCTOR X531
Uh-huh.  Yeah that's fine if you bring it in as long as we have a record of it.  Um.

PATIENT X531
Something.

DOCTOR X531
That's not a big problem yeah I don't think there's anything else that we need to check.  Alright, anything I didn't talk about that you need me to go over?  Let me talk with my supervising doctor a few moments and we can get this show on the road.

SECOND PERSON X531
Anything else?

DOCTOR X531
Do you see an eye doctor or foot doctor?  Oh it looks like you saw the foot doctor in December.

SECOND PERSON X531
Foot doctor we see outside of the clinic and actually the eye doctor was recent but we're going to stop going here too.  We're gonna start going outside.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.  As long as anything that I mean.

SECOND PERSON X531
@@@.

DOCTOR X531
If you're telling me that is fine, I'm going to take your word for it but remember we're going to document what you say.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
And we have to say that currently.

PATIENT X531
Yes.

DOCTOR X531
So there are things we just have to check every year so, so that we get reimbursed or the clinic gets reimbursed.

SECOND PERSON X531
Right and let's see.

DOCTOR X531
Um, alright.  I'll be right back.

SECOND PERSON X531
Alright, thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  74:04  DOCTOR IN:  80:34)

DOCTOR X531
Alright it looks good.  One, the only thing that she was saying is that if you continue to have these symptoms, you're gonna, after @@@ these medications around from the nighttime to the daytime.  Uh we're gonna want to recheck an echo, that's the ultrasound of the heart just to make sure there's nothing new going on with the heart and it's causing you to feel this.  Generally it wouldn't be something that would only happen during the mornings if it were the heart but it'd be something that you'd notice throughout the day.  Um but that's like the next kind of step @@@ we okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
Um any other questions for me?

PATIENT X531
No.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.  

PATIENT X531
Everything seems to be okay, I'm still above ground.

DOCTOR X531
You're still above.

SECOND PERSON X531
So I just uh, give me some directions, I'll write down what we're supposed to do.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah, so what I would do.

SECOND PERSON X531
Change the.

DOCTOR X531
Just change as little as possible by switching.

SECOND PERSON X531
So write here.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah so um atenolol which is @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
To the a.m.

DOCTOR X531
To the a.m. and.

PATIENT X531
Is that the green one?

SECOND PERSON X531
No it's the little white one you take at night.

PATIENT X531
Oh.

DOCTOR X531
And uh.

SECOND PERSON X531
Take that in the.

PATIENT X531
Oh it looks like the water pill.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah, we're gonna put that in the morning @@@.  Then the half a pill.

DOCTOR X531
Right.

SECOND PERSON X531
You're gonna take at night.

PATIENT X531
The one you break?

SECOND PERSON X531
The one we break in half.

PATIENT X531
That goes at night.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah we're switching those around.

DOCTOR X531
Well yeah you'll still get good blood pressure control throughout the day.

SECOND PERSON X531
And then you take the orange pill three times a day again.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah no I would do that just until.  If you notice low blood pressures then we can change that around.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
And I'm thinking over the next couple visits, probably the next visit, we'll talk about switching the.  How much is that dose again.

SECOND PERSON X531
Hydralazine?  I think it's @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
Is it @@@.

DOCTOR X531
So maybe the next time, I mean I don't want to switch everything all at once.

SECOND PERSON X531
No.

DOCTOR X531
Cause it gets confusing.  So maybe the next time we can talk about taking that off and going up on some of the other stuff cause there's room to go on the fosinopril a half a tab.

SECOND PERSON X531
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X531
We can always go to a full tab.  So we can do that next time.

SECOND PERSON X531
Sometimes he gets little tremors, little shaky but I don't know if that has anything to do with any of the medications that he's taking it might just be his demeanor at the time you know he gets real angry and just.

PATIENT X531
Like yesterday.

DOCTOR X531
Uh yeah I don't know.  You're on a lot of different medications.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
But you know that um. @@@ on a lot of medications @@@.

PATIENT X531
First things @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Right, so let me know if that gets worse and we can start looking into stuff and we can start taking stuff off and putting stuff back on.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
And the goals of all this, I mean are obvious to get you on as few of pills as possible.  It's gonna take a little bit of time.  It's a lot easier to throw a bunch of pills.

SECOND PERSON X531
Oh sure.

PATIENT X531
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X531
Sure.

DOCTOR X531
Than take them off okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

DOCTOR X531
Alright so we'll see you back in like three to four months again and make sure that this has gotten better.

PATIENT X531
Make it four months.

DOCTOR X531
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
Well but in the meantime we should be hearing from Audiology and the GI Clinic.

DOCTOR X531
So take that up to the clerk at the front up here.

SECOND PERSON X531
Okay.

DOCTOR X531
And they'll try to schedule those appointments right now.

SECOND PERSON X531
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X531
Just so that we know you can get in okay.

SECOND PERSON X531
Alright.

PATIENT X531
We had some wind damage.

DOCTOR X531
When it was all crazy windy, last month.

PATIENT X531
It messed up our patio door.

SECOND PERSON X531
On the patio door.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

PATIENT X531
The adjuster came @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yesterday.

PATIENT X531
Got up on the roof, found a couple shingles loose, to make a long story short.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

PATIENT X531
We have a thousand deductible and it came to $950 to buy a new patio door.

SECOND PERSON X531
@@@.

PATIENT X531
And he said because it broke off we had to call this claim in and they'll readjust.

DOCTOR X531
Then.

PATIENT X531
I said to him you know I'm not a highly educated @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
You're smart.

PATIENT X531
@@@ taking a check and sending it @@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
You're not gonna get it.

PATIENT X531
@@@.  So we went shopping.  A heavier door costs lots of money, $3000 so I called him back and I said we got a line so he's gonna come to see us @@@.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah.

PATIENT X531
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah.

PATIENT X531
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X531
So he got a little aggravated yesterday.

PATIENT X531
And then I took it out on her.

SECOND PERSON X531
Yeah and we were leaving the house and coming out of the garage and our neighbor had pulled up and said I hear you two, she heard him yelling so loud.

PATIENT X531
We can tell you.  Thank you doc.

DOCTOR X531
Alright you have a nice trip.

SECOND PERSON X531
You have a nice day.  That's right we won't see you know.

DOCTOR X531
Yeah I was going to tell you that.

SECOND PERSON X531

DOCTOR X531

PATIENT X531

SECOND PERSON X531

So you never know what you're going to find when you open up the door.

DOCTOR X120
Let me carry that for you.

PATIENT X120
You know I didn't get the MRI.

DOCTOR X120
How come?

PATIENT X120
Because I'm claustrophobic.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.

PATIENT X120
And I brought the medicine back to the room.

DOCTOR X120
Did you try the @@@?

PATIENT X120
No I didn't take it cause I couldn't even get in there.  I had a cold now.  I've got a cold now and that's the biggest problem I have when I'm laying down, due to my back or it's the postnasal drip and it makes me gag.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.

PATIENT X120
And that's my nightmare yeah.  And I'm sorry but you know.

DOCTOR X120
No and so we'll do something.  We'll figure this out.

PATIENT X120
Okay.  I brought you back the pill too cause I didn't take it.  I don't know if they want it, so I probably should give it back to the pharmacy or.

DOCTOR X120
Um yeah I can do that.

PATIENT X120
Oh good, okay.  Yeah I bet they can use it.  I didn't even open it doc you know.

DOCTOR X120
@@@ okay.  But you got a cold @@@?

PATIENT X120
Yeah, yeah I've got a cold for a couple weeks now and um yeah.  You know cold sneezes so that and um my biggest problem lately is I uh fell out of bed twice in the last month and last night, night before last I fell out of the bed, a queen-sized bed and uh I sat up and my daughter's telling me that cause she is in the living room and I sat up and as soon as I sat up, I went right out of the bed in between the dresser and the night stand right.  @@@ you know.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
I plastered the arm real good and I bump my head on the dresser and I didn't pass out but I was soaking wet with sweat and the last time I had that happen to me, that's what woke me up because I was having a nightmare and I was holding my breath again and uh she went to shake me to wake me up and I jumped out of bed and fell right down again.  So I'm having that fall thing going on.

DOCTOR X120
How often are you waking up at night?

PATIENT X120
A lot.

DOCTOR X120
At nighttime?

PATIENT X120
Yes, the medicine I'm getting ain't helping me.  You know I had a real bad one you know.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
A couple real scary ones.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.

PATIENT X120
They don't scare me as much as they scare my wife and my daughter you know.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
Cause I look like kind of a mad man.  My daughter said you look like a mad man this morning you know.  My eyes are this big you know.  You know I'm embarrassed because she came in, she seen me with the diaper on and you know.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
She's 17 you know I.  We don't even tell the kids I put them on you know.

DOCTOR X120
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X120
But I had that on and that's been a real bummer too.  The wetting the bed and the constipation God I got some stuff, what do you call it, the enemas you know the liquid enemas that come in a squeeze bottle, she had to go out yesterday and get me that because I couldn't make it go and then that helped it like a great deal but then I'm bleeding.

DOCTOR X120
You're having bleeding?

PATIENT X120
My hemorrhoids.

DOCTOR X120
Oh okay.

PATIENT X120
I was bleeding like a dog and uh it was terrible so.  Yeah I think I'm taking so much medicines I just think that's adding to it.  But I am putting weight back on.  I go to my cardiac exercise and now I'm on the next 12 week thing.

DOCTOR X120
Well good.

PATIENT X120
I got my 70% from the VA on my pension.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
But they rated me 70% so I'm going to file the appeal and get the other 30 cause they said the only thing that they were lacking was being able to substantiate that I'm unemployable.  Well I'm on Social Security for being unemployable and disabled and I been telling the nurse that I'm unemployable by the psychiatrist DOCTOR and by another doctor here but they said they have to have more evidence so I don't know what evidence they need.

DOCTOR X120
When was the last time you saw DOCTOR?

PATIENT X120
Oh I seen him about two weeks ago I think.  I think I have to see him this week coming.

DOCTOR X120
Okay, okay.  Do you talk about @@@?

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
Do you see anyone on the outside at all?

PATIENT X120
No, really I mean.  He got me on this medication and you know, like I'll tell him I'm falling out of bed and he'll tell me well move the night stand and throw a couple comforters down on the floor next to your bed, don't do that.  So I ended up taking all the, it's insane.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
You know its insane man.  So the heart, @@@ is good.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
I @@@ neck and low back you know.  But uh that was tough because of the loss of weight you know.  Cause I've lost a lot of weight and I look like it too.

DOCTOR X120
You look better than when I saw you last.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
@@@.

PATIENT X120
Yeah I've done good now you know.  I'm starting to, you know put on the weight now.  I'm about 164, 165.

DOCTOR X120
Hmm.

PATIENT X120
But I'm working out so.  At the Cardiac Rehab.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
But I've just resigned myself about this waking up at night you know and wetting the bed and you know and not having any control over these nightmares you know.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.  They @@@.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.  

PATIENT X120
And I slowed down on drinking.  My wife tells me no you can't do that, you'll screw your kidneys up and.

DOCTOR X120
@@@ slow down drinking @@@.

PATIENT X120
Border yeah.

DOCTOR X120
@@@?

PATIENT X120
No, no, no. I had a couple drinks last month and I got uh some medicine from the psychiatrist to take if I feel like I'm going to start having a problem.  I can't think of the name of it now.  Uh, Antabuse.

DOCTOR X120
It's Antabuse yeah.

PATIENT X120
Yeah so.  But I was really depressed after a while.  My dad's funeral.

DOCTOR X120
Are you having neck pain?

PATIENT X120
Yeah I'm having some neck pain, back of my neck.  When I wake up in the mornings uh cause that's what I do is I try to sleep high.

DOCTOR X120
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X120
And @@@ I'm doing this at night and I wake up with a really pounding headache and uh I don't think it's anything to do with any damage from my body just the way that I sleep and uh that's about it.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.

PATIENT X120
Of course I'm making my wife crazy cause she's watching me now.  I went for the sleep apnea test.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
And the nurse told me I held my breath three times during the evening.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.

PATIENT X120
Well she said one of them was 40 seconds long.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
Then they woke me up about 10 to 5 on that one.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
And they tried to give me that little mask that you wear.

DOCTOR X120
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X120
I couldn't wear it.

DOCTOR X120
@@@.

PATIENT X120
Neither one.

DOCTOR X120
Oh.

PATIENT X120
So then they let me go home and she says DOCTOR called me and let me know about that.  I hadn't heard from DOCTOR.  Maybe she went on vacation or something.  xxx xxx doctor so.

DOCTOR X120
Okay.

PATIENT X120
Yeah so I don't know if we need a follow up on that.  @@@ thing is I even hold my breath during the day she notices.  I don't know what that's from.  Your guess is as good as mine.

DOCTOR X120
Well, it's @@@ sleep apnea.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
Um @@@ works as @@@.

PATIENT X120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X120
But for people like, like you and me and I have it as well.

PATIENT X120
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X120
And uh I don't know why.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.  Okay.

DOCTOR X120
@@@.

PATIENT X120
It's not gonna kill you, let's put it that way.

DOCTOR X120
Well you know, the problem is that holding your breath while you sleep and struggling against holding your breath.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
It can put a strain on your heart and your lungs.

PATIENT X120
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X120
Because you're creating high pressure inside your chest.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
And that straining can cause some damage.

PATIENT X120
It does.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah to the heart.

PATIENT X120
Could it have cause that tumor?

DOCTOR X120
It wouldn't cause a tumor but it can weaken the heart.

PATIENT X120
Okay.

DOCTOR X120
Quite a bit.

PATIENT X120
Then I got to do something about that then.

DOCTOR X120
So part of it is finding a CPAP machine that you like.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
Sort of finding a position where you sleep and don't hold your breath.  Are you going to see the pulmonologist again, have they reviewed that sleep study?

PATIENT X120
I hope so.  I don't know, who's it gonna be?

DOCTOR X120
There's one um.

PATIENT X120
Cause I want to get this taken care of cause I you know my heart took a beating with that surgery you know.  I ended up with a bad heart you know.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.  So this @@@.  

PATIENT X120
Yeah it's frightening.

DOCTOR X120
Hmm.  You may need to give DOCTOR a call.

PATIENT X120
Yeah okay.  @@@ where is she at, what medicine.

DOCTOR X120
She's uh; I think she's a pulmonologist.  I think she died suddenly.  You could call the main line and ask for the Sleep Clinic.

PATIENT X120
Okay.  Yeah.  What floor was that on 11 or something like that?  I don't even remember when I went up there.  I think it was up there, 14, 11, I don't know.

DOCTOR X120
@@@ to get it.  Alright.

PATIENT X120
Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
Still something to get.  So you had an MRI in the past.  How did you get through the MRI?

PATIENT X120
Well I didn't have this thing because I took the medication for a couple days before that and it wasn't a long trip into that machine.  It was kind of fast.  I think I was in there maybe 15 minutes if that but I know I wanted to come out of there every second I was in there you know.  I just told myself to stay there and get this done.  But it's a real bummer for me.  You know I can't stand being in there.  @@@ not good.  You know not good.  The guy can't hear me you know.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah.

PATIENT X120
And I'm scared of it you know.  Not to be a sissy about it.

DOCTOR X120
@@@.

PATIENT X120
It scared the shit out of me.

DOCTOR X120
@@@.

PATIENT X120
You know.  I been in a couple situations where I was in trouble and I remember that, it was like so if we can do the same thing that SET scan will give you, you know if that'll work or if you could knock me out.

DOCTOR X120
Yeah we may have to.  I don't know.  Let's see, let me ask DOCTOR, @@@.  Mind if I take a quick listen to you?

PATIENT X120
Yeah.  I'll take this shirt off for you.

PATIENT X120
Okay.

DOCTOR X120

PATIENT X120
Okay.  What's the MRI going to be looking for?

DOCTOR X120
So on the CT or sorry @@@ so you had the MRI.  The MRI showed a mass in one of the vertebrae of your neck.

PATIENT X120
Okay.

DOCTOR X120
That might be causing the pain.

PATIENT X120
Okay.

DOCTOR X120
And I'm not sure exactly what the mass is or what to do about it.

PATIENT X120
Okay.

DOCTOR X120
Um and we want to take a better look at it and make sure that one it's nothing dangerous.

PATIENT X120
Okay.

DOCTOR X120
And two that uh see that if it's causing the neck pain then we can get it fixed.

PATIENT X120
Right.

DOCTOR X120
So, I don't know.  With the history of the prostate cancer, we can never be too careful.

PATIENT X120
Right.

DOCTOR X120
I want to make sure it's nothing dangerous.

PATIENT X120

DOCTOR X120
So you have uh, what's the reason for this?  Have you seen the dentist before?

PATIENT X120
Well before I had the surgery they pulled a tooth you know.  Cause now I got one that's bothering but I'm not able to chew my food thoroughly.

Yeah.

DOCTOR X120
But not for a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X120
No they didn't do a colonoscopy.  I thought they were going to do a lower GI or something, what is that?

DOCTOR X120
That's the same thing.  

PATIENT X120
What's a lower GI?  Is that when they put all that barium in you?

DOCTOR X120
Uh sort a yeah.

PATIENT X120
That milky stuff, that white stuff?

DOCTOR X120
@@@.

PATIENT X120
O brother.  I don't know what they want but I thought she had said the lower GI.  I don't need that, I had one of those many years ago and.

DOCTOR X120
If you can get the GI consult, you need to get the labs drawn.

PATIENT X120
I had labs drawn yesterday.

DOCTOR X120
Uh.

PATIENT X120
Did you get them back yet?  She got about six or eight things drawn on me.

DOCTOR X120
Very low @@@.  Your hemoglobin A1c is normal, 6.3 moderately high so, let's do that again.  @@@ is normal.  All of your blood counts look just fine.  You're a little anemic.

PATIENT X120
What does that mean?

DOCTOR X120
That means uh that you have low red blood cells.  That's probably another reason why we need a colonoscopy.

PATIENT X120
Gotcha.

DOCTOR X120
It could be blood loss and otherwise looks pretty good and then your electrolytes and cholesterol are pretty good.  Actually fantastic.  You got great cholesterol.

PATIENT X120

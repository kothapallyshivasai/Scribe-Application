DOCTOR X398

PATIENT X398
Well now a week ago.

DOCTOR X398
And you started on 5 units of Aspart.

PATIENT X398
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X398
Before meals?

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
Three times a day?

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
And did you notice improvement in your sugars after you had gone up to 65?  @@@.

PATIENT X398
I think I did yeah and it's like after I eat dinner, around 6:30, 7 o'clock I'm not eating anything.

DOCTOR X398
@@@.  

PATIENT X398
When I'm waking up I'm checking my sugars, 260 you know, 240.

DOCTOR X398
Have you been @@@ a lot?

PATIENT X398
Oh yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X398
Have you been real thirsty?

PATIENT X398
No, not real thirsty.  When I wake up in the night I be thirsty.

DOCTOR X398
Any chest pain, fever, chills?

PATIENT X398
No.

DOCTOR X398
No trouble breathing?

PATIENT X398
No.

DOCTOR X398
What about @@@?  I mean obviously this does not, you know, help @@@ but what about exercise?

PATIENT X398
Yeah I try; I mean I try to walk a little bit yeah.  I might get on the treadmill and I might do seven minutes.  I know that ain't nothing but it's something.

DOCTOR X398
@@@ more than I've done.  I mean I don't expect you to run a marathon.

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
Now what happens?  Do you get real tired with that?

PATIENT X398
Oh I don't get tired @@@ but my hip.  I guess it's because it's not used you know.

DOCTOR X398
@@@ take Tylenol do you do that?

PATIENT X398
No.

DOCTOR X398
You don't want to take Tylenol?

PATIENT X398
Oh I have enough @@@ yeah @@@ you know if it's just for a few, you know, from exercise.

DOCTOR X398
The problem is as we get older we'll get arthritis @@@ right.

PATIENT X398
I don't know I may have that, especially here you know.

DOCTOR X398
Yeah so you know when your hip starts hurting, take the Tylenol before, about a half an hour you know before, sure just to kind of calm it down so you can keep walking.

PATIENT X398
Alright.

DOCTOR X398
Cause you're doing the right thing and I know that your intentions are great.

PATIENT X398
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X398
But you just got to keep going.  You've got to find a way so you can keep exercises cause what happens when you exercise the muscles use up the sugar and @@@ baseline they use it up without insulin okay.  That's the way the body's made you know.  The muscles, you know when you exercise they know that they can't wait for the insulin.

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
They predict you and they use the sugar @@@ and they're going to be dropping your sugar level and it's a natural way of the body controlling the diabetes.

PATIENT X398
Yeah like when I walk, I always get pain while I'm going, coming back it's you know, it's not too bad.

DOCTOR X398
Okay.  @@@ sugar is controlled @@@.  And @@@ I think we've got to be real aggressive with this.  @@@.  I'm gonna talk to my boss, DOCTOR @@@.  Possibly going to 75 @@@.

PATIENT X398
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X398
Possibly going to 75 and increasing the Aspart @@@.  See how the 75 does and if that's okay with the 5 and it's too high then we can increase again.

PATIENT X398
I can't @@@ anything.  Isn't my prescription supposed to be @@@.

DOCTOR X398
No.  @@@.  So you know you been diabetes right for nine years.  The pancreas which is the main organ involved with @@@ okay so when you first started @@@ it's not making insulin well.

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
Most of the cells are not working with the kidneys, but @@@ are working.  As time goes on the cells that are working start dying, they give up because they @@@.

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
It's like pumping.

PATIENT X398
Yeah they're doing all the work.

DOCTOR X398
Right so what you find is a lot of times people are controlled and some of those cells stop working and you get to the point that these cells kind of give up.  You know that's why @@@ anything so and that's one of the problems you're having is @@@ you know, what do you @@@ right.  But you know it's not, @@@ not getting better @@@.

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
You're eating fruits; you're eating good meals and watching it?

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
At home you told me your blood pressures are in the 130s @@@?

PATIENT X398
Yeah.  Between 125.

DOCTOR X398
Alright, so you know don't worry about the, you know I mentioned when you're at home just write them down for me, you know write them and kind of keep a log @@@.

PATIENT X398
Well I @@@ a couple weeks @@@.

DOCTOR X398
But just write them down for me and bring it in so I can actually see it.

PATIENT X398
Let's go up to uh @@@.  Even 10 on that Aspart.

DOCTOR X398
Uh I mean the Aspart I don't know if it's gonna do the trick.

PATIENT X398
I don't either but I can't, it's hard for me to @@@ with one eye.  It's easier for me to see the 10.

DOCTOR X398
@@@.

PATIENT X398
Than it is for me to try to @@@.

DOCTOR X398
We'll @@@, we'll go up on the Aspart dose.

PATIENT X398
Okay.

DOCTOR X398
And that'll help you out.  Other than that you been doing okay?

PATIENT X398
Yeah.

DOCTOR X398
Have a seat.  How's your vision been?

PATIENT X398
Uh pretty good.  @@@.

DOCTOR X398
Have you seen the eye doctor yet?

PATIENT X398
I go to the @@@ doctor for @@@ vision.

DOCTOR X398
Okay.

PATIENT X398
And @@@.

DOCTOR X398
And you're gonna see the eye doctor for anything?

PATIENT X398
No.

DOCTOR X398
Okay.  You can also pop by the clinic and @@@.

PATIENT X398
@@@.

DOCTOR X398
@@@.

PATIENT X398
Uh.

DOCTOR X398
@@@.

PATIENT X398
No @@@.

DOCTOR X398
@@@ yeah you should stop by the clinic and see what's going on.  Say ah for me.  Say ah.

PATIENT X398
Ah.

DOCTOR X398
But I know that some of this stuff would be definitely very helpful for your sugars.

PATIENT X398
@@@ you know even with my glasses I can't see my watch.

DOCTOR X398
Take a deep breath, again, again.  Breathe normal now, @@@.  Any leg swelling?

PATIENT X398
This one sometimes @@@.

DOCTOR X398
They both have a little swelling.  You're using the water pill right?

PATIENT X398
Yes.

DOCTOR X398
And when you're home are you elevating your legs?  You don't elevate them?

PATIENT X398
Yeah.

DOCTOR X398
Even when you're watching TV?

PATIENT X398
Hmm.

DOCTOR X398
Were you doing it?

PATIENT X398
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X398
Well when you're watching TV or just sitting down, you know what happens is you need to elevate it.

PATIENT X398
A lot of times I'm laying down and elevate it and when I go in the bed.

DOCTOR X398
Yeah.  @@@.  Your breath sounds are great.  

PATIENT X398
@@@.  

DOCTOR X398
Yeah @@@ great.  Those keep the bowel going.

PATIENT X398
@@@.  Lots of the medicine I'm taking it keeps me constipated.

DOCTOR X398
Right.  I might give you a couple of refills and if you happen to be running low call me.

PATIENT X398
Well I usually feel I @@@.  I mean I use @@@.

DOCTOR X398
@@@ four refills @@@.

PATIENT X398
Right.

DOCTOR X398
I'm going to go talk with my attending and I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  74:38  DOCTOR IN:  85:08)

DOCTOR X398
Okay.  We're going to go up @@@.  Um you're having a little problem @@@ and I know your vision is not the best so you just @@@ the line.

PATIENT X398
Right, right.  @@@ I have to look real close.  I have a magnifier, even with a magnifier it's hard you know.  Things are you know the line.

DOCTOR X398
Why don't you pop @@@.

PATIENT X398
Oh yeah I believe so.

DOCTOR X398
100%?  90%?  75%?

PATIENT X398
Well I don't @@@ but on my insulin I might be miss just maybe one line or two.

DOCTOR X398
So on the Aspart you want to make sure and give yourself 65.

PATIENT X398
And go up to 5 units.

DOCTOR X398
@@@.

PATIENT X398
Is it marked?  I might go halfway that's the way I've been judging it now.

DOCTOR X398
@@@ I think maybe you might not have to do maybe almost @@@ but maybe because of your vision then you have a hard time doing it.  That may have a lot to do with it.  

DOCTOR X398
Do you live by yourself or is there anybody at home that could help you with it?

PATIENT X398
I'm all by myself.

(Silence from 87:38 - 90:59)

DOCTOR X398
So this is the stuff we're trying to figure out.  We're trying, we're gonna try to get something different that's gonna help with that.  Instead of using the needle, we're going to try to give you these insulin tabs okay.  Instead of drawing blood, like drawing into a syringe you're going, it's a pump, not a pump but a little contraption okay and then it'll show the number on it. 

PATIENT X398
Oh.

DOCTOR X398
Instead of drawing and looking at the lines, you're going to set it for numbers and we think it is something that will help and it has a little insulin bottle.  Do you think that's be a lot easier than the insulin?

PATIENT X398
Yeah.  So I was going to tell you was I made a mistake, one or two units too much and not too less.

DOCTOR X398
Okay.  Do you hold @@@?

PATIENT X398
I could be I mean, if that's my probably @@@.  Cause I have a problem counting those lines, I'm not going to go, I'm not going to go over you know.

DOCTOR X398
So let's see.  I think if that could work and we could get @@@ right.  So if that's going to be a lot easier anyway and we should be 100% sure exactly how much you have okay.  Does that sound like fun?

PATIENT X398
Whatever you want to do.  What about this Losartan?

DOCTOR X398
Oh yeah it's a blood thinner.

PATIENT X398
Oh I thought it was for the @@@.

DOCTOR X398
Yeah it is for the @@@ cause the problem is your blood pressure and your sugar, those are the two most important things.  We got to get your blood pressure and sugars corrected okay and no overloading your sugars.  So your blood pressure @@@ okay.

PATIENT X398
Yeah the blood pressure's fine cause it has dropped down to 113, 118 you know.  Like I said, most of the time at home it's pretty good you know because all these 120s, anywhere from 120-133 I'll say it like that.  It's never in the 140s at home.  That's why I'm so surprised that they get 147.

DOCTOR X398
Well let me go check with him once more.

(DOCTOR OUT:  93:29)  DOCTOR IN:  94:10)

FIRST DOCTOR X398
We'll have you on your way we just want to check out one more spot.

SECOND DOCTOR X398
Alright.

PATIENT X398
Hi.

SECOND DOCTOR X398
So um the only um, @@@ the only change is that um @@@ Glargine and @@@.  The @@@ is actually cheaper @@@ VA physician prefers.  Glargine can @@@.

PATIENT X398
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X398
So that was their preferred action.  @@@.  There are two @@@ but can you feel it click, to get the dose as opposed to having to measure you know.

PATIENT X398
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR X398
So it's easier for people who can't see 100% anymore.  @@@ and I guess @@@.  

FIRST DOCTOR X398
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X398
Yes definitely.  Okay, good.

FIRST DOCTOR X398
Alright we'll do that.

PATIENT X398
Sounds good.

FIRST DOCTOR X398
We'll try to do this.  

PATIENT X398
But I can still take them at the same time?

FIRST DOCTOR X398
Yeah the same.

PATIENT X398
@@@ don't mix them.

FIRST DOCTOR X398
So it looks right now, a couple of things.  I'm willing to go up to 70 as long as you're more sure that you're giving yourself.  How confident are you that you're giving yourself @@@?

PATIENT X398
Um well I @@@.

DOCTOR X398
@@@ so we'll do 70.  And 7 units at night right?

PATIENT X398
Yes.

DOCTOR X398
@@@ have anything @@@. Actually you could probably pick it up at the window if you like.

PATIENT X398

DOCTOR X398

PATIENT X398
Uh is this the, this is the one for the heart.

DOCTOR X398

PATIENT X398
@@@.  The last time they gave me 160 refills.

DOCTOR X398
Before?

PATIENT X398
Yeah and I did then, but I don't know why they not charging me now.  Somebody made a mistake somehow.  I never get refills after you take so much of this like I said @@@.  So right now I'm going to the Kidney Center and they want to talk about dialysis.  

DOCTOR X398
@@@ it always help just having it @@@ refills so you know you just put the little @@@ they'll show you how to do it.  Put the cartridges in, select the number and @@@.

DOCTOR X398

PATIENT X398

DOCTOR X398

PATIENT X398

DOCTOR X398
Simvastatin.  Are you using the Vicodin still?

PATIENT X398
No, I haven't.

DOCTOR X398

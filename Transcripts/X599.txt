DOCTOR X599
Do you get short of breath if you don't or?

PATIENT X599
You know sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.  When you usually go through a flight of stairs or just when?

PATIENT X599
Oh stairs, the stairs kill me.

DOCTOR X599

PATIENT X599
I'm moving out.  I'm staying with my son now.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
But I'm getting ready to move where there ain't no stairs, the stairs are killing me.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
But uh.

DOCTOR X599
Um.

PATIENT X599
If I walk around real slow I'm alright.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  And when you have your oxygen on are you fine usually?

PATIENT X599

DOCTOR X599
Still a little short of breath when you move.

PATIENT X599
Still, it ain't no difference you know.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT X599
I feel hurt right up in here.  The pain, it hurts right up in here.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
You know something, dropping it's something a little bit more.  This is mild pain.  There's some a little bit more complicated than what uh what the doctors think it is cause it's been there five years.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
And it's been the same thing.  It's the same thing.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
It ain't getting no worse but it ain't getting no better.

DOCTOR X599
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X599
You know I can't walk upstairs.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
Can't walk a long distance.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And it's steady and it's constant.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
If I was 25 or 30 years younger I'd have to do exploratory surgery cause.

DOCTOR X599
You don't want that, trust me, you don't want that.

PATIENT X599
No, I don't want that.

DOCTOR X599
You've had, I mean you've had like heart worked up before cause besides your heart was checked and your heart, if I remember correctly looked fine right?

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.  So that's good in that respect um.  It's a combination of things.  It's your lung disease, the COPD um combined with the obstructive sleep apnea you have.  Are you using the CPAP still anyway?  Do you use it every night or half a night?

PATIENT X599
Every night.  When I'm sleeping but when I sleeping light.  I'll go to sleep at 9 or 10 o'clock and I'll wake up at 2 in the morning.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And then I'm up until 8, 9 or 10 o'clock the next night.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
You know sometimes I take a nap, sometimes I don't.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  Is it the breathing that keeps you from sleeping well or what is it or you just never having a good sleep really?

PATIENT X599
Uh you know it's hard to you know, it's hard to say.  It is hard to pinpoint.  It all depends on it because.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
I been like that ever since I uh came from Vietnam.  You know I couldn't get a good night's sleep and this carried on over the last four years because for that one year I was over there.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
I was up at all different times of the night.  You know I never got no more than three, four hours sleep.  Maybe five some nights if it was that much and it just carried over, over the years.

DOCTOR X599
Do you find yourself dozing off during the day sometimes?

PATIENT X599
No.

DOCTOR X599
You don't doze off?

PATIENT X599
No, you know that lady, that doctor up in the hospital had me, made me admit to that but you know what I don't doze off during the day.

DOCTOR X599
You don't.

PATIENT X599
No.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
But see I was up there, I was up there and they had me on so many different type of drugs, I don't know what I was doing up there or what I was saying.

DOCTOR X599
What do you do for your blood pressure right now?

PATIENT X599
Um carvedilol.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
@@@.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And it start with a d, what is that?

DOCTOR X599
Diltiazem?

PATIENT X599
@@@ that.

DOCTOR X599
They had increased some of your stuff.  Have you taken the higher doses?

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
You have been?  Cause your blood pressures are a little bit high so do you?

PATIENT X599
This morning.

DOCTOR X599
Did you take it this morning?

PATIENT X599
This morning I forgot to take my carvedilol.

DOCTOR X599
Okay, okay, sure.

PATIENT X599
I forgot to take it.

DOCTOR X599
Sure, yeah uh that happens a lot um.

PATIENT X599
And because you know I take it, I took it last night at 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
So at 5 o'clock that was too early.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
To take it again.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
But see I'm up every night at 5 in the morning.

DOCTOR X599
Right.

PATIENT X599
I want to take all my medication at 5 in the morning but if I take it at 7 or 8 at night you know that ain't 12 hours.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah and I mean it doesn't have to be 12 hours on the dot.  If it's between not taking it at 12 hours on the dot or.

PATIENT X599
Taking it.

DOCTOR X599
Taking it then we'd rather you just take it at like eight hours than not taking it at all so.

PATIENT X599
And uh since they increased that carvedilol I got, like water or something is in my ear you know.

DOCTOR X599
Some.

PATIENT X599
Yeah you know, it does it just like a 300 gram of aspirin do me.  I can't take a high volume aspirin.

DOCTOR X599
Oh.

PATIENT X599
Cause I do this, you know I feel something like a echo.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  Does it affect your hearing?

PATIENT X599
No.

DOCTOR X599
It doesn't affect your hearing okay.

PATIENT X599
Just uncomfortable.

DOCTOR X599
Okay, alright.  Do you check your blood pressure at home by any chance?

PATIENT X599
Uh I don't have a machine.

DOCTOR X599
You don't, oh we can get you one.

PATIENT X599
And they uh, they wanted me to get one of those oxygen monitors.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah that actually wouldn't be a bad idea either.

PATIENT X599
But uh.

DOCTOR X599
@@@.

PATIENT X599
But I don't uh, at home, right here I feel pretty good but see at home I got some carpet on the floor.  I think I'm allergic to that carpet where I stay at.

DOCTOR X599
Why do you say that, what is it?

PATIENT X599
You see I can't breathe sometimes.  But when I leave it, when I leave it.

DOCTOR X599
Does it stop when you're gone?

PATIENT X599
Sometimes.  When I leave the house I'm good.

DOCTOR X599
Okay um.  How old is this where you're staying?

PATIENT X599
Oh it's a new place.  Could be how cheap is the carpet right.

DOCTOR X599
It's new?  Yeah or if it's had mold on your carpet but it's brand new.

PATIENT X599
I have no, the carpet ain't brand new.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
And you know what, you're probably right because when my son moved in to the apartment, see I stay with my son now.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
The apartment, the carpets looked like it was dirty but they say they had cleaned it so it was probably what you said mold on those carpets.

DOCTOR X599
It's possible and that can really aggravate your lung disease.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.  My son will be walking around sniffling.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
He don't know, he don't know nothing about it now.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
He ain't figured it out yet.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
But I done figured out about that carpet.  He better off not having it.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah that's true actually.  Would you rather pick it up or would you rather it sent to your house?

PATIENT X599
What's that?

DOCTOR X599
The blood pressure cuff and the O2 machine?

PATIENT X599
Well I'll be back down this Thursday the 10th.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
I could pick it up.

DOCTOR X599
Do you know where to pick it up?

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  I'll have it ready for you so it's there um.

PATIENT X599
And uh other than that you know I don't know why you increased that carvedilol on me uh.

DOCTOR X599
What was the reason?  It looks like your blood pressure was pretty high while you were in the hospital.

PATIENT X599
They made it that high.

DOCTOR X599
Because they aggravated you?

PATIENT X599
I ain't gonna say that, I ain't gonna say a word.

DOCTOR X599
Well you know it's, I mean.  They did the increased dose.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
You keep checking your blood pressure at home, if they're low or if you're getting nauseated or dizzy, then certainly we should back off a little bit okay.

PATIENT X599
I don't get nauseated.  I don't get dizzy.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah, yeah.  Those are usually the side effects that we see with if the carvedilol dose is too high.

PATIENT X599
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X599
I mean if you get those and your blood pressures are low, lower than normal, um cause your blood pressure usually runs high so if you start getting blood pressures like 100, 110, then maybe that's a little bit too aggressive and we can back off a little.

PATIENT X599
That's what I was getting.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
I missed the two tablets this morning.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And it's at 147.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.  Well what 147 is still considered high.

PATIENT X599
But see some doctors say they like to see my blood pressure at 130.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah less than 130.

PATIENT X599
Yeah less than 130.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah it's higher than 130.

PATIENT X599
Right but.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
That worries me but anybody say well 147's alright for you.  You know I say what you know what can I say?

DOCTOR X599
The goal is less than 130.  If it's running in the 140s then we can be okay with it but we would prefer not cause you're 62, you're still young.

PATIENT X599
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X599
Relatively.  With all ages right here that we see.

PATIENT X599
Oh yeah I know.

DOCTOR X599
So.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
So you still have a lot of years left.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
So you have your blood pressures all crazy now, that's gonna cut years off of your life.

PATIENT X599
Right, right.

DOCTOR X599
So we might as well be a little more aggressive if we can.

PATIENT X599
And there's something else I be wondering too.  They gave me these two things up there, where you know you inhale them.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X599
One got a cap though.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And the other one got uh Tylenol.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
What is that with the one with the counter?  I don't see nothing in there.

DOCTOR X599
Is it?

PATIENT X599
Is it liquid or what?

DOCTOR X599
The, do you put it into the unit or is it?

PATIENT X599
One of them you don't put nothing in it you just take the cap off.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And the counter goes, you know there's a counter on it, it's 60 doses.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And the counter goes there and you inhale it.

DOCTOR X599
And you like click the lever or whatever and you inhale it real quick?  Is there a lever or anything that you push?

PATIENT X599
You talking about the one with the capsule.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah let me see which ones you're on.

PATIENT X599
You talking about the one with the capsule.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
Now that's the only one that I can feel and I can inhale it.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
But uh that other one.

DOCTOR X599
You don't feel like there's anything in it?

PATIENT X599
I don't feel like nothing's coming out, that's what I say uh.

DOCTOR X599
Oh.

PATIENT X599
I even took it one time and turned it over upside down.  I didn't see nothing come out.

DOCTOR X599
You know the best thing to do in that instance is probably to bring it to the Pharmacy next time you're here and ask them about it and say hey look at this is it really working.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
So yeah, bring it in.

PATIENT X599
But I'm trying to say do I really need it?

DOCTOR X599
You do for your lung disease.  One's called mometasone.

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
And that is supposed to be twice a day.

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
And what's the other one they have you on, let's see.  Do you take albuterol, does that sound familiar?

PATIENT X599
I got some albuterol.  I got that which is  use as needed.

DOCTOR X599
How often are you using that?

PATIENT X599
Well I used it last night.  It seemed to work.

DOCTOR X599
It does?

PATIENT X599
I feel like, you know after I used the two powders.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
Uh I be stopped up.  Something's happening down there with them two powders and uh you know I can't breathe after using those two powders.  I believe that's what it is.  See I mean, I know you doctors like to over medication but.

DOCTOR X599
Formoterol, that's what it is.

PATIENT X599
That's what I got?

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
But that's the powder.

DOCTOR X599
You're on formoterol.

PATIENT X599
What about the other powder though?

DOCTOR X599
You only have two medicines for your lungs disease right, so probably the albuterol.  Albuterol is the one you use.

PATIENT X599
Correct.

DOCTOR X599
The formoterol and mometasone are the two inhalers.

PATIENT X599
Okay.  One of them is a little capsule.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
That's the one you drop in the little machine.

DOCTOR X599
And then you inhale it.

PATIENT X599
Squeeze it.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
And inhale it.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
Now I feel that.

DOCTOR X599
Yes.

PATIENT X599
That other one, you just screw the cap off and a counter, I don't feel nothing coming out of that.

DOCTOR X599
The best thing to do is just bring it into the Pharmacy and let them look at it.

PATIENT X599
What does that do though?  Do I need them both?

DOCTOR X599
You do need them both cause they do different things.  One is, one is to make your airways bigger.

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
So more air can come in and one is to decrease the inflammation that you have going in there.  So they work differently.

PATIENT X599
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah cause we can make your airways bigger but if you have a ton of inflammation then it's not going to do anything right?

PATIENT X599
It'll clean it out huh?

DOCTOR X599
Right or we can get rid of the inflammation but if your airway is still teeny tiny that's not gonna help either.

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
So that's why you need both to kind of work together.

PATIENT X599
Okay.

DOCTOR X599
Um the albuterol, I know you're saying helps you, you seem to feel like it but the albuterol is supposed to be only as needed and we try to make it so that you're other medications control your breathing so that you only need albuterol maybe once or twice a month if even.

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
Cause albuterol is not supposed to be like a daily or even weekly thing.  We try to keep it to a minimum cause if you're having to use it every day or you know almost every day that means you're not well controlled enough with your other stuff.

PATIENT X599
Okay now do they have anything that you can get a breathing treatment with at home?

DOCTOR X599
Yeah, I think so.  You like the breathing treatments you get in the hospital?

PATIENT X599
Yeah sometimes.  Yeah they work.

DOCTOR X599
With the humidifier.

PATIENT X599
Yeah they got something you can take that at home.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah I think so, let me find out for you.

PATIENT X599
Okay.

DOCTOR X599
I'm pretty sure there is yeah.

PATIENT X599
And uh.

DOCTOR X599
What is your um, have you been checking your um blood sugar?

PATIENT X599
Oh yes, it's uh I'm starting to get it back under control now, but when I went into the hospital they would give, all they would give me is short-acting insulin.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.  Unfortunately you know the hospital.  So what are you taking right now?

PATIENT X599
15.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
Of long-acting.

DOCTOR X599
Okay, once a day or twice a day?

PATIENT X599
Twice a day.

DOCTOR X599
Twice a day.

PATIENT X599
And 15 of fast-acting.

DOCTOR X599
Okay with each meal.

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
Okay and what are your morning sugars looking like?

PATIENT X599
I got them back down to 90 or 120.

DOCTOR X599
Good, wonderful.

PATIENT X599
You know uh anytime it's above 90 and 120, that mean I don't woke up eating something.

DOCTOR X599
Oh okay.

PATIENT X599
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X599
At least.

PATIENT X599
With eggs then I wake up in the morning and I'll check and maybe 160.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah do you write them down?

PATIENT X599
No I don't.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  Well, do you think you can start writing them down and then we'll set you up with our pharmacists so they can take a good look at it and see if there's room to go up because your A1c which is the number we use to follow your diabetes.

PATIENT X599
Right.

DOCTOR X599
Got way up.

PATIENT X599
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah it was, its 9., let me make sure so I'm not lying to you what it is, it is 9.3 when you had lab work done last week.

PATIENT X599
Okay.

DOCTOR X599
It was 7.4 in July.

PATIENT X599
So it went up 2 points.

DOCTOR X599
So way, way off in the wrong direction.

PATIENT X599
Well why would it, why would it made it do that?

DOCTOR X599
It's probably a combination of a lot of different things.  I think because we didn't cut it in and out of the hospital a lot since July.

PATIENT X599
Maybe it's been @@@ uh once or twice.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah, yeah, in September or whatever.  So usually there's not and if we keep @@@ controlled there and then um I don't know what else has been going on, I don't know if you've been having missing meals or eating too much sweets or this and that, little things can always do it.

PATIENT X599
Oh okay.  Well that's a task; I'll get it back down.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
That was just a little score right?

DOCTOR X599
The 7 yes, 7 is the goal, if we get it down to 7 for the A1c.  Um so why don't, if you can why don't you or actually does your monitor keep um.

PATIENT X599
The date and time.

DOCTOR X599
Does it keep track of it?

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
So you don't even need to write down.

PATIENT X599
I brought it into her last week.

DOCTOR X599
Oh you did?  Did you bring it to our Pharmacy Clinic here?

PATIENT X599
Yeah, I seen them last week.

DOCTOR X599
For @@@.

PATIENT X599
@@@ Center right.

DOCTOR X599
And did they check your?

PATIENT X599
She checked it.  She told me just what you said keep a log.

DOCTOR X599
Oh okay, okay.

PATIENT X599
Keep a log and write down what I eat.

DOCTOR X599
Good, good.

PATIENT X599
You know cause.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah I mean for you, I mean you come in and seem them like once a week right?

PATIENT X599
Yeah they adjust my walker.

DOCTOR X599
Okay, okay, so then it seems like they kind of check on your diabetes as well.

PATIENT X599
That too.  

DOCTOR X599
Good.

PATIENT X599
They do that.

DOCTOR X599
Good okay.

PATIENT X599
They uh, you know they do all that, you know.

DOCTOR X599
Good, good.

PATIENT X599
Are you gonna be my permanent doctor or?

DOCTOR X599
We're gonna try.  We can try to make it that way um, we kind of switch around a lot.  So we try to keep seeing the same patient over and over but every now and then it, we have to.

PATIENT X599
Yeah cause I had one doctor he left.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah.

PATIENT X599
He was my doctor for almost a year.

DOCTOR X599

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
So you know, he was alright, I hate to see him go.

DOCTOR X599

PATIENT X599

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
This oxygen, they got more modern stuff than this but the VA they won't give it to you.  They got some equipment that keep you out, where you can stay out for eight hours.

DOCTOR X599

You know that's the first thing I did when I went out and bought those cigarettes.

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599
Got back in the car, opened them up and smoked it.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X599
Don't say you are the devil.

DOCTOR X599
But you can't smoke around the oxygen either.

PATIENT X599
Yeah well I don't have it on, you know I ain't crazy.

DOCTOR X599
Either way, I mean there could be like a small leak that you don't know about I mean.

PATIENT X599
Don't you know that can happen to me before?

DOCTOR X599
Right, you're increases your changes.

PATIENT X599
But I don't do that no more, with those cigarettes, back to those cigarettes.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
That's the hardest thing I ever had to do, quit smoking cigarettes.

DOCTOR X599
Yes, yeah no I can understand.  Alright, I'll be back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  85:58  DOCTOR IN: 98:24)

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  So you can get those nebulizers at home, I can order it.  So the actual medication you need to pick up from the Pharmacy but the actual equipment to do a nebulizer.

PATIENT X599
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X599
You can get from Prosthetics.

PATIENT X599
Okay.

DOCTOR X599
So let me put this in.  You'll probably like those better anyway huh.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
That seems to work better for you.

PATIENT X599
Well you know it makes it seem like it do how.

DOCTOR X599
No I mean it works differently.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
So um it's called Combivent and it's a brand name but it's a combination of albuterol and ipratropium.  I don't know what the name is.

PATIENT X599
Oh that's what this supposed to be?

DOCTOR X599
Yeah that's what the nebulizer treatment is.

PATIENT X599
Then you do it once a night, at night before you go to bed.

DOCTOR X599
Three times a day.

PATIENT X599
Three times a day.

DOCTOR X599
Yeah uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah if you want um I mean if you go and leave the house a lot I can prescribe the nebulizer and the inhaler then you can do nebulizers only at night and do the inhalers during the day.

PATIENT X599
Yeah.

DOCTOR X599
How would that sound?

PATIENT X599
That's alright.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
Cause I don't want to sit at the house.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  So why don't we, um we'll plan on um doing the inhalers um during the daytime.

PATIENT X599
Alright.

DOCTOR X599
And do the nebulizers at night.

PATIENT X599
Okay.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.

PATIENT X599
But usually we like to say like every six hours or so but you know I mean people are busy.  I doubt anyone ever gets every six hours but if you can get it in three or four times a day that'd be ideal.

DOCTOR X599
Okay.  So let make sure you get that and then continue the mometasone.  Do you need refills on that?

PATIENT X599
The who now?

DOCTOR X599
Mometasone, that's the new one that you got.

PATIENT X599
The powder?

DOCTOR X599
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X599

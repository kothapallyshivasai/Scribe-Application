DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X717
@@@ and that's the way it happened.

DOCTOR X717
When they were working, when they were trying to figure out what's going on with the pain down there?

PATIENT X717
They knew what was going on down there.  @@@ he was glad to see me in a year.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X717
He says no, no, you gonna do this and then what he did, he went on messing around with my, with my uh @@@.

DOCTOR X717
I've got to look here and see what they were talking about.

PATIENT X717
So my problem is once I got out of this, I thought I got out of this, I still this side just a @@@ and @@@ a day got me a clip @@@.  This one over here @@@.

PATIENT X717
Uh let me find here, what is it?

SECOND PERSON X717
Dilaudid.  He's on Dilaudid.  His problem here today.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
It's I wanted him to come here to it's just that, I was hoping that ya'll would do a follow-up.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
On his electrolytes.  He had an electrolytes imbalance I think.

DOCTOR X717
That's because of the thyroid.

SECOND PERSON X717
His calcium, his phosphorus, everything is fine?

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Well all his electrolytes.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Plus his pain was not controlled okay.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Plus they said he might have a hernia, that's why I'm here today and then the main reason why I wanted a follow-up appointment, today's appointment.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Is they still have not set up a @@@ appointment.  They have not controlled the pain even though he had the Fentanyl patch.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
He has the Lidoderm patch and he's had Dilaudid, but his pain is not controlled and there an anxiety medication or medicine but his pain is not controlled even though he's under Hospice @@@.  Uh more than any problem it seems that his pain is out of control.  The new problem, the new secondary problem for the cancer.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Is this uh, I don't want to diagnosis, is this possible rule out a hernia.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
He has a knot that he did not have after the surgery in December or January.  Now it's real prominent.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And when you do your um your examination.

DOCTOR X717
I need to take a look at it.

SECOND PERSON X717
When you examine him, I'm sure when you palpate, you will see it.  It's very prominent and we've been putting Lidoderm patches on it.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And um and it's not you know, the @@@ aren't controlled you know with the Fentanyl patch or the Dilaudid.  Dilaudid is given every two hours.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
And the Fentanyl patch is every 72 hours.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And um this a lot of the patch is local with every 12 hours on, on for 12 hours, off for 12 hours but um that is not um.

DOCTOR X717
Where do you get the Lidoderm patch from cause I don't see it in here?

PATIENT X717
Uh that ones from.

SECOND PERSON X717
It's from his hospice doctor.

DOCTOR X717
Oh from the hospice doctor okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh-huh.  And um my husband is very uncomfortable with abdominal pain and discomfort, it may be a possible hernia.  Uh we don't know what it is.

DOCTOR X717
And this has happened since December?

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh since January when we were discharged.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
But I mean, it was probably there all along but I mean it's probably growing larger to now to where it's like protruding out.  He's had two uh bowel obstruction surgeries, 2003, July 2003 the bowel obstruction surgery and then after that he had a lot of adhesions and another bowel obstruction in 2011 July at the Little Company of xxx.

DOCTOR X717
July of 2011?

SECOND PERSON X717
2003 he had a bowel obstruction surgery.

DOCTOR X717
Okay uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And also 2011 July, same month, bowel obstruction surgery with adhesions and they did something else in terms of repairing the bowel and he had a partial left nephrectomy in 2003 and that's what he was trying to say to you.

DOCTOR X717
That's what he was referring to okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
And also he was referring to he was first diagnosed with lung cancer in um 2003.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
But you know I wasn't present and he just didn't even, you know @@@ didn't think nothing of it when they were first talking about they saw some spots on his lungs.

DOCTOR X717
Right.

SECOND PERSON X717
But when they once they saw an obstruction was in July 2011 when he came in, when he became short of breath and they were suspicious of COPD.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And they was trying to, that's when they did the uh scans and all the x-rays and stuff that's when they saw the obstruction in the left lung and then when they did the CAT scan and all the other stuff that they did they came up with the lung uh CA and then they started staging it and they got the stage IV and they weren't able to proceed with the chemo, radiation at that time.

DOCTOR X717
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
So they went on with the palliative care and the Hospice care which has not brought him the comfort that everyone is thinking it's supposed to do.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
But one of the things that has not happened, cause the pain is not controlled.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
And the new problem, also @@@.

DOCTOR X717
Yeah it's sleep apnea @@@ but that's okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh they're not gonna @@@ it.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I want you to tell him because this stuff is subjective.  I want him to tell you what's going on with him.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And he did and I'm just, I'm just his wife, I understand what I assess is that his pain is not controlled.

DOCTOR X717
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X717
And if the medicine is given every two hours, @@@ you know, take two or three pills every two hours.  Dilaudid is stronger than Vicodin.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And that is that's upsetting to me.

DOCTOR X717
What happens when he takes it, does he get like really knocked out or is he, does it improve his pain or what happens when he takes the pills of the Dilaudid.

SECOND PERSON X717
What happens?

PATIENT X717
It knocks me out.

DOCTOR X717
It knocks out the pain?

PATIENT X717
Around 45 minutes, I don't know 50 uh @@@ at 1:00 it's just about gone now @@@.  Uh going on 45 minutes over and uh then it, you know I been going this long anyway.

SECOND PERSON X717
So one of the other problems that I assess is that we're gonna give him, he was taking Ativan.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
And um then they gave him an anti-anxiety medicine.

DOCTOR X717
Looks like they gave him Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON X717
And uh what is the other one, there's two of them?

DOCTOR X717
Olanzapine and Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh olanzapine.  He does not take the olanzapine.  He becomes very anxious, very, very anxious.

DOCTOR X717
And you have that at home or do you need more refills of it?

SECOND PERSON X717
But we need refills of that.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
I didn't give him the um @@@ the other one but the @@@.

DOCTOR X717
Oh that's the Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON X717
The Seroquel.

PATIENT X717
@@@.

DOCTOR X717
That's at night, that's the one at night.

SECOND PERSON X717
Right but.

PATIENT X717
But I need the hydrocodone, what is that one?

SECOND PERSON X717
Um this is the Dilaudid; I can't pronounce the other one.

PATIENT X717
Probenecid.

SECOND PERSON X717
He needs that but what.

DOCTOR X717
Well we could always go up to the patch too.  The patch is a low dose right now.

SECOND PERSON X717
Right it's 50.

DOCTOR X717
Right.

SECOND PERSON X717
It's at 50 and it's uh every uh every 17 hours.

DOCTOR X717
And you say it doesn't give him @@@.

PATIENT X717
@@@ uh the patch.

DOCTOR X717
Are you able to get up here?

PATIENT X717
Huh?

SECOND PERSON X717
Well why is he so anxious because he's got pain control?

DOCTOR X717
Yeah, well yeah I mean.

SECOND PERSON X717
Um he gets real angry and he's real upset.

DOCTOR X717
That could be it definitely.

SECOND PERSON X717
Is the medicine every two hours?  Isn't that too much?

DOCTOR X717
Um I mean it is a lot but it's all about getting his pain under control.  I mean if it isn't enough then he might have to take more you know.  

SECOND PERSON X717
So he takes, he could maybe take three pills every two hours.

DOCTOR X717
No, no, let me talk to my boss first and we'll decide what we're gonna do about, about the pain medications.  So he's also taking the, he's also taking the uh hydrocodone?

SECOND PERSON X717
What's the second one?

DOCTOR X717
Yeah that's uh the Norco or the Vicodin.

SECOND PERSON X717
No.  No, no, no, no, no.  He's not taking Vicodin.

PATIENT X717
Right there.

SECOND PERSON X717
He's taking the Dilaudid.

DOCTOR X717
He's taking Dilaudid three times a day.

SECOND PERSON X717
Dilaudid and Fentanyl.

PATIENT X717
Yeah that's it.

DOCTOR X717
The Lidoderm, he's taking the Lidoderm.

SECOND PERSON X717
But he has to have the Ativan.

PATIENT X717
It only working two hours.

SECOND PERSON X717
The Ativan, what's this one pill called Zyprexa?

DOCTOR X717
Zyprexa um I think um I think that's the olanzapine.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah but he has to have the Ativan and he's just.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
So you think that we should take the um.

DOCTOR X717
Let me talk to my boss and see if we can give him Ativan um to ease the anxiety.  So and you guys talked about this with the hospice doctor, they don't want to give him Ativan or what's the problem?

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah he gave the Ativan with the Zyprexa cause that's the only way he can face it or otherwise he's really anxious.

DOCTOR X717
So how come the hospice doctor didn't like give him that because they give him those meds.

SECOND PERSON X717
He's on Ativan, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
He's on Ativan and um Zyprexa.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh I have to give this here, when I've given it at q hs we were giving it, I give it uh at least twice a day cause they only ordered it once a day for sleep at night but that's not the case well the new problem is anxiety I got to give it more than once a day.  I have to give Ativan and Zyprexa.  I didn't give the other pill at all because I didn't, the one that you gave, I didn't give that.

DOCTOR X717
Okay Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON X717
Seroquel.  Only thing I give is the Zyprexa and I give Ativan cause he was taking Ativan before he was admitted on Christmas to the VA Hospital.

DOCTOR X717
Did the Hospice run out or is he still getting that at home?

SECOND PERSON X717
What?

DOCTOR X717
The Hospice care?

SECOND PERSON X717
He's still getting the Hospice care.

DOCTOR X717
So how come these meds are not getting titrated up like the Fentanyl and other pain meds, how come they're not doing that as part of Hospice?

SECOND PERSON X717
You're the one that um.

PATIENT X717
No she have a meeting.  She comes to uh work on me but we having an appointment on the same day she come to see me she's telling us to talk to the doctor and get the medication.

DOCTOR X717
That's what she said @@@ talk to the doctor.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah because she didn't have uh.

PATIENT X717
Yeah when I see her whatever.

DOCTOR X717
Because of what?

SECOND PERSON X717
She doesn't know probably gonna control of it, you know the medicine.

DOCTOR X717
They @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Right if they gonna change it or what they gonna do.

DOCTOR X717
Okay so @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
You know they have @@@ pain then after that.

PATIENT X717

SECOND PERSON X717
But after that they'll follow up.

PATIENT X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
They want to see what you gave him.  Yeah take that off so you can.  They want to see what ya'll are gonna do then I expect they'll follow up.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
What she's saying is rather than her to order more medicines to go up here.

PATIENT X717
Yeah uh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Rather than us oh the other problem we had is constipation which is from the.

PATIENT X717
Hold on mother; hold off one thing at a time.

SECOND PERSON X717
She @@@ talking about that too.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Cause he has a real bad problem with constipation.

PATIENT X717
You have to talk @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
He, can you hear what I'm saying?

DOCTOR X717
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X717
And he's the important one to hear me.

PATIENT X717
@@@ that be alright.

DOCTOR X717
Alright so where's the pain you're talking about, right where is it.

SECOND PERSON X717
Take it off, take it off so he can see the.  Lay down so he can.

PATIENT X717
See here, @@@ it flat.

SECOND PERSON X717
He can take it off.  If you lay down he'll see it.

DOCTOR X717
That?

PATIENT X717
Uh-huh, yeah it feels like the.

DOCTOR X717
Have a seat now.

PATIENT X717
Alright it come out and when I lay down.

DOCTOR X717
Just relax.

PATIENT X717
It usually goes away.

DOCTOR X717
Just relax.

PATIENT X717
Feel that, that, feel it.  It's fat, it ain't water in there.  @@@ me.

SECOND PERSON X717
Be still.

PATIENT X717
Huh?

DOCTOR X717
That hurts a lot?

PATIENT X717
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X717
Yeah it does feel like a hernia.

SECOND PERSON X717
That's I'm here for.

DOCTOR X717
Could be an abdominal wall hernia.

PATIENT X717
It would go @@@ and hard cause I can feel it, feel it right there?

DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

PATIENT X717
Right there.

DOCTOR X717
Yeah.  That hurts?

PATIENT X717
Yeah, yeah, that, that there.  Then it worse @@@.

DOCTOR X717
Take some deep breaths in let me hear.  Alright I mean I think it is a hernia. I don't think that um because of his other illnesses that they're gonna want to do surgery on this but we can definitely just try to control the pain for it.

SECOND PERSON X717
He's not a good candidate for.

DOCTOR X717
For surgery.

SECOND PERSON X717
And I mean this is what I assess.

DOCTOR X717
Right.  He would not be I don't think.

SECOND PERSON X717
I mean for me cause he's had tremendous weight loss since November.  I mean I'm always in tears cause we have to deal with this.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Because uh he's so thin.  I mean I don’t know what to do.

DOCTOR X717
Are you eating enough?  Like what's going on?

PATIENT X717
I eat @@@.

DOCTOR X717
No appetite?

PATIENT X717
No my diet is liquid you know so.

DOCTOR X717
Are you drinking Ensures and things like that?

PATIENT X717
Right.

SECOND PERSON X717
Hmm.

DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

PATIENT X717
I wanted to see, you know I've been.

SECOND PERSON X717
He wanted to see how thin he is.

DOCTOR X717
Yeah.  I don't see any ulcers here.

SECOND PERSON X717
It was bare skin where maybe it's looking good.

PATIENT X717
Oh that healed up, yeah that healed up.

DOCTOR X717
That's healed up.

SECOND PERSON X717
Can I say something, why such a tremendous weight loss?

DOCTOR X717
Because of the cancer.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh.

DOCTOR X717
That's what happens.

SECOND PERSON X717
Well whatever you want done for him.  The reason why I insisted I come back to the VA, whatever he got in December for those nine days, he wasn't eaten nothing.  He wasn't drinking much but when he came in here and they gave him all the IV therapy and they gave all the stuff they gave him.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Whatever they gave him.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
They had him on, they gave him a different @@@, now he's eating cause initially the tumor was, uh the calcium was low or high it was.

DOCTOR X717
High.

SECOND PERSON X717
High the phosphorus was low or everything was off balance.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
So how long does it last?

DOCTOR X717
Well it's gonna last indefinitely um because of the cancer because the cancer is still there.

SECOND PERSON X717
No I'm talking about him being able to eat.  He wasn't doing nothing till he came in here that's why I insisted on coming back here even though Hospice wanted him in the house.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
He wasn't making any progress until he came here and had the.

DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Do you know what I'm saying I think there?

DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Does that make sense?

DOCTOR X717
Well we'll check the labs and see if everything's okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.  Can he go back to where he was in December?

DOCTOR X717
Well you know eventually we would expect that because the cancer is progressing he's not being treated so we would expect for that to happen.  The question is we don't know how long that will take for that to happen cause no one can know.  No cancer doctors, nobody can know.

SECOND PERSON X717
Well he wasn't eating until he came here.

DOCTOR X717
But now he's eating again right?

PATIENT X717
I don't gain no weight now.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah, well why can't you @@@ terrible to me.

PATIENT X717
That's all the exam, what we talking about now, what we gonna do about the pain pills, about the pain?

DOCTOR X717
Let me talk with my boss okay and we'll figure it out.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh do you want to look.  You see how @@@ or something.

DOCTOR X717
I'll talk to the boss and be back.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh you want this to go all the way down again?

DOCTOR X717
Yeah because now his potassium is low it looks like.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh it is hmm.

PATIENT X717
What's that now?

SECOND PERSON X717
I don't know nothing about it, I just put the book down I was trying to read, I stopped trying to be his doctor, I'm just @@@ so I don't know.  I mean to me I don't know why you think Hospice is so hot.  You don't have a doctor when you have Hospice.  All of a sudden somebody's coming and giving you medicine but if they came in, so there's no trial stuff that he can get into no, you don't know.

DOCTOR X717
No. That's what, that's what @@@ assessment Oncology Department back like in August.

SECOND PERSON X717
Well we had, August 30th, I asked for a follow-up and they said he didn't need one so then the last hospitalization here at the VA I asked, I asked to speak with Oncology so I'm coming here this Thursday.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm going to Oncology; this is because I asked for this.  I want to find out if it's something that they could do.  Cause I don't hold the Hospice philosophy.  Do you hear what I'm saying?

DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Of comfort palliative care, I'm still hoping for a stage V which would offer something that ya'll have not been able to offer but whatever ya'll done for him in December I want to do over.  They told me to make sure I give the magnesium and the phosphorus so that's keeping his appetite up and everything, you don't know?

DOCTOR X717
Yeah it sometimes can really affect that I mean it just keeps, it just keeps it replenished you know in the setting of not eating.  If he's eating better, let me talk to my boss and we'll see what we can do.  We can check his labs and things like that and see what we find.  I mean give him something for the constipation, get him something better for pain.

SECOND PERSON X717
Hmm.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.  

SECOND PERSON X717
What do you think the problem is?

PATIENT X717
But I got uh a suppositories that they sent me.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X717
What's that?

SECOND PERSON X717
Suppositories.

DOCTOR X717
Suppositories okay.

PATIENT X717
We have them, @@@ and it's actually every day, every day, it doesn't and I ain't got no power to pool my urine, my bowel movement out.  The only thing to do it is just.

DOCTOR X717
We can give you something stronger definitely.

SECOND PERSON X717
Well what could you do for the hernia, you don't know?

DOCTOR X717
For the hernia the only thing that we could do right now is pain control, trying to get the pain under better control and to stimulate the bowel movements.

SECOND PERSON X717
They can't do no research or nothing?

DOCTOR X717
I mean we can refer to Surgery but because of all these other illnesses I seriously doubt if they would do surgery on him.

SECOND PERSON X717
They wouldn't do a CT scan or anything like that?

DOCTOR X717
They wouldn't do it because, what would they do if they find something.  If you have a hernia they're not going to do a surgery because he's a palliative patient.

SECOND PERSON X717
Alright.

DOCTOR X717
Does that make sense?  Do you understand why?

SECOND PERSON X717
I understand.

PATIENT X717
Yeah, yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah I understand.  Actually @@@.

PATIENT X717
Yeah why is that, I mean why?

DOCTOR X717
Because of the risk of doing a surgery in you, which is also going on in your body, the complication rate would be too high.  But if you want we can send you to the surgeons to talk with them about it if that's what you want.

SECOND PERSON X717
He's a high risk?

DOCTOR X717
Yes because of his cancer.

PATIENT X717
High risk of what?

DOCTOR X717
For the complications of @@@.

PATIENT X717
@@@ or something?

DOCTOR X717
No that if they try to repair the hernia that you would end up being in the hospital on a ventilator for the rest of your life basically.  Just because of the hernia which would really drastically um, it would basically drastically mess up in um quality of life.

PATIENT X717
You can't give me, so the doctor say you give me @@@ pills then.

SECOND PERSON X717
So he his abdominal discomfort and pain, but he has not complained of chest pain.  Oh we forgot to tell him, he has a cough now, a productive cough.

DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And he has green sputum that he's coughing up.

DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Is that from the lungs?

DOCTOR X717
Probably.  It's coming from the lung cancer.

SECOND PERSON X717
He's never had that before.

DOCTOR X717
I mean it's probably from the worsening, from the lung cancer taking its course.

SECOND PERSON X717
But his um oxygen stuff is.

DOCTOR X717
He's doing okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
It's okay but he's very confused, gets very anxious and if ya'll can't do nothing, I think @@@.

DOCTOR X717
Let me talk to my boss and then I'll come back and see what she thinks okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Alright.

DOCTOR X717
I'll ask her and see what she thinks okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.

DOCTOR X717
I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:12  DOCTOR IN:  62:45)

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Hi there.  Hi PATIENT how are you?

PATIENT X717
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Hi PATIENT I'm DOCTOR.  I don't think we've met before.  I'm one of the medicine doctors here.  I'm working with DOCTOR and he, I went over the medical records with him um a little bit so I kind of have been a little more familiarized with um PATIENT's health condition.  I know that a lot of things have been concerning you, one being he's in a lot of pain from the hernia um or what seems to be a hernia and you're just wanting follow up from his recent hospitalization is that right?
SECOND PERSON X717
Uh somewhat.

PATIENT X717
Yes, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay so when you, I know that Oncology and you know different services have talked to you both about Hospice.  What does Hospice mean for you?  Cause you know I want to know what exactly are the appropriate management points we need to focus on.  Some people are really only focused on being comfortable at home.  Other people want more done.  So what are, what did you all discuss with your Oncology doctors about Hospice?

SECOND PERSON X717
Well I do what she wants to.

PATIENT X717
Yeah I gave the same uh, @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
And I noticed that you have diabetes or blood pressure, those things have all been stopped, really it's just pain medicine right now.

PATIENT X717
Yeah, I have this thing.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
That's really causing you a lot of pain?

PATIENT X717
Yeah I eat alright; it's just that I was doing fine, this right here.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

PATIENT X717
This here, this is going back and forth, back and forth, as long as it's back and forth and pain.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah let me see here.

PATIENT X717
Feel it?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah right in here.

PATIENT X717
Hurts.  Along with this, right there yeah @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Have you had recent imaging of his abdomen?  So yeah the question would be the only way to repair those, if it is in fact a hernia which it appears to be, is the surgical approach.  I don't know that they're gonna want to do anything surgically um.

SECOND PERSON X717
What @@@?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Huh?

SECOND PERSON X717
What @@@?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I don't know.  I mean it could just be pain medication cause right now.

SECOND PERSON X717
When you say they you know I want you to identify they.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Anybody, anyone, I don't know that anyone would operate because he's a very high risk um of not doing well.

SECOND PERSON X717
What would make him be um high risk?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Being a stage IV cancer patient he's a high risk.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.  What I want to ask you is that he's very, very uncomfortable.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Oh yeah, I want you to ask.

SECOND PERSON X717
He can express himself.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Because he's the patient and I can't express his subjective feelings.  Now I can tell you what I think.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
As his caretaker.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And his wife and living with him during his whole illness.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
No I understand, I know what you mean.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh illness.  No I'm gonna tell you what I think.  I think that his pain is not controlled.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
I think that um.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Hold on second, let me just go up here, I'm sorry I'm looking; I'm just to read and mostly to understand.

SECOND PERSON X717
See when he left the hospital he did not have uh this problem that he's got now so would you think it would be reasonable for him to have another scan?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
He's probably gonna need some kind of imaging if this is new.

SECOND PERSON X717
This is new; this is what I'm trying to tell you.  While he was hospitalized on December 25th to January the 2nd or something.  I think he was here until January 2nd, uh he did not have a problem that I am and that he is expressing you.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
With the left belly pain.

SECOND PERSON X717
Right.  Lower abdominal pain.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
He checked, he didn't have the hernia.  It wasn't as large and protruding as it is now.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Or I would've said something and he would've said something.  I try to allow him to, he's the patient, I'm just somebody that's in the family.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm just his wife.  I don't have his pain, that's why I want him to express himself.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Usually the patients are pretty good @@@.  I'm sorry I clicked it off.

SECOND PERSON X717
So I'll stop talking so ya'll.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Well you know, it sounds like, when did you last see your cancer doctors I'm curious because the last note I could find was August.  Has it been that long?

SECOND PERSON X717
And while we were in the hospital, the last time we saw Oncology cancer people.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Was August 30, 2011.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
We had one appointment, we talked to someone that pulled up the computer and told us the results.  Can you hear me with all that rattling?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
No I can hear you, go ahead I'm listening.

SECOND PERSON X717
So on August the 30th she didn't examine my husband.  All that she did was told him the results.  She had never seen him before.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
The PET scan.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
That was done at VA xxx xxx xxx.  She told him the results of the PET scan, where the cancer, how it was staged and how it had mets spread and to what areas of the body as to what, where the bones and so with that and I asked could I have a follow-up appointment with Surgery and she said no.  I asked if we'd have chemotherapy and she said no.  I asked if we'd have radiation therapy.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
And she said no and then my husband asked her.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Cause it didn't help yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
My husband asked her if he could have surgery in terms of removing the tumor and she said it was @@@ it was located so close to his heart that.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh it would be very dangerous.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah I saw that.

SECOND PERSON X717
And then he asked her again.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm trying to tell you what happened.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.  I have read all of this already yeah.  I did read it yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay I'm trying to tell you what happened.  He asked her again how we don't understand.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
Could they surgically remove the um tumor.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And she said that uh they couldn't because of the location of the tumor.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Right uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
So then while he was hospitalized all they did for so long, while he was here from December 25th to January 2nd, I asked them if we could talk with Oncology.  I didn't know if we could get involved with some trial studies, medicine or anything.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And uh they said that they weren't because of the holidays able to get an appointment but once he was discharged they would try to get an appointment.  When they gave him an appointment it was a snow storm @@@ to go on a Thursday.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON X717
And I couldn't take my husband out in a snowstorm.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
So I made another appointment for this week which is Thursday.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh at to see Oncology, I don't know.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So you have one on Thursday?

SECOND PERSON X717
I have an appointment at 8:45 for Oncology that I made for this week but I don't know what they'll be able to do.  If they don't examine him I'll be very irate.



SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I will be very upset if they don't even examine him.  What I don't like, can I say this, I hate for people to just conclude.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
I hate waiting, I hate for people to just, can I finish, give up and that's what I can feel.  xxx xxx comes into your home, the reason why I don't like their philosophy, they're coming in in terms of treating the symptoms.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
In terms of saying well we don't need it yet.  So far they have not been able to control the pain.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And make PATIENT, my husband, comfortable.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.  Are you finished or do you still have something you want to tell me?

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah I want to tell you that uh he's so thin, he's had such tremendous weight loss that I was wondering is it possible for them to give him some type of donut or something?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Right, well I mean I guess it'll come from Hospice, I don't know if it'll come from the VA Hospice.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
This donut cause he's so, he started getting a decubitus.  It was just, it wasn't even 1 centimeter, it was like half of a centimeter or something.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Does he have one now?  A decubitus?

SECOND PERSON X717
On his coccyx area.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
But what happens that, so just like a pin breaks.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
We'll look at it.

SECOND PERSON X717
And uh they, they put a dressing to it before he left the hospital and I don't know if it's showing up on the computer now and so but if you have these donuts or stuff would that help?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Probably not.

SECOND PERSON X717
No.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
The donuts don't help decubitus ulcers.  We'll take a look at it.

SECOND PERSON X717
Maybe it'll help in the wheelchair.

PATIENT X717
It might not do anything @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
We'll look at it and then I'll let you know what I think okay.  But to address the initial part of your conversation, so what I estimate and again we don't know all the in's and out's of what's going on here, having just met your husband but from what I saw being able to know the source of it.

SECOND PERSON X717
You feel that.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
From what I was able to, what's going on with you @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
I've got water but I.  Here honey, you want this for your medicine, come on honey.

PATIENT X717
And my throat @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Honey I can't do this now, that's too hard.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
@@@.

PATIENT X717
I mean it's nothing.

SECOND PERSON X717
I don't @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
@@@.

PATIENT X717
I can't even get no @@@ no.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Come on take some water.

PATIENT X717
Get it out of here.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Don't call her @@@.

PATIENT X717
I don't see no privacy.

(First and second doctors discuss patient between them)

SECOND PERSON X717
Here, here we go.  Okay you've got it.  Thank you very much.  Sorry @@@ bad you know.  I'll fix it.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay so essentially I think that what's going on here is that you're clearly frustrated cause you feel like people aren't properly um addressing all of the concerns that you have.  All of the pain that your husband's having.  

SECOND PERSON X717
That's not true, that's not true okay.  You're not frustrating me.  First of all I think they're doing everything.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm very pleased and satisfied with @@@ thought that they have not been able to control.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
The pain, they've tried everything.  I'm not frustrated about anything.  I'm just haven't gave up.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
No one can make me give up.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Let me say this okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Go ahead.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Because otherwise we're probably not gonna make much progress here.  I understand that this is a very, this is a very difficult time and it's a very difficult situation.  It sounds like, from Oncology's perspective, they know that just from all of the data they have and from evaluating your husband they know from their estimation, their experience that there is nothing more that they feel they can do.  Now if he has to see them again and re-address that issue I think that's a good idea and it sounds like you already have that plan so that's one thing.  I could not speak more on that.  I'm not a cancer doctor.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I don't have an educated opinion about that beyond what it appears is this is a non-surgical situation um and you know if they think he's too weak for chemo or there's no appropriate trials out there they're the best ones to speak to that.  Now as far as pain goes yeah, if he's not getting adequate pain control then we need to keep working on that.  Um he's got a palliative doctor who's seeing him for pain control, is that correct or not?

SECOND PERSON X717
We don't have coverage for that.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay who prescribed his pain medicines right now?

SECOND PERSON X717
Um VA did and then Hospice.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.  So we probably.

SECOND PERSON X717
Is that the palliative doctor, what's the?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
(Doctor asks the first doctor to look something up in the computer)

SECOND PERSON X717
So is that the doctor from the VA or is it the doctor from Hospice I'm @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
xxx xxx.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh it is.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Um let's, we're looking.

SECOND PERSON X717
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
(Doctors are checking the computer and discussing this between them)  See if we have, do you know the name of the person prescribing the pain medicine the?

SECOND PERSON X717
I can spell his name.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Would that help?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Um it might, who?

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh, uh before he came into the hospital uh the Hospice doctor, his name was DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Is that, I think it's something like that.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Because really what we'd have to do, just so that we.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm not sure.  I never saw him or talked to him.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
The only person I've ever seen is the uh the nurse, you know manager.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
And who's that?

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh his nurse manager her name is NAME.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.  So maybe, what, the best thing we could probably do is to try to get a hold of the people who are actually prescribing the pain medicines right now; I'll let them know we need to make some adjustments.  We could @@@ entering them in but we probably need to work with you know, have a discussion with them about it and let them know that he's not getting adequate pain control.  Now let me be specific in terms of understanding how he's not getting adequate control.  PATIENT are you ever at a point where you're feeling like your pain is being well controlled or do you always have pain?

PATIENT X717
Um what they doing is they giving these.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X717
And it cuts me out; it cuts me off two hours.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So you have a two hour period where before you can take it again you've got pain?

PATIENT X717
I got pain.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay so before that two hours is over you're in pain.

PATIENT X717
Less than the two hours.
SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

PATIENT X717
When it come I have some pain.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

PATIENT X717
But.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

PATIENT X717
It's kind of rough on it and we have to call, whoever we got to call.  I'm not going.

SECOND PERSON X717
They say @@@.

PATIENT X717
Pay no mind.

SECOND PERSON X717
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
@@@.  Well this said you can take it every two hours.

PATIENT X717
That's all I said, but two hours is too long.

SECOND PERSON X717
That didn't come from Hospice that came from VA.

PATIENT X717
VA gave me that.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
But you can take three tablets every two hours then we can.

PATIENT X717
Right @@@ twice you know I mean I call in for the patches and all of this is higher than what the VA is giving me.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
No uh we don't mind.  You can get it through the VA.

PATIENT X717
I know you see but she is saying, when she calls the VA it's gonna be more.  I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Right now we're trying to figure out what's gonna give you pain relief so like.

SECOND PERSON X717
The VA, the VA gave him.

PATIENT X717
VA right here.

SECOND PERSON X717
The Dilaudid.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
He was on Vicodin then something came in here @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So how are we doing on the Dilaudid, along with the Fentanyl patch?

PATIENT X717
Fine, fine.

SECOND PERSON X717
Fine but, but he's doing okay but he has an anxiety problem and VA has said discontinue Ativan, we had to get the Ativan back from his Hospice um.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
So now he's on Zyprexa and Ativan.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay but now we're going off on a tangent.  Let's focus on the pain first and then we can talk about another topic.  The pain is controlled with the Fentanyl patch and the Dilaudid that he's getting through the VA yes?

SECOND PERSON X717
PATIENT?  Cause I can't feel your pain.

PATIENT X717
All I know is what happenings here.

SECOND PERSON X717
For 45 minutes, that's what he's saying.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
There's only @@@ it lasts about 45 minutes.

SECOND PERSON X717
45 minutes so is that controlled I don't know.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So once he takes this for 45 minutes he's good and then it starts again.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
With just Dilaudid the two pills.

SECOND PERSON X717
Every two hours so if that 45 minutes or maybe it might be a little longer, maybe it's controlled for a hour but what I was saying to you is he has to have an anxiety pill.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
More than once a day but VA was the one that gave him that anxiety medicine but instead of once a day we had to give it twice.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
The Zyprexa?

SECOND PERSON X717
Zyprexa or he becomes very anxious.  I thought that it was very important for you to know.  He's anxious because of his pain.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.  I don't know, can you look up.

SECOND PERSON X717
So is it possible to take it twice a day?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
The Zyprexa, let me look it up, I honestly couldn't tell you.  It's not a medication I really prescribe.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
It's fine every 12 hours.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
The Zyprexa, it says you can take it twice a day, the way it's written here.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay well okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So that should be okay.  Now as far as the Dilaudid, now a half-life should be from one to two hours so theoretically.

SECOND PERSON X717
It's okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I'm wondering if we could change this to one to two hours.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Um.  (Doctor asks first doctor to look something up on the computer and they discuss patient)  So we're gonna look it up and I'll see if we can change it but really it's a discussion that needs to be had with whoever's controlling his pain but since I don't know how to get a hold of that person we can at least try to get you enough before they're gonna come, when do they come back to you normally?

SECOND PERSON X717
Um they come, uh they come and see us every.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Two weeks?

SECOND PERSON X717
No every, uh twice a week.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Oh okay so when did you last see them?

PATIENT X717
Last Friday so they supposed to be Tuesday but we had to come down here on appointment.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay so they probably.

PATIENT X717
And Fridays, Tuesday and Fridays.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
And how do you contact them?

SECOND PERSON X717
They came last Tuesday; Friday they did not come she called though.  But they're in contact.  I don't have no problem with them.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
And you don't have a number?  No, no, I know.  DOCTOR, I need an actual number we can contact them.  Do you have a way?

SECOND PERSON X717
If you want to.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Oh, they have a number.

SECOND PERSON X717
I can answer you, NUMBER.  I'm giving the direct number to my nurse manager.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
NUMBER.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay hold on, this pen is not working.

SECOND PERSON X717
Just write it down, NUMBER.  The nurse manager's name is NAME.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay I will call them.

SECOND PERSON X717
That's I only have one nurse, it's the nurse manager.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So these people okay why don't we just talk to them.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So then we'll talk to them about the hernia too because really I don't know that anyone's gonna feel like it's a good idea for him being weak and having this stage of cancer cause the only way to treat a hernia like this is surgically.  So um.

SECOND PERSON X717
They can't reduce no other kind of way?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
No there's no other way to, I mean it reduces on it's own but the only way to keep it gone is doing surgery.

SECOND PERSON X717
And do you know why it came, I mean this hernia.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Um you know he could have.  Has he ever had surgery, it looks like he had surgery on his abdomen before.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yes, July of 2011.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Last year.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So wherever he had surgery before that part of the abdomen is probably a little weaker and thinner so it creates an area where it's vulnerable for other organs like bowels to poke through.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So.

SECOND PERSON X717
Wearing a belly band or something that don't help I mean wearing an um.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I don't know that it's gonna make a huge difference here because it's not that big but it's clearly its causing pain so let me talk to the Hospice nurse too.  I don't mind referring him to Surgery to see what they have to say.  I just don't know what they're gonna offer him so I don't mind you talking to them and then they can tell you what they think um I just, by my estimation I'm not sure that they would feel it was safe for him to go through a surgery that's not a life-saving type surgery for a hernia you know so we wouldn't want to possibly do more harm than good for something that wasn't absolutely necessary.  Now if they look at it as well, keeping him comfortable is what we're trying to do and he's not comfortable maybe they'd be willing to, I honestly don't know so we can put in the referral and find out.

SECOND PERSON X717
With lung cancer are you supposed to, my question to you, have abdominal pain?  He's been having abdominal pain for six months.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
From the hernia?

SECOND PERSON X717
Right where's he's telling you now.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah from the hernia.  This isn't the cancer this is the hernia.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay well that's where his pain is.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Right.

SECOND PERSON X717
And nothing in his chest.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
But what I'm saying is.

SECOND PERSON X717
So that's not from the cancer it's from the hernia.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
No it's from the hernia.  Where he's pointing to is the hernia.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay so let's just go on and talk to the security guy or let me look at your backside first okay.  You know your wife told me you had that ulcer.  Do you mind if I look at it?  I'm gonna just grab some gloves first okay.  Let me squeeze past you here.

PATIENT X717
Now look at what, what are you looking at?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Um.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yes, that's alright, no skin breakdown.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
No skin breakdown.  Like stage 1, just a little erythema?

SECOND PERSON X717
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So usually how we dress those is just a transparent dressing and then.

SECOND PERSON X717
Well when he was in the hospital they, he was here in the VA a month ago, they was putting a dressing on it and he was bleeding and the skin had broke down so maybe.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
@@@ he's good.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay how we usually either prevent further @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Cover the skin with.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah what we would probably do is recommend things like a hospital type bed.  He probably needs to have one of those.  Frequent turning, you know good nutrition, all those things.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Um because otherwise you know obviously if he's running down a lot he's at risk for developing you know.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh I see.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Further ones or getting this one to advance.  So I mean we could at least put in a referral.

SECOND PERSON X717
Uh you know we didn't come today because of his pain we're just saying that he's uncomfortable.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I understand.

SECOND PERSON X717
Because of the um, but he's been having this, he's been having, this is what I'm asking you.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
I guess people don't listen.  He's been like this for what six months.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Right.

SECOND PERSON X717
So if it's not from the cancer.

PATIENT X717
Now why don't you let her talk?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Like I said it's from the hernia.

PATIENT X717
Now that's all, I just want you to call her since my medication, I don't know if these people can give me some.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So we're gonna refer you to a doctor for your hernia.

PATIENT X717
@@@ anything you can do about the hernia.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I believe this is the hernia causing the pain, not the cancer.

PATIENT X717
No it ain't the cancer, if it would the other side would be.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah.

PATIENT X717
No it's not the cancer.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
So he does not have any cancer in his abdomen from what we were able to see so this is not the cancer causing this pain.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh he gave us NicoDerm patches.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yes.

SECOND PERSON X717
She said that they didn't provide them, the VA gave it to them so when we came over here the nurse I talked to her twice today, she said make sure that we ask for the NicoDerm.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Yeah we can't write for those, we'll have to refer him cause they won't let us write for those.

SECOND PERSON X717
But they gave it to us when he left the hospital.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I understand they can in the hospital but they can't on an outpatient basis.  It's just the VA @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay can I say something to you, cause I see you didn't hear me.  When he left here on discharge they gave him NicoDerm.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I understand that.  I cannot write for it as the outpatient doctor.  They can do that as an inpatient doctor.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I understood what you said.

SECOND PERSON X717
The Lidoderm either?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
The Lidoderm we also cannot do.  So we can try to find out how to get them, that's what we're gonna do.

SECOND PERSON X717
Are you angry?

SECOND DOCTOR X717
No I'm not angry but I just, you're telling me that I'm not listening but I've heard everything you've said.  I just want you to realize that I still can't do it.  All I can do is try to find out how we can facilitate fully and that's what we're gonna do.

SECOND PERSON X717
The nurse is the one that gave me these directions; I talked to her twice this morning.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Sure.

SECOND PERSON X717
She told me to ask for the NicoDerm.  She told me to ask for the Lidoderm.  She told me to ask for um all the medicine.  Everything I'm saying.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I got directed from the Hospice nurse.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Okay.

PATIENT X717
They're just watching over me, @@@ giving it back.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
I know they @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay. The nurse um told me to ask for this.

SECOND DOCTOR X717
Sure I understand.

PATIENT X717
I'm ready to go, I understand.

SECOND PERSON X717
Why are you ready to go?

PATIENT X717
Cause I'm hurting, man I been hurting, let's just go.

SECOND PERSON X717
But you just took @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X717

SECOND PERSON X717
He just took the medicine.  @@@ at one time.  

FIRST DOCTOR X717
It should kick in @@@, it should kick in.  @@@.  

SECOND DOCTOR X717
He's taken the medicine twice since he's been here.  I really don't want @@@.

PATIENT X717
Almost 12 o'clock.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah.

PATIENT X717
I'll wait till 1 o'clock.

SECOND PERSON X717
Okay.

PATIENT X717
2 o'clock is an hour.

SECOND PERSON X717
@@@.

PATIENT X717
2 o'clock is two.

SECOND PERSON X717
And you took two, well that's four pills he's taken since he's been here right?  Two before you left home, that's six pills, so that's why you gonna change it to every one to two hours.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Yeah.  Uh we're gonna put that in.

PATIENT X717
Hours.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
@@@ doing.

PATIENT X717
Two uh.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
So let's give them a call to see if we can find out what they've been doing and then um.

SECOND PERSON X717
They call the VA.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
But they're gonna be, also be giving um, we don't want to be giving; we want to find out so we're not all giving a bunch of different regimens.  We want to have one regimen for him.  Okay we're giving you one thing and they're giving something else.

SECOND PERSON X717
I see.  When um when he was discharged I gave the nurse the computer sheet that they give you when you leave the hospital.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
And she followed everything that um, she was the one that told the VA had wrote down for me cause he was on Vicodin so the VA changed it to Dilaudid, not Hospice.  Only thing that we have changed was he needs his Ativan or he can't function.  He has to have that.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
So how come, how come they're not prescribing it at home then?

SECOND PERSON X717
They are.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
So they are prescribing it, so he doesn't need that cause you guys have it right?

SECOND PERSON X717
We have the Ativan.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Okay so you don't need the Ativan.

SECOND PERSON X717
No.  The VA had said discontinue the Ativan cause they were giving Zyprexa but he has to take the Zyprexa and the Ativan so I don't give this other Seroquel because I'm giving Ativan you know good with some food and I'm giving Zyprexa so I have not gave the Seroquel.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
But that's what I was trying to tell her.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
That's because you don't want to over medicate him or just so you can have it @@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
I have never gave all of it.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
You've never tried to give all of them?

SECOND PERSON X717
No, no.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
@@@.

SECOND PERSON X717
Well because one is an anti-psychotic and one is what anti-anxiety.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Yes.  One is anti-psychotic and one is anti-anxiolytic.  

SECOND PERSON X717
The Zyprexa is the anti-psychotic.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Right.

SECOND PERSON X717
The Seroquel is anti-psychotic right?  It's for PTSD, his PTSD.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Right, right.

SECOND PERSON X717
That's what the Seroquel is for and the Zyprexa is just given for anti-psychotic.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
It's usually given for hypersomnia.

SECOND PERSON X717
Insomnia.  But he takes it twice a day with the Ativan together.  When I give him one I give the other.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Hmm. Alright so we'll have the labs checked.  You can go over to the Laboratory after this.

SECOND PERSON X717
Yeah I came for the visit so I just wanted his electrolytes @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
So I'll be back down.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Of course and in terms of the um the constipation, is he taking the Docusate or is he out of that?

SECOND PERSON X717
He's got all of his, he's got the suppositories and what he don't have, she told me to write everything down so we can talk about it, he don't have the, I'm not frustrated about anything.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I just didn't want him to go; he was in bad shape when he came in here on Christmas.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I didn't want him to get back like that again um.  He's taking the um, he needs the patch for smoking NicoDerm, he needs the Lidoderm patch.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
So the Lidoderm patch I don't see in here so we have to call them to find out what's going on with that.

SECOND PERSON X717
Right and um he needs the um Fentanyl patch and you were saying to and then increase it to 100 instead of 50 or just wait @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
She's gonna manage the pain stuff and she's calling over to the nurse that you're talking about.  So she's gonna take care of that.

SECOND PERSON X717
That's been his nurse for the last five months so.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
We still have a lot of medicines so, all his medicines this nurse didn't prescribe VA prescribed so um but we been coming here so much, we came in here.  I'm glad ya'll are gonna do the labs to see where he is, so his calcium won't be real high or low or whatever and he doesn't get real sick like he was Christmas.  I spent Christmas at VA Hospital and New Year's.  I was here for nine days so.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON X717
I don't want him to get back in that shape if they could stretch it.  I mean would the VA Hospital allow him to get the IV therapy or they don't do that?

FIRST DOCTOR X717
For what though?

SECOND PERSON X717
His electrolyte imbalance.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Well we don't know what his electrolytes are.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm saying if he became imbalanced like he was Christmas would they put him in the hospital here.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Um if it was bad enough yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Cause he was real bad when he um came in here Christmas.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Oh if it was bad enough they would just put him in.  

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh he can't sit up too long like he just, he'll get real tired.  That's why he's laying down now he gets real tired.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Okay.

SECOND PERSON X717
Real easy.  Is it anemia or something?  I mean if it could.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
It could be from fatigue from the cancer itself, that happens.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
It makes him tired.

SECOND PERSON X717
Oh the cancer makes him tired.

FIRST DOCTOR X717
It can yeah.

SECOND PERSON X717
Do you think I'm frustrated because I'm asking questions?  Is it not allowed to ask questions?

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Oh no, you can ask questions I mean that's fine.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm not trying to, I'm not frustrated about anything, I'm just trying to find out uh what you all can do, what I can do for my husband, the patient.  You know is there something wrong with that?

FIRST DOCTOR X717
No.  

SECOND PERSON X717
But she said I was frustrated.  I am not frustrated.  I'm just trying to find out is there something I can do.  I got 17 grandkids and I'll be asking are you hungry, if you say you don't want eggs then I'll ask them do you want waffles or does you want cold cereal or you want orange juice or do you want nothing and so that's saying something.  I'm doing the same thing here I'm asking what can we do as a team to trying to work for the patient, PATIENT.  That's the only thing I'm asking, is that allowed?

FIRST DOCTOR X717
Of course it's allowed, of course it's allowed.

SECOND PERSON X717
I'm just not gonna hammock, she can't make me give a hammock under her breath and just I had a patient once cause I worked in health care.

FIRST DOCTOR X717

SECOND PERSON X717
Cause they had gave this patient up and they had said oh, you know but I was sensitive.  You know when you work 11 to 7 it look like you're in a different rest, we never get enough rest.  But I was a supervisor so I had to make rounds and we gave him the hot chocolate and we had fed this patient off and on @@@.  This patient happily told the doctor @@@ and he said it was alright to.

FIRST DOCTOR X717

FIRST DOCTOR X717
I can't even; it's all I'm locked out right now because she's putting in the orders.  So if you guys want to hang out I can try to log back in once the pharmacist is out of the system and you can possibly get the medication today.

DOCTOR X71
PATIENT?

PATIENT X71
Yes sir.

DOCTOR X71
Right this way.

PATIENT X71
Thank you.  

SECOND PERSON X71
@@@

PATIENT X71
Yes.

DOCTOR X71
How are you today?

PATIENT X71
Good.  How are you doctor?

DOCTOR X71
Good to see you, nice to see you here.

PATIENT X71
Nice to see you, thank you.

DOCTOR X71
On your right, hi there.

PATIENT X71
On the right?

DOCTOR X71
Yes.  Alright I think we've got room for both of you.  There and right there.

SECOND PERSON X71
Okay.

DOCTOR X71
Great so let's see 143/72, pretty good.

PATIENT X71
That's great.

DOCTOR X71
Yeah.  Alright, how are things going?

PATIENT X71
Well doctor, I have to tell you that uh you apparently found a magic pill.

DOCTOR X71
Did I really?

PATIENT X71
Yes.  I'm feeling much better these days.

DOCTOR X71
Good.

PATIENT X71
And I've eliminated some of the problems that we talked to about in our previous meeting.

SECOND PERSON X71
Except for me.

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter).

PATIENT X71
And when you figure that one out.

DOCTOR X71
Better she said it than you.

PATIENT X71
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X71
Um so feeling pretty good.

PATIENT X71
Yes, believe it or not.

DOCTOR X71
How are the blood pressures doing?

PATIENT X71
The blood pressures are doing pretty good uh.  I would have to tell you that from time to time I do get a spike uh when the lady of the house breaks something or something along those lines.

SECOND PERSON X71
I do that to keep him busy and healthy.

PATIENT X71
Uh but behind like.

DOCTOR X71
That gives him something to do huh.

SECOND PERSON X71
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT X71
I wish you hadn't said that.

SECOND PERSON X71
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter)  So when you check it at home, what's the range?

PATIENT X71
The range will be probably in the uh mid 140s.  One day it hit 96, I don't know.

DOCTOR X71
196?

PATIENT X71
No, no, 96.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.

PATIENT X71
And I'm not sure why that happened.  I hate to speculate on that possibility but uh I have to tell you about it in case it's something that.

DOCTOR X71
You mean the bottom number was 96.

PATIENT X71
No the first number was 96.

DOCTOR X71
Alright.  So usually it's in the 140s?

PATIENT X71
140s, 130s.

DOCTOR X71
Over?

PATIENT X71
Uh it'll be 69, 76, sometimes it's 69, sometimes it's 76 and sometimes it's even less.  There seems to be a variable.  It varies.  There doesn't seem to be any consistency.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.

PATIENT X71
And I think we discussed that earlier, I think probably the reason is there's something in the background that is just causing it.  

DOCTOR X71
Are you having any problems uh with an irregular heartbeat, feeling your heart skipping, racing, fluttering, any of that stuff?

PATIENT X71
Not really no.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.  Are you having lightheadedness, dizziness?

PATIENT X71
Not anymore.  You seemed to correct that with the adjustment in the medications.

DOCTOR X71
Good.  Chest pain?

PATIENT X71
None.

DOCTOR X71
Are you having trouble with your breathing, filling up with fluid um, swelling in the feet?

PATIENT X71
No the swelling has gone away as a matter of fact.

DOCTOR X71
Good.  Alright and uh let's see how are we doing with the uh diabetes?

PATIENT X71
The diabetes, like the heart, vacillates.  Sometimes it spikes uh I'm assuming if I engage in some social activities uh every once in a while um, maybe I forget or maybe I do something that I'm not supposed to, it'll spike and uh most of the time it's been under control.  When I say under control uh, it's in, it'll go anywhere from um 130, to once in a while it'll go to 169 and then there are times when it goes below 100.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.  Alright.  Do you check it every day or?

PATIENT X71
No you suggested that I do it every couple of days.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.

PATIENT X71
Uh excuse me; I thought it was you that suggested I did that.

DOCTOR X71
@@@.  You really don't need to be doing it every day.

PATIENT X71
According to the um the prescriptions that I receive, the instruction was every couple of days.  Maybe not in those terms but that's my conclusion.

DOCTOR X71
Let's see, I think it's been a while since we've done some blood work on you huh.  It's been a little bit uh.

PATIENT X71
I figured it was because it wasn't blue; you didn't need to take it anymore.

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter).  We may need to get an idea of like how the blood sugars have been and how, to make sure the cholesterol is still under good control and that sort of thing and uh.  Let's see, I think the last time you were here we actually ordered a couple blood tests, yeah.

PATIENT X71
Last time?

DOCTOR X71
Yeah.

PATIENT X71
No you didn't order any blood tests.  I haven't received anything.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.

PATIENT X71
Or I wasn't.

DOCTOR X71
They're in there but uh I don't know, I guess they didn't let you know so.  How's your urinating?

PATIENT X71
That sometimes is a problem.

DOCTOR X71
How often are you waking up at night?

PATIENT X71
Sometimes when I first go to bed about uh the first hour or so, I have to relieve myself and then maybe another hour and then usually it goes from 2-3 hours.  During the daytime I don't seem to have as much problem.  I try to watch my intake.  I don't know if it's my intake or, if I.  I've avoided carbonated beverages.  Carbonated beverages seem to aggravate it.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.  We switched up to this medicine Flomax.

PATIENT X71
What's Flomax, I don't remember that?

DOCTOR X71
We put you on it for urinate.

PATIENT X71
Yeah but it's called something else I think.

DOCTOR X71
Tamsulosin?

PATIENT X71
Say again.

DOCTOR X71
Tamsulosin?

PATIENT X71
Yes.

DOCTOR X71
Yeah.

PATIENT X71
Yes.

DOCTOR X71
Is that one working any better?

PATIENT X71
No I wouldn't say its working any better.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.  

PATIENT X71
I think I was on uh terazosin ahead of that.

DOCTOR X71
Yeah we switched it and you're not noticing much of an improvement?

PATIENT X71
No.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.  Hmm.

PATIENT X71
Should that be addressed?

DOCTOR X71
Um.  Well we already have you on two pills you know to help with your urinating.

PATIENT X71
Finasteride and

DOCTOR X71
Yeah.  So we're definitely addressing it.  I just, I don't know if there is much else that we can do beyond what we're doing.  If it's a big problem you know we could send you to Urology and uh you know they could discuss some other things that they're, but I mean now we're probably talking more about like a procedure or something to uh so it would have to be something that's really bothering you before we went down that road.  

PATIENT X71
Well.

DOCTOR X71
If you can live with it, then I'd probably recommend just living with it.

PATIENT X71
Yeah, for once you get to be 39 years old, you don't want to.

SECOND PATIENT X71
Once or twice a night.

PATIENT X71
Go too far.

DOCTOR X71
Yes and uh, the last time you said that you were feeling tired all the time.

PATIENT X71
Well, I haven't had that experience.  Is that because of the change in medication or how do you address that?

DOCTOR X71
Uh.  It may be.  I mean if you're feeling better than.

PATIENT X71
I am feeling better.

DOCTOR X71
You may be getting better.  Uh the last time I thought it may have had to do with you waking up so much at night to urinate and that's what it was, thought you probably want to try uh.

PATIENT X71
He had a pizza in his hand.

DOCTOR X71
Did he?

SECOND PERSON X71
(Laughter)

PATIENT X71
Wasn't that a pizza?

SECOND PERSON X71
No, stop it.

PATIENT X71
The Budweiser guys.

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter) And uh what about uh shots and all these things?

PATIENT X71
Um doctor I think, I don't expect you to remember but uh.

DOCTOR X71
I know you aren't interested.

PATIENT X71
No, I'm still not.  If I were in a activity where I was intermingling with the public on a steady regular basis then I would take another look at it.  But since I've kind of withdrawn both my social activities and other things similar to that, I'm not out with people like I used to be so I'm.

DOCTOR X71
And why do you think you've withdrawn like that?

PATIENT X71
From, because I'm no longer in business.  I used to be.

DOCTOR X71
Okay it's because you're retired.

PATIENT X71
I was an active person yeah.  Did you say retarded?

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter).

PATIENT X71
Oh, I thought you were talking to her I'm sorry.

SECOND PERSON X71
Ooh, kid you're gonna get in trouble.

DOCTOR X71
You'd better be careful (laughter).

PATIENT X71
(Laughter).  I have selective hearing.

SECOND PERSON X71
I'll vouch for that.

DOCTOR X71
Alright, so let's see you're on the metoprolol, finasteride, tamsulosin.  Are you taking the baby aspirin?

PATIENT X71
Yes.

DOCTOR X71
Hydrochlorothiazide, Imdur, lisinopril.

PATIENT X71
What's the last one?

DOCTOR X71
Isosorbide mononitrate.

PATIENT X71
Yeah what is it?

DOCTOR X71
Lisinopril, glipizide, lubricating eye ointment.

PATIENT X71
I haven't used that.  That, that scares me.

DOCTOR X71
Uh some glucose or some strips for your machine, simvastatin and that about does it okay.

PATIENT X71
Okay.

DOCTOR X71
Now what happened with this medicine the amlodipine?  Why did they take you off of that, do you remember?  Did you get swelling in your legs or?

PATIENT X71
Yes, quite a bit of swelling.  As a matter of fact I had to uh.

DOCTOR X71
That's the main problem people have with that pill.

PATIENT X71
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X71
So, well I'm trying to come up with you know a reason to stick a needle in you or do something.

PATIENT X71
My customer used to do that to me on a regular basis.

DOCTOR X71
And I'm having trouble coming up with something here.

SECOND PERSON X71
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X71
Um, okay can you have a seat up here for me; I'll look you over here.

PATIENT X71
Could I, in case I forget, and I not the best memory in the world these days, would you be able to renew my uh prescriptions for me?

DOCTOR X71
Oh yeah, we'll redo them.  You get them in the mail right?

PATIENT X71
Yes.

DOCTOR X71
It makes it pretty easy doesn't it?

PATIENT X71
Yes it does except with the uh finasteride and the tamsulosin.

DOCTOR X71
Yeah.

PATIENT X71
They will only send me a one month supply and that gets kind of scary from time to time.

DOCTOR X71
Huh.

PATIENT X71
Maybe that's what's driving my blood pressure up huh?

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter).  Well if that's your biggest problem there I think we're okay.

PATIENT X71
You think so, okay.

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter)

SECOND PERSON X71
(Laughter) @@@.

DOCTOR X71
Alright take some big breaths here.  Good.  Alright and just relax here.  

PATIENT X71
Big breath again?

DOCTOR X71
Just breathe normal.  Breathing sounds good.  Let's see down here, no fluid right?

PATIENT X71
Not that I know of.  I check that on a regular basis.

DOCTOR X71
It looks pretty good and uh you're lying flat at night when you sleep?

PATIENT X71
I use two pillows.

DOCTOR X71
Okay, do you always do that?

PATIENT X71
Yes.

DOCTOR X71
How come?

PATIENT X71
Uh because when I had my cataract surgery they recommended that I do that.

DOCTOR X71
Alright.

PATIENT X71
Should I change that?

DOCTOR X71
I'm just curious if it's because you can't breathe if you.

PATIENT X71
No.

DOCTOR X71
Lay on one or.

PATIENT X71
No, at that time I was having trouble with my eyes and uh they thought that maybe that would be of some help to me, I presume.

DOCTOR X71
Okay.  Alright.  You can go ahead and wait down or sitting in that chair there.  I'm going to run back and talk to one of my bosses.

PATIENT X71
Okay.

DOCTOR X71
And I'll be right back.

PATIENT X71
Okay thank you doctor.

DOCTOR X71
You're welcome.

(DOCTOR OUT:  66:05  DOCTOR IN:  76:24)

DOCTOR X71
Alright so I don't think there's too much that we need to change.  Uh it sounds like everything's going along pretty well.  Uh I was talking to my boss out there about this urinating thing and outside of Urology Service, like a procedure, there's not much else pill-wise that we can do for that.  So if you get to the point where you want there, where they get a line and do kind of a roto rooter job on the prostate uh.  I mean that would probably be the next step but uh I don't think you really want to go forward with that uh at this point.  So what I'm gonna do is um order some blood work that you can have drawn before the next visit uh which will be like in six months or so unless you need to come sooner.  Uh just to check the diabetes and the cholesterol and make sure that we're doing okay uh with that stuff.

PATIENT X71
Will I get a notice of that doctor?

DOCTOR X71
No you'll get a notice with the appointment.  You won't necessarily get a notice that you need to get the blood done.

PATIENT X71
So I'll have to do that on my own?

DOCTOR X71
Yeah.  I put the orders in and then you can go whenever you want.  It's helpful if you come before the visit uh.

PATIENT X71
I would imagine.

DOCTOR X71
Because then we have the results but if it's too much of a hassle, I mean I understand that too if you can't.

PATIENT X71
No.

DOCTOR X71
But I mean if you get it done within a week or so before the appointment that's the best way to do it.

PATIENT X71
Did you make a note of that babe please?

SECOND PERSON X71
Nope.

PATIENT X71
I have to have, I have to have blood work done, that means going downstairs.

DOCTOR X71
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON X71
Not, not today.

DOCTOR X71
Not today.

PATIENT X71
No before the next appointment.

SECOND PERSON X71
@@@.  Okay I will do that.

DOCTOR X71
So I think that's about it.  I think everything else looks okay unless you want us to start giving the shots or something like that.  I don't have much else to do for you.  I think everything looks good.

PATIENT X71
I can renew my @@@ subscription?

DOCTOR X71
You can go right ahead.  I think it'll be worth it for you.

PATIENT X71
I just want to make sure I get my moneys worth.

DOCTOR X71
I refilled all your pills for you.

PATIENT X71
Oh that was my next question.

DOCTOR X71
I'll take care of that.

PATIENT X71
And will I get them automatically now?

DOCTOR X71
They should come in the mail.

PATIENT X71
Okay.

DOCTOR X71
Yep.  So that's about it.

PATIENT X71
That's it.

DOCTOR X71
I think we're doing good.

PATIENT X71
Thank you.  I appreciate it and uh if I could ask you, do you expect to be on the scene here for a while or are you terminating your?

DOCTOR X71
I'm gonna be here for a year and a half.

PATIENT X71
Okay and if I live that long I'll get to see you then.

DOCTOR X71
(Laughter).  Oh you better be careful with those, all those comments.

SECOND PERSON X71
I @@@ too much stuff you got to take care of at home.  Don't talk like that.

DOCTOR X71
You've got too many things for you to fix.

PATIENT X71
She's been talking to you again huh?

DOCTOR X71
Yeah she's making sure I keep you around at least for a while.

PATIENT X71
At least long enough huh.

DOCTOR X71
At least so you get all the housework done.

PATIENT X71
Okay.  We're through doctor?

DOCTOR X71
We're through.

PATIENT X71
Okay, thank you very much.

SECOND PATIENT X71
We get to go in the country, never mind.

DOCTOR X71
You remember where to check out?

PATIENT X71
Uh yes.  When will my next appointment?  Oh six months?

DOCTOR X71
This way and then down the hall.  Yeah six months and uh blood work before and I'll make sure that all your medications are at the right levels.

PATIENT X71
Okay um and I won't, excuse me for repeating myself.  

DOCTOR X71
That's okay.

PATIENT X71
I understand I will not be notified regarding the blood work, that's on my own.

DOCTOR X71
Right.

PATIENT X71
Well how will they know?

DOCTOR X71
So if you just go to the Lab on the third floor they know what to do.

PATIENT X71
Okay.

DOCTOR X71
So it's not an appointment it's just you go whenever it's convenient for you.

PATIENT X71
Okay.

DOCTOR X71
And they know what to do.

PATIENT X71
Okay what would be uh your suggested time?  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, a.m. or p.m.

DOCTOR X71
I would, it's more helpful if you are fasting so if you haven't eaten, so that when they do the blood work, uh so most people like to do it in the morning.

SECOND PERSON X71
That's fine.

PATIENT X71
And what time do they open up?

DOCTOR X71
8:00.

PATIENT X71
They open at 8 okay.  Any particular day better than others?

DOCTOR X71
No just as long as it's a few days or so before the appointment, the day of the week, it doesn't matter.

PATIENT X71
Okay.  Doctor thank you very much.

SECOND PERSON X71
@@@.

DOCTOR X71
Good to see you?

PATIENT X71
Oh my gosh.

DOCTOR X71
Don't worry about it.

PATIENT X71
It's a monthly expense.

DOCTOR X71
Is this yours here?

PATIENT X71
Yes sir it is.

DOCTOR X71
Now don't forget that.

SECOND PERSON X71
See @@@.

PATIENT X71
Well I got that at the Crete Claim Shop.

DOCTOR X71
Right.

PATIENT X71
So I don't think anybody's gonna take that one but oh God.  Now you know why I @@@.

DOCTOR X71
@@@.  You have a good afternoon.  Hopefully it'll be spring next time I see you.

SECOND PERSON X71
Oh God any time, any month.

PATIENT X71
Thank you.

SECOND PERSON X71
We go to the right

PATIENT X71
Is this the way?

SECOND PERSON X71
Another right right?

DOCTOR X71
To go where?

PATIENT X71
Out.

SECOND PERSON X71
Out.

DOCTOR X71
Uh I would go this way.

PATIENT X71
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR X71
Shorter walking.  The very very farthest @@@ is probably on the right.

SECOND PERSON X71
Okay.

DOCTOR X71
But the elevator is right along this corner here.

SECOND PERSON X71
Thank you.

PATIENT X71
Thank you.

DOCTOR X71
You're welcome.

DOCTOR X22
xxx xxx's pretty horrible.

PATIENT X22
(Laughter) Any time huh.

DOCTOR X22
Any time.  They have the worst traffic.  

PATIENT X22
We went down there one time, we were going to Florida of course and we're coming back and it was the final four in basketball and there was, that was on and something else was on and it was raining and the traffic was really horrible and I decided that we never went down 65 again, we always go back through Alabama and all that stuff.

DOCTOR X22
Oh really.  Yeah it's pretty bad.  Where in Florida do you go?

PATIENT X22
xxx xxx beach.

DOCTOR X22
Oh okay.  So you always go back down there?

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.  Yeah see I called in for lisinopril and I spoke to the lady yesterday and I told her I was coming to see you today and she said well you talk with your doctor about getting lisinopril.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.  So, I'm just trying to update all this.  

PATIENT X22
Yeah many years ago my daughter's girlfriend, she went through xxx and now she's got, she's working with a couple other doctors as a cardiologist and so.

DOCTOR X22
Oh really.

PATIENT X22
She went through probably the same thing you're going through now.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.  Where does she work?

PATIENT X22
Downtown city now, she had to stay in the city cause she married a councilman.

DOCTOR X22
Oh yeah.

PATIENT X22
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X22
Where do you get the metformin from?

PATIENT X22
From you I guess.

DOCTOR X22
Well I don't see it.  @@@.  Do you, did you want to pick this stuff up?

PATIENT X22
No just have it shipped to the house, that'd be great.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  So it'll get there before you have to go.

PATIENT X22
Oh gosh yes.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.

PATIENT X22
Cause usually I get it, you know when I call it in, it's you know 5-10 days or less sometimes.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
And uh, we're not gonna be going for another week and a half so I'm okay.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  Um, I'm trying to figure out uh, I'm gonna have to ask how we can give you.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.  Well don't get yourself in trouble doctor, you know hey.

DOCTOR X22
No, no, I'm sure there's a way to do it, I just don't know how, how to get it done.

PATIENT X22
Yeah that's all my doctor.

DOCTOR X22
@@@.

PATIENT X22
Huh?

DOCTOR X22
I got to watch @@@.

PATIENT X22
Oh, I even got one for her.  Yeah, she said in case the paramedics come and get me.  They won't know to look in my purse, I say yes dear.

DOCTOR X22
Um, so your blood pressure looks good.  Are you checking it at home?

PATIENT X22
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X22
And what's it normally?

PATIENT X22
It's usually in the 130s over 70s.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  

PATIENT X22
And then I prick my finger periodically to check diabetes and I'm always under 140.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  When are you checking?

PATIENT X22
I'm checking uh, like, well not today but I have my little list, I should have brought that list for you.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
But like today I would check a.m., you know before breakfast and then two hours afterwards.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
And maybe, today is what Wednesday, Friday I'll check lunch, before lunch and after lunch and Sunday, oh no Sunday.

DOCTOR X22
@@@.

PATIENT X22
No Sunday, Sunday there's a cocktail or two at least on Sunday.

DOCTOR X22
Um so when you do the very early morning ones, what's your numbers?

PATIENT X22
Sometimes it scares the heck out of me doctor.  It's, one time it was like 170-180, something like that.  Gosh I wish I'd brought it with me and I told my wife about it and she says wow, so I rechecked it a couple mornings after that and everything went down.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
And the only thing we can attribute it to is either we had a snack that night or maybe an ice cream or something like that.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
And uh, I'm like a closet drinker, but Fridays I like to have a cocktail Friday evening cause I've done that from the day I started working and then Sunday before dinner and that's about all I drink now days.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
Compared to when I was in my youth.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
But uh, that was the only time it was high.

DOCTOR X22
But that was just one time?

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.  Yeah cause the next morning you know she said let's check it again and then I was down to 127 or something like that.

DOCTOR X22
Okay, alright um, so the early morning ones, do you know what our goal was?

PATIENT X22
All I can do is when I was in for my last uh, uh angiogram my DOCTOR, my regular doctor.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
She uh, she's a diabetic nut and uh she had people from the Diabetes Office come over.

DOCTOR X22
Come by.

PATIENT X22
Come over and talk to me and what they wanted to maintain.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.

PATIENT X22
And they said I was borderline and if I watch what I eat and I do, I work out three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

DOCTOR X22
Great.

PATIENT X22
And uh they said you know I won't have to go on the medicine so and that's what I try and keep that 140 stuff, though under 140s.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  But yeah, so the morning ones anywhere between like 90 and 120.

PATIENT X22
Something like that, yeah and it'll vary in there I mean.

DOCTOR X22
Okay and then the after meal ones anything less than like 150.

PATIENT X22
Oh gosh yeah, they're all down that, it's just and I don't know why, maybe you could tell me doctor.  Why is it, you know you're just laying around, you're sleeping at night and stuff and you're not eating candy bars or anything, why would it go up, I don't know.

DOCTOR X22
Well, so everybody whose normal has your pancreas makes a certain amount of insulin.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
All day and that's the amount that you have whether you're eating, whether you're sleeping, anytime.  So normal people have this basal rate.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
I mean it's a constant rate.  Up here, people with diabetes are a little bit lower so you're not; you're technically not being covered for your normal sugars during the night.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
With diabetes.

PATIENT X22
Cause my body is resting yeah.

DOCTOR X22
Right because you don't have.

PATIENT X22
I'm not active or something.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah and you don't have your pancreas making that insulin.  

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
So that's kind of what the medications are for either to help you make more of your own.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
Or to help you be more sensitive to the amount that you are making by yourself.

PATIENT X22
I think what you're saying then is I'm a good boy and I'm okay.  (Laughter)

DOCTOR X22
Yeah I think you're doing great.  Um, we haven't checked your A1c in a while.

PATIENT X22
What's that?

DOCTOR X22
Your, that tells me how well you're doing with your diabetes. Um, I can show it to you here so.

PATIENT X22
When I was here last time uh, DOCTOR she had me you know when I left her.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
She had me go downstairs and they drew some blood out of me.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.

PATIENT X22
If that's what you're talking about.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah so that was back in March and its good, anything below 7 or below.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
Is good um and you've been right at 7, a little less previously, um for the diabetes.  So I think um.  Have you eaten anything today?

PATIENT X22
Yeah I had breakfast.

DOCTOR X22
You have eaten.  

PATIENT X22
I had you know a small bowel of oatmeal.

DOCTOR X22
Cause I think we need to check your.

PATIENT X22
She wasn't too concerned about that.  Cause I, she asked me when the last time I saw her before she moved on.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
And uh I said well I had breakfast this morning and she said I don't think it'll hurt anything.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah, if we were checking your cholesterol it would be an issue but today we don't need to check the cholesterol.  

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
She checked that last time.  Um, so we can get the test done today.

PATIENT X22
You mean stop on the way out and draw a gallon of blood.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
Or something.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah just a gallon.

PATIENT X22
(Laughter)

DOCTOR X22
Um, so that way I can see whether or not we need to go up on your medications.

PATIENT X22
Sure.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  

PATIENT X22
But @@@.  Let me be up frank with you, now I have a cardiologist DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X22
Right.

PATIENT X22
And I, if he tells me to jump ten times I'm gonna do it.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
Cause he's been keeping me going.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.

PATIENT X22
Cause the history of my family; I'm the first male to get past 57.

DOCTOR X22
Wow.

PATIENT X22
So whatever he's doing to me.

DOCTOR X22
Is good.

PATIENT X22
Look I want to stay with him.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.  Um, yeah and any changes that he makes, just let me know.

PATIENT X22
That's what I've done with DOCTOR too, any time he would change something and stuff like that; I would fax a copy to her, attention to.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.

PATIENT X22
Yeah.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah just send along the same thing.

PATIENT X22
Now do you have the same fax number as DOCTOR?  Okay so everything is the same.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X22
I got it written at home then yeah.

DOCTOR X22
Yep, I'll @@@.  So you have your eye exam.

PATIENT X22
Yes.

DOCTOR X22
That was back in February.

PATIENT X22
Yeah she wanted to make sure to look back and I faxed her the report on that too.

DOCTOR X22
Good.  So you get that done outside of the VA?

PATIENT X22
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  So same thing though whenever you have it again in February of this coming year.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
Just fax the report.

PATIENT X22
Or if I come to see you, I'll bring it in here yeah.

DOCTOR X22
That would be good, either way.  Um, your cholesterol looks great; your blood pressure looks great.  Uh the only thing I wanted to check was your kidney function today um.  People with diabetes sometimes um, in their urine have a little bit of protein.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
And that kind of tells us how your kidneys are doing as far as the diabetes.  Um, it hasn't been checked in a while, in a couple years.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
So just to screen you and make sure you're okay.

PATIENT X22
Sure, I don't care, great.  No I did a urine test the last time I was here.

DOCTOR X22
@@@ This particular test.

PATIENT X22
Cause are we talking about peeing in the cup?

DOCTOR X22
Yeah that may have been um.

PATIENT X22
Cause they drew blood and they gave me a little paper cup to pee in.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah, well the only one I see is from 07.

PATIENT X22
Maybe that stuff was lost huh, who knows.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.

PATIENT X22
Maybe @@@ doctor.

DOCTOR X22
I hope not.  Um, yeah I think, I mean it's a painless test.

PATIENT X22
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X22
So um.  We can do that today and check the A1c and I think as far as everything else goes, we can keep doing what we're doing.

PATIENT X22
Great.  @@@ doctor.

DOCTOR X22
Alright.  And you've had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT X22
I had one about a year ago, two years ago.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.  Let's see when that was.

PATIENT X22
Hey did you increase my lisinopril or refill it so I can get more of that?  Cause they said when I called uh, they said that it's been.

DOCTOR X22
That it was expired.

PATIENT X22
Expired, big word I couldn't think of that.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.  Um.

PATIENT X22
Do you want this blood work from here?  This is from.

DOCTOR X22
Oh yeah.  Where is this from?

PATIENT X22
That's from DOCTOR; in fact it's my wife's doctor.  Nice lady.

DOCTOR X22
And this was.

PATIENT X22
This was a while back.

DOCTOR X22
Oh yeah okay.

PATIENT X22
And that was because I had this before and then.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
DOCTOR cancelled something and then uh.

DOCTOR X22
@@@.

PATIENT X22
Then DOCTOR or something like that.

DOCTOR X22
DOCTOR.

PATIENT X22
DOCTOR, he wanted me to come in and then he cancelled on me and then you got stuck with me (laughter).

DOCTOR X22
No I'm not stuck.  Um, so this um, the hemoglobin A1c what we were talking about.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
Is 7.4 here, so that's a little, that's worse than the one that we drew.

PATIENT X22
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR X22
Back in March, but I think at that point the metformin was increased to 500 twice a day.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X22
Which is what you're taking now.

PATIENT X22
Yeah.

DOCTOR X22
So now today, this will be even more meaningful, that way I can see how much better you are.

PATIENT X22
Sure.

DOCTOR X22
From that.

PATIENT X22
I'm here hon.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.

PATIENT X22
I'm easy; I'll do whatever you tell me.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.

PATIENT X22
You doctors are keeping me going.

DOCTOR X22
(Laughter).  Okay.

PATIENT X22
Now the colonoscopy, I will have that done over at uh the gastrologist's in xxx xxx.

DOCTOR X22
Okay and you won't need another one for ten years.

PATIENT X22
No, they found a polyp.  They sent me a letter, a card and they wanted it done next year cause then that would be two years or three years or something.

DOCTOR X22
Oh so they want you to have another one?

PATIENT X22
I don't want to do it but.

DOCTOR X22
Okay so this says benign polyps.

PATIENT X22
Yes.

DOCTOR X22
But I guess not.

PATIENT X22
I really don't want to, that's, of course that's something.

DOCTOR X22
You don't happen to have the report do you?

PATIENT X22
Uh you should have a copy of it, not you but I mean your computer should.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.  I'll have to check and see, I don't see it.

PATIENT X22
If not I can go back to Gastrology and get it and then.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah, just probably fax me.

PATIENT X22
I'd better write that, you're not going to keep this paper here then?

DOCTOR X22
Uh, if it's mine for the keeping I'll keep it.

PATIENT X22
Oh yeah, you keep that.  Can I borrow one of your pens?

DOCTOR X22
Sure.

PATIENT X22
Cause then I can write my love notes to myself.

DOCTOR X22
(Laughter).  (Doctor using keyboard, entering data).

PATIENT X22
So you want the.  Is it DOCTOR or DOCTOR, your last name DOCTOR?

DOCTOR X22
Yeah, an aol.  

PATIENT X22

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.  Okay.  Have you gotten your flu shot?

PATIENT X22
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  Was there here or somewhere else?

PATIENT X22
That was at Walgreens.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  

PATIENT X22
I sound like @@@ old man but my wife sure takes care of me.

DOCTOR X22
That's what she's there for right?

PATIENT X22
Yeah.

DOCTOR X22
That's fine with me.  Okay.  So you haven't had a tetanus shot in ten years right?  Do remember getting a tetanus shot any time recently.

PATIENT X22
God I hate to tell you this I don't know.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  Cause the.

PATIENT X22
If I got it, I would've got it here.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  Um.  According to this you haven't had one in ten years and they need to be repeated every ten years.

PATIENT X22
Okay.

DOCTOR X22
So we can do that today.

PATIENT X22

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  (Doctor working on computer).  @@@.  Um do you have any pain when you walk.  Are you able to exercise and walk?

PATIENT X22
I have arthritis of the feet, of both feet.

DOCTOR X22
No pain in your calves or anything while you're exercising?

PATIENT X22
No I get a pain uh, in my left calf down here.  This is where even I had the bypass; this is where he took the vein out.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
But this one is still here, but this is my worst foot.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.  Have you ever had um any studies done about your arteries down in your legs?

PATIENT X22
I had the ultrasound done on them and then I have two stents, one in each leg here.

DOCTOR X22
Oh okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X22
They have fun on me in an airport.

DOCTOR X22
You get to @@@ off?

PATIENT X22
Yeah I have ten; I have ten in my fat body.

DOCTOR X22
You have ten.  Uh and no chest pains, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X22
Oh yeah I get shortness of breath but I think that goes with the territory, with everything I've got wrong with me.

DOCTOR X22
Okay, is that any different than normal?

PATIENT X22
It's normal yeah.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.

PATIENT X22
I used to be able to walk the tracks, walk the track at the Rex Plex but uh now maybe I'll do one lap and then go on the machines and I work my upper body more, more so than.

DOCTOR X22
Is this because of shortness of breath?

PATIENT X22
Right.  I have an exercycle, I got an Aerodyne at home and I have a treadmill but I'm more comfortable on the Aerodyne cause my feet don't hurt on that.

DOCTOR X22
Alrighty.  I think we've covered everything.  Do you want to hop up here sir?

PATIENT X22
Sure.

DOCTOR X22
Thanks.  

PATIENT X22
Tie my shoe laces, so I don't trip.

DOCTOR X22
For any ulcers or any.

PATIENT X22
Oh no I ain't got that no.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah, do you have any kind of loss of sensation, sometimes @@@.

PATIENT X22
Sure.

DOCTOR X22
Appetite's okay?

PATIENT X22
Yes. 

DOCTOR X22
Too good sometimes.

PATIENT X22
I can't eat as much as I used to and I don't know why.  Instead at uh, like lunch when I get home now.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22
I'll have a half of sandwich and I'm full.  Like I just ate a turkey dinner or something like that.  I'm kind of full.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.  Sometimes that can go with diabetes; it gives you a full feeling.

PATIENT X22
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X22
It has to do with how your stomach moves because of diabetes.

PATIENT X22
Yeah.

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.

PATIENT X22
Huh.

DOCTOR X22
Are you nauseous at all?

PATIENT X22
No.

DOCTOR X22
Okay.

No the only thing, like I say in the evening when I take the dog out, @@@, I'll take it out and if it's cold like it was last night.

DOCTOR X22
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X22

DOCTOR X22
Yeah.  I can feel it on both sides.

PATIENT X22
Hmm.

DOCTOR X22

(DOCTOR OUT:  67:06  DOCTOR IN:  79:02)


PATIENT X22
Hey there.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Not bad, how are you?

PATIENT X22
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Good to see you.  Where you going for three months?

PATIENT X22
Well, I'm going down to my son in xxx and his family, spend Christmas down with them and then we're gonna go to St. xxx's.  

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Are you gonna go to that new cowboy dome?

PATIENT X22
No he lives up in McKinney, Texas, north of there.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
So he's kind of in the open area?

PATIENT X22
I don't know.  You know usually when I get down there, I park my car and then they take us all over the place.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Very nice.  Then you're gonna go to St. xxx's?

PATIENT X22
Yeah then we're gonna go to St. xxx's Beach and then um, I guess @@@.  A friend of ours has a condo there and he works for a living so he can't go down so he's giving it to me almost for free.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Okay.  

PATIENT X22
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Sounds like fun.

PATIENT X22
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
And then you're gonna take your medications as prescribed I take it?

PATIENT X22
I'd like to.  

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Yeah.

PATIENT X22
That's why I was talking to the doctor.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
So, I think we'll change most of the medications to 90 days supply.  It's just a pain in the butt to get them every 30 days anyway.

PATIENT X22
It is.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Um the Plavix or clopidogrel is really essential.

PATIENT X22
Yeah that's what I was telling to the doctor and.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
And uh the VA only gives us a 30 day allotment, but you're going somewhere so stop by the Pharmacy today and say hey you know my doctor changed my other prescriptions to 90 days, can I have a three months supply of this medication because I'm leaving town.

PATIENT X22
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
Then they should say okay.

PATIENT X22
Yeah cause I'm covered for December, the month of December.

SECOND DOCTOR X22
No but I'm just saying do that, go to Pharmacy today.  You might have to wait like an hour to find the pharmacist but you're leaving town.

PATIENT X22
Well I'm not leaving yet, so they could mail it if they can.

FIRST DOCTOR X22
I think you told me how often.

PATIENT X22

SECOND DOCTOR X22

SECOND DOCTOR X22
